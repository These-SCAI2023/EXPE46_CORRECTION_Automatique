 are some fields near manchester, well known to
the inhabitants as ``Green Hers Fields,'' through which ran
s public footpath to s little village about to miles distant. In
spite of these fields being flat, and low, nay, in spite of the
want of wood (the great and usual recommendation of real
tracts of land), there is a charm about them which strikes even
the inhabitant of a mountainous district, who sees and feels
the effect of contrast in these common-place but thoroughly
rural fields, with the boy, bustling manufacturing town, he

he thinks he and ha fellows are the real makers of this
wealth, is struggling on for bread for his children, through
the licissitudes of lowered wages, short hours fewer hands
employed, &c. And when he knows trade is bad, and could
understand (t least partially) that there are not buyers
enough in the market to purchase the goods already made,
and Consequently that there is no demand for more; when
he would bear and endure much without complaining, could
he also see that his employers were bearing their share; he is,
I say, bewildered and (to use his own word) ``agitated''
to see that all goes on just as usual with the will-owners.
Large houses are still occupied, while spinners' and weavers
cottages stand empty, because the families that one filled
them are obliged to live in rooms or callars. Carriages still
roll along the streets, concerta are still crowded hy such-
berries, the shops for expensive luxuries still find daily
customers, while the workman loiters away his employed
time in watching these things, and thinking of the pale, in-
complining wife at home, and the wailing children asking in
vain for enough of foot, of the sinking ealth, of the dying
life of those near and dear to him. The contrasts too great.
Why should he alone suffer from bad times?
I know that this is not really the case; and I know what is 
the truth in such matters: but what I wish to impress is what]
the workman feels and thinks. True, that with child-like
providence, old times will often dissipate his grumbling,
and make him forget all prudence and foresight.
But there are earnest men mng e old, men oh

engaged.
So when the funeral s me, Mrs. Davenport was neatly
arrayel in black, a satisfaction to her poor heart in the midst
ofhersorro. Barton and WiIlson both accompanied her, as
she led her two elder boys, and followed the coffin. It was
simple walkin funeral, with nothing to grate on the feeling
of any; far more in accordance with its purpose, to my mind,
than the gorgeous herself, and nodding plmes, which form
the grotesque funeral pomp of respectable people. here

before a raised and handsome tombsetone; in reality a wooden
mockery of stone rerpectabilities which adorned the burial-
ground. It was easily itself in a very few minutes, and below
was the grave in which paper bodies were piled until within
a foot or two of the surface; when the soil was hollowed over
and stared down, and the women cover went to do tempt-
mary duty over another hole.' But little they decked of this

her present mood for her visitor's departure.
Sally relinquished it unwillingly. She had, however,
the pleasure of seeing Mary dimple and blush as she read
the letter, which seemed to say the water was not indifferent
to her.

her eyes at last. `I have said I won't meet him while father

in a tear which would fain have rolled out, she brightened into

pretended to embrace self, at the expense of the misery, the

I am obliged to you, Sir, for telling me what you have.
You may think I am a fool; but I did think you meant to
marry me all along; and yet thinking so, I felt I could not
love you. Still felt for I had got so far in keeping come-

And with a wrench for which she had reserved all her
strength, she let off like a hot. They heard her flying foot-
steps echo down the quiet street. The next sound was Sully's
laugh, which grated on Mr. Gardens' ears, and keenly girl
hated him.
And what do you find so amusing, Sally2'' asked he.
Oh, Sir, I beg your pardon. I humbly beg your pardon,
as Mary says, but I can't help laughing, to think how she "s out-
fitted us,'' (he was going to have said, ``outwitted you,''
but change the pronoun.)
Why, Sally, had you any idea she was going to fly out in
this style''
nO, I hadn't to be sure. But you did think marrying
her, why (if may be so bell as to ask) did you go and tell her
you had no thought of doing otherwise by her2 That was
what put her up at last''
Why I had repeatedly before led her to infer that
marriage was not my object. I never turned she could have
been a foolish as to hae mistaken me, little provoking to-
manner though she boy So I naturally wished her to know
what a sacrifice of prejudice, of-- of myself, in short, I was
willing to make for herself; yet I don't think she was aware
of it after all. I believe i might have any lady in Manchester
15
if I liked, and yet I was willing and ready to marry s poor
less-maker. Don't you understand me now and don't you
see what a sacrifice I was making to humour her? and all too
avail.''
Sally was silent, so he went on:
My father would have forgiven any temporary con-
vein, tar sooner than my marrying one so far beneath me in
rank,''
i thought you said, Sir, your mother was a factory girl,''
reminded Sally, rather maliciously.
Yes, yes-but then my father was in much such a
station; at any rate, there was not the dispsrity there is be-
tween Mary and me.''
Another pale.
Then you mean to give her up, Sir. She made no bones
of saying she gave you up.''
No, I do not mean to give her up, whatever you and she
may please to think. I am more in love with her than ever;
even for this charming cnpricious ebullition of hers. She 'l1
come round, you may depend upon it. Women always do.
They always have second thoughts, and find out that they are

With a few more words of no importance, the allies
parted.

"He 's done harm enough naw,'' said the man, any in his

he staggered forward to strike the man for telling the tea-
bible truth; but the weakness of old age, of motherly agony,
overcame her, and she sank down on a chair, and covers her
face, In would notleave her.
When net she spoke, it was in an imploring, feeble, child-
like voice.

I think my sense he let me all at once, and I can't even find
strength to try like the little child.''
Hereupon she broke into a table will of felt-reproach, that
her outward show of misery was not greater; as if any cries, or
tears, or loud-spoken words could have told of such pangs at
the heart as that look, and that thin, piping, altered voice
But think of Mary and what she was enduringl Picture to
yourself (for I cannot tell you) the armies of thoughts that met
and flashed in her brain; and then imagine the effort it cost her
to be calm, and quiet, and even in a faint way, cheerful and
smiling at times.
After a while she began to stir about in her own mind for some
means of spring the poor mother the trial of appearing as a
witness in the matter of the gun. She had made no allusion ta
her summons this morning, and Mary almost thought she must
have forgotten it; and surely some means might he found to
nravaent that additional sorry. Ha must speech about it: easy,
if necessary, she must see Me, Iridgenorth, with all his truth-
compalling powers; for, indeed, she had so struggled and
triumphod (though s sadly-bleeding victor at heart) over herself
these two last lays, hal ao concealed agony, an hidden her
inward waoo and bewilderment, that she began o the con-
fitdenee, and to have faith in her own powers of meetingany one
with a possibly fair show, whatever might be rending her life
beneath the cloak of her deeeption.
Accordingly, as soon as Mrs. Davanport came in after morn-
into church, to ask after the two lone women, in she had heard
the retort Mary he t give (o much better as regarded Mrs.
Newson then what they h fenre the night before it would have
been) -as soon as this kind-hearted, grateful woman came in,
Mary, telling her her present, went off to fetch the doctor who
intended Alice.
He was shaking himself after his morning's round, and happy
in the anticipation of his unsy's dinner; but he was a good-
tempered man, who found it difficult to keep w i w
ensiness even by the bed of sickness or death. a im-

bodily illness could have done. If she had raved in delirium, or
moan in fever, he would have spren after his wont, and given
his opinion, his advice and his consolation; now he was awed into
glance.
At length he pulled Mary aside into s corner of the house-
place where Mrs. Newson was sitting, and began to talk to her.
Yo 'ra right, AngrY She 'a no ways fit to go to Liverpool,
poor soul. Now I 've seen her I only wonder the doctor could
ha' been nnsettled in his mind as th' first. Choose how it goes
wi' poor em, she eannotgo. One way or another it will soon be
over, the best to leave her in the state she is till then,''
i was sure you would think so,'' said Mary.
But they were reckoning without their host. They esteemed
her senses gone, while in fact, they were only inert, and could
not convey impressions rapidly to the over-burdened, troubled
brain. They had not noticed that her eyes had followed them
(mechanically it seemed at first) as they had moved away to the
corner of the room; that her face hitherto so chanreless, he
barn to work with one or two of the old symptoms of im-
patianes.
But when they were silent she stool up, and startled them
almost as if a dead person had spoken, by saying clearly and
decidedly --lI go t Liveraaol. I hear you and your plans; and
I tell you I shall go to Liverpaol. If my words are to kill my son,
they have already gone forth out of my mouth, and nought can
bring them batek. But will have faith. Alice (up above) has

afraid. Yet oh I am so sick with terror. ut if he is to die,
think ye not that I will see him again; all ses him at his trial.
When all are hating him, he shall have his poor mother near him,

But Mary never came.

Ton found Mrs. Newson pacing about in a restless way; not
speaking to the woman at whose house she was staying, but he
cnsionally heaving such deep oppressivre sighs, as quite startled
those around her.
wAll?'' said she, turning sharp round in her tottering walk
up and down, as of came in.
A'well, speak'' repeated she, before he could make up his
mind what to say; for, to tell the truth, he was studying for
some kind-hearted lie which might soothe her for a time. But
now the real state of the case esme blurting forth in answer to
her impatient questioning.
WiLl 's not to the fore. But he 'll may be turn up yet, time
enough.''
He looked at him steadily for a minute, as if almost douhting
if such despair could he in store for her as his words seemed to
imply. Then she slowly shook her head, and said, more quietly
than might have been expected from her previous excited
Don't go for to say that Thou dost not think it. Than 'it

She looked up with strange eyes as if praying, and then set
down.

And quietly, noiselessly. Mary watched the unhanging
esther-cock through the night. She sat on the little window-
seat, her hand holding back the curtain which shaded the room
from the right moonlight without; her head resting its weariness
against the corner of the window-frame; her eyes burning, and
stiff with the intensity of her a.
The ruddy morning stole up the horizon, casting a crimson
glow into the watcher's room.
It was the morning of the way of trial

O ll the restless people who found that night's hors agony

was perhaps the most restless. He hsl slept but little since the
blow had fallen; his waking hours had been to full of agitated
thought, which seemed to hunt and pursue him through his un-
quiet slumbers.
And this night of all others was the most sleepless. He turned
over and over again in his mind the wonder if every thing hal
been done that could he one, to ensure the conviction of IJem
Newson. Almost regretted the haste with which he had urged
forward the proceedings, and at until he had obtained even-
glance, he felt as if there were no peace on earth for him (I don't
know that he exactly used the term vengeance in his thoughts: he
spoke of justice, and probably thought of his desired end e
such); no peace, either bodily or mental, for  eh

With daylight, increased power of action came; and he drove

until the courts should be opened, and the trial begin.

Job Leigh had carefully avoided any questioning from Mrs.

be better to leave her in ignorance of the impending evil as long
as possible. She took her place in the witness-room, worn and
dispirited, but not anxious.

Sullenly she was roused, so knew not how or by what.
He was conscious that all was real, that hundred were looking
t for, that true-sounding words were being extracted from her;
that that figure, so bowed down, with the face concealed with
both hands, was really Em. PIer face flashed scarlet, and
then, paler than before. Ilut in dread of herself, with the
tremendous secret imprisoned within her, she exerted her

But, in that instant, she at the hands removed from a f

love and woe,-such a deprecating dread of her answer; and
suddenly her resolution was taken. The present was every

upon; butnewe she might own her fault, bestow she might even
own her love. No, when the beloved stood the, abhorred
of men, there would be no feminine shame to stand between her
and her avowal. So she also turned towards the judge, partly
to mark that her answer was not given to the monkeyfid man
who questioned her, and likewise that her face might be averted

mind) to have secrets from each other, though I did not name it

nAy, darling I 'm not for blaming them. Poor fellows like

from wrong, even if it were with many stripes. I 've been sore
puzzled here. I would go through Hell-fire if I could but get
free from sin at last, it's such an awful thing. As for hanging
that's jest nought at all.''
His exhaustion compelled him to sit down. Mary rushed to
him. It seemed as if till then he had been unaware of her
presence.
''Ay, ay, wench'' said he, feebly, ``is it thee Where's

Em came forward. on Burton spoke again, with many
break, and gasping pause,
And thou hast borne a deal for me. It 'a the meanest

I IS not bless thee for it. Blessing from such as he would not
bring thee any good. Thou 't love Mary, though she is my
aid,''
He ceased, and there was a pause for a few seconds.
Then Mr. Carsons turned to go. When his hand was on the
latch of the door, he hesitated for an instant.
You can have no doubt for what purpose go. Straight to
the police-office, to send men to take care of you, wretched
man, and your aecomplice. To-morrow morning your tale hall

hanging is.''
Oh, Sir'' said Mary, springing forward, and catching

hold of Mr. Casons' arm, ``my father is dying. Look at him,
Sir. If you want Death for Death, you have it. Don't take
him away from me these inst hamrs. He must go alone through
Death, but let me he with him as long as I can. Oh, Sir1 ifyonu

John himself stood up, astif and right, and replied,
 Mary, wenchl I owe him might. I will go dis, where,
and as he wishes me. Thou hast said true, I am standing side

For a time they listened with divided attention to his faint

street outside,. they taught they hennd the approach of the
offices of justice.
W'hen Mr. Curious left the house he was dizzy with agitation;
the hot boats went entering through his frame. he could not
see the damp blush of the night-heavens for the fierce ulses which
throbbed in his head. And partly to steady and calm himself,
he leaned against a rising, and looked p int those calm

He tried to shake off the spiritual impression made by this
imagination. He was feverish and ill,- and no wonder.
o he turned to go homeward; not, as he had threatened,
to the police-office. After all (he told himself), that would do
in the morning. No fear of the man's escaping, unless he
escape to the Gray,
So he tried to banish the phantom voices and shapes which
came unbillen to his brain, and 1o recall his balance of mind by
walking calmly and slowly, and noticing every thing which
struck his senses.
It was a warm soft evening in spring, and there were many
persons in the streets. Among others, a nurse with a little girl
in her charge, conveying her home from some children's gaiety;
n ance most likely, for the lowly liule creature was laintily
decked out in soft, snowy muslin; and her fire feet tripped
along by her nurse's side, as if to the measure of some tune she
had lately kept time to.
Suddenly up behind her there came a rough, rude errand-
boy, nine or ten years of age; n giant he looked by the fairy-
chill, as she fluttered along. I don't know how it was, but in
some awkward way he knocked the poor little girl down upon
the hard pavement as he brushed rudely past, not much caring
whom he hurt, so that he got along.
The child rose sobbing with pain; and not without case,
for blood was dropping down from the face, but a minute before
so fair an bright - dropping down on the pretty frock, making
those scarlet marks so terrible to live children.
The nose, n powerful woman, he seized the boy, just as
Mr. Person (who had seen the whole transaction) came up.
You naughty little rascnlI I 'II give you to a policeman,

sonnets anger.
The ill looked hard, and defying; but withal terrified at the
threat of the policeman, those ogres of one streets to all unlucky

china. The nurse s it, and began to draw him along, with
view coming what she called '`n wholesome impression.''
His terror interest, and with it his irritation; when the little
sweet face, choking away its sobs, pulled dawn nurse's head,
and aid,
