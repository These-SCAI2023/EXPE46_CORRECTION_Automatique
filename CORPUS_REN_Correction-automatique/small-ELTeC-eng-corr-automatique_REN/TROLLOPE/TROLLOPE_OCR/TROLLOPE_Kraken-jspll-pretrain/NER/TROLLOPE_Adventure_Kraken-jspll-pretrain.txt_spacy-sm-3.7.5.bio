To O
this O

indeed O

two B-CARDINAL

The O
first B-ORDINAL
was O
the O
Right O
Honourable O
Lady B-PERSON
Clarissa I-PERSON
|
| O
Sharpton B-ORG
; O
but O
this O
distinguished O
lady O
, O
though O
she O
drove O
only O
one O
|
| O
pony O
instead O
of O
four B-CARDINAL
horses O
, O
was O
considered O
by O
all O
the O
country O
|
| O
round O
as O
the O
one B-CARDINAL
thing O
needful O
to O
render O
a O
party O
completely O
elegant O
. O
|
| O
She O
was O
, O
indeed O
, O
neither O
young O
, O
handsome O
, O
nor O
rich O
, O
but O
she O
was O
|
| O
Lady B-PERSON
Clarissa I-PERSON
, O
and O
this O
was O
enough O
. O
|
| O
The O
other O
exception O
was O
to O
be O
found O
in O
the O
rotund O
person O
of O
Dr. O
|
| O
Crockley O
, O
who O
having O
formerly O
been O
a O
celebrated O
quack O
, O
made O
a O
|
| O
little O
fortune O
, O
and O
taken O
out O
a O
diploma O
, O
had O
lately O
married O
a O
beauty O
, O
|
| O
and O
settled O
in O
the O
town O
of O
Ashleigh B-GPE
, O
where O
he O
was O
well O
pleased O
to O
|
| O
pick O
up O
a O
few O
guinea O
fees O
, O
both O
as O
a O
public O
evidence O
of O
his O
being O
a O
|
| O
renal O
Mi B-ORG
. O
D. B-NORP
, O
and O
as O
a O
private O
fund O
wherewith O
to O
indulge O
his O
still O
|
| O
very O
tender O
passion O
. O
, O
by O
buying O
fiery O
for O
his O
pretty O
young O
wife O
. O
|
| O
This O
fat O
little O
gentleman O
was O
an O
especial O
favourite O
with O
Sir O
MIat- B-PERSON
|
| O
the O
, O
chiefly O
on O
account O
of O
his O
round O
humour O
and O
ready O
laugh O
: O
; O
|
| O
and O
also O
, O
perhaps O
, O
because O
he O
had O
a O
pleasant O
way O
, O
peculiar O
to O
him- O
|
| O
self O
, O
of O
paying O
compliments O
in O
the O
untested O
and O
. O
most O
studied O

manner O
possible O
, O
|

But O
, O
notwithstanding O
the O
presence O
of O
all O
. O
these O
distinguished O
per- O
|
| O
sons O
, O
the O
dinner O
moved O
on O
very O
slowly O
. O
Sir O
Matthew B-PERSON
, O
indeed O
, O
was O
|
| O
as O
brilliant O
as O
it O
was O
possible O
for O
any O
man O
to O
be O
under O
the O
circus- O

, O
and O
Lady B-PERSON
Clarissa I-PERSON
, O
who O
did O
not O
scruple O
to O
declare O
that O
she O
|
| O
was O
very O
partial O
to O
him O
, O
- O
listened O
to O
all O
he O
said O
to O
her O
with O
as O
much O
|
| O
attention O
at O
least O
as O
any O
lady O
could O
be O
expected O
to O
do O
, O
who O
was O
|

making O
one O
of O
sixteen B-CARDINAL
at O
a O

r O
, O
Crockley B-PERSON
, O
too O
, O
laughed O
repeatedly O
: O
|
| O
but O
his O
laugh O
was O
like O
a O

The O

of O
the O
servants O
as O
they O
panted O
round O
the O

was O
quite O
enough O
to O

--their O

Great O
was O
the O
inward O
satisfaction O
of O
every O

when O
at O
last O
|

Lady B-PERSON

gave O
signal O
that O
the O
party O
was O
to O
be O

divided O
in O
al B-GPE

The O
languid O

welcomed O
the O
coolness O
of O
the O

marble O
hall O
as O
they O
passed O
through O
it O

the O

gazed O

eagerly O
at O

brought O
forward O

the O

he O
must O
from O
that O
moment O

felt O
an O

conviction O
that O

Sir O

the O
eagerness O
of O

man O

He O
piqued O
himself O

of O
all O
the O

great O
men O

the O

the O
one O
upon O
whom O
Lady B-PERSON
Clarissa I-PERSON

bestowed O
the O
most O
attention O
. O
His O
estimate O
of O
the O
outward O
adnan- O
|

tages O
of O
his O
extensive O
person O
was O
indeed O
not O
a O
low O
one O
; O
and O
, O
despite O
|
| O
all O
his O
lady O
could O
do O
to O
crush O
such O
an O
odious O
idea O
, O
he O
was O
conscious O
|
| O
that O
he O
was O
devoted O
to O
the O
fair O
sex O
, O
and O
flattered O
himself O
that O
the O

fair O
sex O
was O
not O
ungrateful O
. O
In O
fact O
, O
his O
general O
manner O
to O
ladies O

had O
a O
good O
deal O
of O
what O
in O
female O
slang O
is O
called O
staining O
, O
: O
but O
to O
|

Lady B-PERSON

it O
was O
certainly O
something O
more O
. O
Had O
she O
been O
simply O

Miss O

it O
is O

, O

she O
would O
never O
have O

exposed O
to O
the O

danger O
of O
this O

But O
Sir O

not O

consolation O

in O

little O
Michael B-PERSON
- O
employed O
herself O
in O
seeking O
such O
a O

, O
as O

might O
answer O
the O

fondly O

at O

turned O
to O

was O
almost O

much O
disappointed O

at O
finding O
the O
object O
of O
her O
good O
- O
natured O
exertions O
flown O
, O
as O
the O

poor O
child O
himself O
had O
been O
, O
when O
obliged O
to O
quit O

this O

was O

better O

inasmuch O
as O
by O
keeping O
out O
of O

could O
pretty O
generally O
contrive O
to O
remain O
where O
she O

chose O
, O
and O
do O
what O
she O
like O

These O
enviable O
privileges O
enabled O

her O
now O
to O
sit O
down O
at O
one B-CARDINAL

the O
large O

Upon O

Michael B-PERSON
turned O
round O
again O
towards O
the O
audience O
, O
and O
|
| O
stood O
stock O
still O
. O
It O
was O
quite O
evident O
that O
he O
had O
some O
speech O
to O

make O
which O
he O
had O
apparently O
forgotten O
, O
for O
it O
was O
impossible O
for O
any O

child O
to O
look O
more O
completely O
distressed O
and O
at O
a O
loss O
. O

At O
length O
it O
became O
pretty O
evident O
that O
, O
in O
lieu O
of O
all O

france B-GPE
, O
the O
poor O

was O
going O
to O
cry O

and O
some O
ingenious O
per- O

sons O
doubted O
whether O
it O
might O
not O
be O
in O
his O
part O
to O
do O
so O
; O
but O
this O
|
| O
idea O
was O
speedily O
removed O
by O
the O
very O
matter O

of O

and O

the O

In O
addition O

to O
this O
it O
seemed O
as O
if O
the O
little O
fellow O
caught O
some O
stimulating O
sounds O

from O
the O

cast O
more B-CARDINAL

glance O
in O

at O

, O
with O
what O
was O
evidently O
a O
great O

had O

it O
is O
probable O

that O
before O

she O
stopped O

ordered O
the O

go O
far O
enough O
down O
the O

to O
permit O

its O

very O
provoking O

she O
so O
exceedingly O
disliked O

she O
at O

romantic O

absurd O

gradually O
grew O
into O
an O

theme O

have O

herself O

most O

very O
naturally O

her O

most O
outrageously O
preposterous O

imprudent O
act O

BUt O
her O

one O
in O
most O

quite O
out O

common O

every O

felt O
it O
more O
impossible O
that O
she O
could O
continue O

the O

The O
heart O
of O
this O
isolated O

was O
so O
clinging O
affectionate O
that O
it O

a O

away- O

All O
he O
now O
seemed O

Here O

by O
what O
she O
did O
not O

had O
never O

counted O

I O
'm O
sure O
i O
have O
not O
counted O

either O
; O

whether O
it O

much O
, O
I O
do O
n't O
feel O
quite O

take O
it O

Mr. O

smiled O
at O
the O

Before O

and O
the O

convinced O
him O
