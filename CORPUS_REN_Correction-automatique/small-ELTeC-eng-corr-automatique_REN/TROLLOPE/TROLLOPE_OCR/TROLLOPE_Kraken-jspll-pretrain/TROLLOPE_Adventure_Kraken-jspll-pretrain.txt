P R E FAC E.
WOn the author of ` Michael Armstrong'' first determined on
attempting to draw the attention of her countrymen to the fearful
evils inherent in the Factory system, as carried out in our manual-
turing towns, she intended to divide her work into two portions, which
should present the same subject under two different phases. It was
her intention in the first of these to drag into the light of day, and
place before the eyes of Englishmen, the hideous mass of injustice
and suffering to which thousands of infant labourers are subjected, who
toil in our monster spinning-mills. In the second, she proposed that the
hero of her tale, having lived through his toil-worn boyhood, should
have been seen embark in those perfectly constitutional struggles
For the amelioration of the sufferings of his class, in which many of
the more enlightened operatives have been for some years engaged.
The st division of the subject has been some time in the reader's
hands. The true but most painful picture has been drawn faithfully
ant conscientiously. Of course voices have been raised to deny
loudly the truth of all the author's statements, and to assert the whole
to be a mere tissue of invention and falsehood. The same charges
have been made against her upon another occasion, and she has lived
to see the truth of her statements, so imputgned, universally admitted.
She awaits with perfect confidence the time when similar justice shall
be rendered to these pages.
But with respect to that division of the subject which it was in-
tenet to bring forward in the latter part of her work, the author's
views have undergone very considerable change. Knowing the immense
amount of evil to be remedied, and the urgent necessity, for many
reasons, that this remedy should not be delayed, it is grievous to see
PREFACE.
misguided and unfortunate men pursuing a course which must necks-
sarily neutralize the efforts of their true friends. When those in whose
behalf she hoped to move the sympathy of their country are found
busy in scenes of courage and lawless violence, and uniting themselves
with individuals whose doctrines are subversive of every species of
social order, the author feels that it would be alike acting in violation
of her own principles, and doing injury to the cause she wishes to
serve, were she to persist in an attempt to hold up as objects of public
sympathy, men who have stained their righteous cause with deeds of
violence and blood. THe author is well aware that many, as well
operatives as their superiors, who were engaged in a virtuous struggle
against the Witness power which oppresses them, deplore the madness
of these ill-advised men as much as herself. But the cause has been
too much sullied, and the sufferers too closely associated in the public
eye with those who have been guilty of all the most deprecated, to
permit her continuing the work as she intended.
Under these circumstances she has determined that the existence of
ler hero as an operative shall close with his childhood. No miseon-
destruction of principles, no misconception of motives can exist with
regard to an attempt to ameliorate the lot of infant labourers. That her
pages may assist in promoting this object is her humble and most
et boe. `The Life and Tenures of Michael Carson''are,
therefore, concluded in the twelfth number.

No traveller can ride or drive within sight of Dowling Lodge,
without being tempted to inquire, : Whose house is that ?
It forms, indeed, a very striking object on the right of the London
road, as the hill rises gradually, and overlooks the town of Ashleigh,
one of the busiest in Lancashire, to the left; for although the trees
about the mansion are not yet of sufficient growth to make it pic-
treasure, its lofty portico, well-proportioned wings, and command-
ing site, render it an ornament to the neighbourhood for miles
round.
Those who are admitted to a nearer view of the house (and, for
the convenience of the public, every Wednesday is set apart for
its being shown), will find still more to admire, than such as see it
only from a distance. It has its park and its winery; conservatories,
which cause the mercury in the thermometer, when paraded through
them, to run up to the cocoa-ripening heat of the tropics., nd ice-
houses that would bring it down again to the temperature of Bering's
traits. It has three drawing-rooms, two dining-rooms, a great
library, all full of new books; as many bedrooms, dressing-rooms,
and boudoirs, as a great man's house ought to have, an a study
besides-Sir Matthew Dowling's own private study. This de-
rightful little apartment is small, not more than twelve feet square;
but nothing can be more agreeable and convenient. lt opens by
one door from the great hall of entrance, and by another comma-
THE LIFE AND CADENcES
nicates through a long stone-passage with the offices of the mansion:
enabling the knight to receive, without interruption, not only is
overlooked (Sir Matthew being the proprietor of many cotton-mills),
but his coaching, gardener, bailifl, and whomever else he might
wish to transact business with.
O the fitting up of this princely mansion, it is only necessary to
say, that it is done in a spirit of relative imitation, which ren-
ders it fully equal, in this respect, to the most finished private
dwellings in Europe. The furniture is uniformly rich throughout:
the picture-frames in the best style of art; saxony carpets in the
drawing-rooms, Turkey ditto in the dining-rooms, brussels in the
bedrooms, and indeed not a single inch of Kidderminster any
where, except in the garrett.
I will not attempt to state the amount of Sir Matthew Dowling's
wealth ; Cocker himself would have found it a laborious task to
make the calculation; and it is sufficient for the gratification of all
reasonable curiosity to say, that throughout the whole line of that
Golconda country, which, being the busiest of the manufacturing
districts, is probably the richest in the world, there was not any one
who could vie in wealth with him. In a world, he shone amidst his
rich neighbours like a golden sun, surrounded by siler moons.
But Sir Matthew was a superior man in all ways. He was six
feet two inches in height, and stout in proportion, with hands and
feet that might have sufficed a giant. His intellectual gifts were
also of no ordinary character. He liked well enough, perhaps, to
stand pre-eminent in the commercial estimation of his neighbours;
but so enlightened was his spirit, that he liked better still to shine be-
for their eyes as a man of taste, a literary and accomplished gentle-
man, a speaker of modern languages, a critical French scholar, a
playful rotary of the muses himself, and a universal Mexicans to all
who wielded a pen in their service. But beyond all else, Sir
Matthew valued himself upon his reputation for the lighter graces of
wit and gallantry: he sought to make himself into something of
a delightful mixture between Killigrew and the Count de Gra-
mont : and there was no receptacle of it from Joe Miller downwards,

the promotion of birth and light-headedness among his fellow-]
creatures; but tragedy and cmely often walk through the]

without difficulty in the career of Sir Matthew Dowling.
The wife of this prosperous gentleman hat also many admirable
qualities. She was not one of the idle gossipers who delight in
chattering about their own concerns to every one who will listen::
she despised such weakness, and had never been heard to hint at
her own parentage, or early history, to any one: rightly considering.

degree at all; but, though a good man, and an excellent clergyman
to boot, he had a strong taste for humour, and had already is-
covered that his neighbour at the great house was rich in more
ways anyone. It was, therefore, with the utmost civility that he
answered,  My degree, Sir Matthew, was that of Master of Arts,''
` And pray, sir, does it give you any title by which you can he
distinguished as in any way a superior sort of person in society ?''
I am afraid not, Sir Matthew,'' was the reply.
1I thank you, sir, for your sincerity,'' rejoined the knight.  It
was important that i should ascertain the truth on this point.--You
are, then, never addressed in company as Mr. Master of Arts, or
any thing of that kind?'
e I. have never yet, Sir matthew, met with any one of sufficient
politeness to do me that honour,'' replied Mr. Hetherington gravely.
`And I suppose you have lived in respectable society?''
Very decent society-very decent, Sir Matthew,'' replied
Hetherington, whose mother was the daughter of a distinguished
nobleman.
Good morning, sir: I shall he happy to see you at Dowling
Lodge-that is to say, sir, if your gown does not lead you to object
to elegantamusements. I love science, MIr. Hetherington, and am
indeed devoted to every thing intellectual; but, notwithstanding
this, I am a worshipper at the shrine of grace and it, and could
not exist among people who did not relish the lighter embellish-
ments of society.''
eI shall be happy, Sir Matthew, to share in your gayer hours,
provided I am fortunate enough to find that you have no objection
to profit by my graver ones,'' replied the clergyman.
Sir Matthew returned from this visit very well pleased with the
new rector. Mlr. Augustus was immediately comforted by a letter,
informing him that he might fall in his accounts, and prepare to
leave the university as soon as he pleased; and, within ten days
after receiving it, the amiable young man was restored to the bosom
of his family.
Next to this primal hope of the Dowling race, came three young
ladies, between the ages of seventeen and twenty-one; the two
eldest of them being as like as two peas, and the third like nothing
on earth hut herself. Then followed several young gentlemen,
who were placed at different fashionable schools; for Sir Matthew,
who was a man of very enlarged mind, declared it to be his opinion
and his principle, that the patronage of such a fortune as his should
be extended as widely as possible. Afer these young gentlemen
came, one after the other, with the interval of about eleven months
between them, ever so many little girls, who, for the present, were
all educated at home, having a particularly clever French governess.
All the rest were nice little children of different degrees of baby-
hood; the dear little girls being remarkable for their long plaited
hair, short frocks, and furhelowed trousers, and the dear little boys
for the manly bustle with which they wore their Scotch sonnets and
plaided tunics, which, considering that neither Sir Matthew nor his
O MICHAEL ARMSTRONG.
lady has ever been in Scotland in their lives, showed great enlarge-
ment of national feeling. Altogether, it was considered to be the
finest family ever seen.
It happened upon a broiliug day about the middle of July, during
e of the hottest summers england had ever known, that sir
Matthew and Lady Dowling `entertained a party of distinguished
fashionable'' at dinner,
It may have been remarked by those.who study such subjects,
that there is a difference between a dinner-party given at such a
grand mansion as that of Sir Matthew Dowling, and one at a dwell-
Pg of perhaps not a quarter the size, where the owners are of a die-
ferent order of the aristocracy, having a longer pedigrees, and a
shorter purse. At hoth, probably,; the banquet will be a costly one,
yet the one entertainment will come of' in a manner as.unlike as
possible to the other. There is something in the usual way of wearing
stiff new-made grandeur, not far unlike that of wearing stiff new-
made clothes. Neither the longer the other sit easily.
At this splendid dinner at Dowling Lodge, the company consisted
of a selection from the neighbouring families, made on the most le-
climate principles of exclusiveness: no family being invited who
did not drive four horses at the races. To this there were indeed
two exceptions. The first was the Right Honourable Lady Clarissa
Sharpton; but this distinguished lady, though she drove only one
pony instead of four horses, was considered by all the country
round as the one thing needful to render a party completely elegant.
She was, indeed, neither young, handsome, nor rich, but she was
Lady Clarissa, and this was enough.
The other exception was to be found in the rotund person of Dr.
Crockley, who having formerly been a celebrated quack, made a
little fortune, and taken out a diploma, had lately married a beauty,
and settled in the town of Ashleigh, where he was well pleased to
pick up a few guinea fees, both as a public evidence of his being a
renal Mi.D., and as a private fund wherewith to indulge his still
very tender passion., by buying fiery for his pretty young wife.
This fat little gentleman was an especial favourite with Sir MIat-
the, chiefly on account of his round humour and ready laugh:;
and also, perhaps, because he had a pleasant way, peculiar to him-
self, of paying compliments in the untested and. most studied
manner possible,
But, notwithstanding the presence of all. these distinguished per-
sons, the dinner moved on very slowly. Sir Matthew, indeed, was
as brilliant as it was possible for any man to be under the circus-
stances, and Lady Clarissa, who did not scruple to declare that she
was very partial to him, - listened to all he said to her with as much
attention at least as any lady could be expected to do, who was
making one of sixteen at a dinner, where there were an equal num-
ber of dishes of hot meats reeking upon the table, and the thermo-
meter standing at 87'. r, Crockley, too, laughed repeatedly:
but his laugh was like a Lucifer match that fails, just killing and
THE LIFE AND ADVERSE
sputtering a little, but going out before it is able to communicate its
light.
The very sight of the servants as they panted round the table,
was quite enough to mother and stifle all inclination for enjoyment
--their shoes created-their faces shone-ice became water-the
salad looked as if it were stewed-the cucumbers seemed to have
fainted away-the prodigious turbot smelt fishy, and its attendant
lobster-sauce glowed not with a deeper tint, than did my LAdy Dow-
ling's cheeks as her nose caught the fragrant gale. In short,
it was a great dinner in the dog-days, and no more need be said of
it.
Great was the inward satisfaction of every guest, when at last
Lady Dowling rose, and gave signal that the party was to be
divided in al. The languid lies welcomed the coolness of the
marble hall as they passed through it, and the gentlemen gazed
eagerly at the butler as he brought forward a fresh supply of claret,
and a reinforcement of ice. But the enjoyment of neither party
lasted long; for any Dowling was too grand and too solemn not
to marshal all her company into her fine drawing-room, where they
were all ceremoniously deposited on satin sofas, amidst swelling
pillows that might have defied the frosts of January; while seven or
eight hot-looking children were commanded to walk around the circle
and kiss every body.
Nor did the gentlemen fare much better; for scarcely had the
drawing-room door closed after the ladies, before the shining and-
head of Dr. Crackley stretched itself up nearly to a level with the
long -backed Sir Matthew's breast-pin, whilst, with a very ominous
sort of growl, making itself heard before his lips opened, he first
prelude, and then uttered the following speech.
1 don't like it, Sir Matthew.-I don't like this business at the
Weavers' Arms.''
 What business, Doctor ?'' replied his fiend sharply.
 VH this meeting, Sir Matthew. I can't get the notion of a strike
out of my head.'' Every chair was drawn towards the little doctor : no-
body had heard a word of it. e Well, gentlemen, perhaps I am is-
taken-perhaps there has been no meeting,'' resumed the friendly
doctor. God knows, I don't wish to spoil the enjoyment of this
delightful hour: but at any rate, my good friends, it is as well for
you to be on the look-out.'' Then lowering his voice, he muttered,
as near to the year of Sir Matthew as he could reach,  I know that
your people are meeting, in doors and out of doors. But you are
such a good, generous, kind-hearted creature, that I dare say we
shall hear, before long, of your having done some d-d good-
natured thing or other, and that perhaps will set all right;: who
know2'
Si Matthew gave an almost imperceptible nod, and pushed on
the claret-jug: but the gaiety of the party had been efectually
checked, and it was not long before the second richest man in com-
any (Sir Matthew of course being the first) said,  Ido think and

o MICHAEL AIITROO.
believe, Sir Matthew, that my lady's caflee would do more to cool
ns than your wine.'' The opinion was not opposed, and, much
earlier than usual, the gentlemen rose, and followed the ladies.
But this movement did not appear greatly to increase the enjoy-
ment of either party. It was near nine o'clock, but the heat con-
tinted to be most oppressive, and the company being for the most
part massive in all ways, their union produced more additional ca-
logic than gaiety. The whole process seemed to have the power of
turning the hours into molten lead as they passed, a portion
of which appeared to drop, and weigh heavily on each individual
heal. In vain Sir Matthew made the circuit of the company,
pausing in front either of the richest or handsomest ladies, as duty
or inclination' preponderance; in vain he uttered his newest puns
and freshest bon-mots-not one of them had strength to laugh,
beyond a little feeble `he, he'' and even that was evidently a
painful effort.
Things were in this state, when Lady Clarissa Sharpton suddenly
rose from the silken couch amidst whose pillows she was in-
bedded, and, without explaining her intentions to my Lady Dowling,
or any one else, darted through the open French-window, and out
;..-
ignorant of the rank of Lady Clarissa, he must from that moment
have felt an innate conviction that she was somebody; for nobody that
was not somebody could have ventured upon so daring an escapade
from such a solemn presence-chamber.' The effect it produced was
electric. Sir Matthew darted across the room with the eagerness of
man of gallantry and gaiety. He piqued himself upon being, of all the
great men in the neighbourhood the one upon whom Lady Clarissa
bestowed the most attention. His estimate of the outward adnan-
tages of his extensive person was indeed not a low one; and, despite
all his lady could do to crush such an odious idea, he was conscious
that he was devoted to the fair sex, and flattered himself that the
fair sex was not ungrateful. In fact, his general manner to ladies
had a good deal of what in female slang is called staining,: but to
Lady Clarissa it was certainly something more. Had she been simply
Miss Sharpton, it is probable that, notwithstanding her great
mental advantages, she would never have been exposed to the
danger of this fascinating distinction, for she was nearly forty years
old, had a sharp nose, and was deplorably thin. But Sir Matthew
was not a man to be insensible to the charm of getting talked of in
the neighbourhood about his devotion to Lady Clarissa any body,
even had she been a skeleton with aGorgon's had. There was,
however, independently of her switching title, a charm in her con-
operation and character, to which the knight was peculiarly sensible
Her ladyship was celebrated for her devotion both to literature and
art; and she permitted all the world to know, for indeed she never
ceased to repeat it, that talent of every kind was to her an object of
idolatry. Now Sir Matthew knew that he was full of talent-poe-
HE LIRE AND ADVANCE
tical talent, pictorial talent, epigramnmatic talent, every kind of talent,
and it was certainly very delightful to be appreciated by such a
superior creature as Lady Clarissa. So strongly indeed did this
intellectual sympathy between them occasionally manifest itself,
that not even the sharp elbows and red-tipped nose of the noble
lady, who, to borrow the phrase of an inimitable described, was in
every sense ``peter-blue perfect,'' could render Lady Dowling
Wie easy respecting the nature of the friendship. Nor was it
without something like a pang that she marked the sudden alacrity
of movement with which Sir Matthew now strode across the floor to
accompany Lady Clarissa in the extraordinary frolic which led her,
in white satin shoes and a gauze dress, to exchange the drawing-
room for the garden, at nine o'clock in the evening.
IT upon this occasion, as upon many others, Lady Dowling
found consolation in the well-known fact, that Lady Clarissa rarely
moved a step without being obsequiously attended by her humble
expansion, Miss Moog. This young lady had been selected to f6ll
her present enviable situation, principally from her appearance,
though she was indeed by no means oid of many other qualified-
tions admirably suited to it. But in appearance she was a striking
contrast to her tall and slender patroness: and, notwithstanding
Lady Clarissa's mental superiority, she was not insensible to the
advantage of having a foil that should set off the charms upon
which she particularly prided herself. Lady Clarissa had a thin,
narrow fast, and an angle that resembled nothing so much as the
leg of a Robin red-breast; the person of Miss Mlogg was supported
on shafts that told her axon origin, and feet that need not have
shrunk from sustaining an ox LAdy Clarissa's slender waist might
have been canceled by a ring of six inches diameter; a cestus of
nearly double the span had often gone nigh to suffocate her plump
companion. The.throat of Lady Clarissa had not only all the flexible
length of the swan's, but might even be said to resemble that of the
stork ia its proportions; while the head of Miss Mlogg was separated
from her shoulders by an interval so trifling, as hardly to be perce-
title tall. The hair of her ladyship, though not very abundant,
was as black as in, and its straight nature enabled her to lay  it in
classic and upon her forehead, furnishing a graceful foundation
for the wreath of oak leaves with which, in judicious imitation of
Domenichino's exquisite head of Sappho, she usually adorned herself
when in full dress: while Miss MIogg, on the contrary, had a bushy
abundance of flaxen curls, which gave round fussy sort of contour
to her face, that could not fail of setting off to advantage the severe
outline of the noble lady; and, in a word, the contrast was alto-

general e found guilty of this scorn towards what is too lowly to
turn, and scorn again, more especially was our knight liable to the
weakness.
As he now hastened to offer his hand to Lady Clarissa in order
to assist her in stepping over the window-sill, he very nearly over-
turned Miss Mogh as he passed her; but heeding neither  the re-
sistance her plump person offered to his passing elbow, nor yet the
timid ohIO' which spoke her alarm, he hurried onward, and,
manfully seizing the hand whose touch was honour, walked to
side by side with the titled lady upon the lawn.

rose and walked towards the window. Three of the most aunt-
less ladies in the party started up to follow her; which, strange as
the manoeuvre appeared to the full-dressed Lady Dowling, she did
not oppose, greatly preferring that the garden party should be
enlarged. But, though not baher, the adventurous fair ones were
stopped before they accomplished their design, by a chorus of re-
monstrances from all the rest of the company, male and female.

one.

``And your blonde dress, Mrs. Simpkins:'' vociferated a fifth;
with a vast deal more in the same strain. So that before the sortie
was accomplished, very lady, save Miss Brotherton, yielded before
the storm of reasons that pelted-them on all sides. The rich young

thousand pounds would not l
Mr. Augustus Dowling,'' said she, still pursuing her way
window-ward, but pausing ere she stepped out, `' will you have
the excessive kindness,--regiment j'ai monte,; but will you have the
charity to look in the hall for my pink satin mantelet, trimmed with
swanson; without it I fear my poor little shoulders will be
across-` too rudely, alas l' with the news of right,''
Now the young lady's shoulders were really very pretty little
shoulders, and, moreover, Mr. Augustus Dowling, notwithstanding
all his elegant nonchalance, perfectly well remembered that she
had twohundred thousand pounds: so, before she had stamped with
her little foot twice, in her impatience to join those who, from thein
gaiety, seemed to be so greatly enjoying the fresh air, he returned
with the mantelet, and having, as usual, adjusted his glass in the
corner of his eye to prevent his making any mistakes, placed it on
her shoulders.
` Now, then :1'' she cried, `` give me your arm. Is not this good
fun ?
The young gentleman obeyed, declaring it was delightful, and in
a moment they were beside Lady Clarissa and Sir Matthew: good
Miss Mlogg keeping a step or two behind.
 Nobody bu your ladyship had it enough to find out that
there was more air to be got out of doors than in,'' said the heiress,
entering the pass her arm through that of her noble friend. But,
upon this occasion, Lady Clarissa, though particularly intimate
with Miss Brotherton, and seldom refusing to use her carriage and
act as her chaperone to all the parties in the neighbourhood, seemed
inclined to check her advances.
Miy dear child,'' said she, I am delighted to see you come
out. I am sure you must have been half stifled, as well as myself.
But you and Mr. Augustus must wander away hy yourselves, and
you may take Moog with you, if you like it, for have just got into
a discussion with Sir Matthew, that I would not break off for the
world. So away with you, my dear, as fast as you can.''
LAdy Clarissa's will was of course law, even to the heiress, but
it was not without a little toss of the head that she turned off to
another walk; nor was it without a considerable struggle between
her inclination and a sense of propriety, which, all things const-
dered, really did her honour, that she permitted poor MIss MIogg
to obey the hint of her patroness, and follow after.
`' And so you really have not seen this gifted young man yet, Sir
Matthew 7'' resumed her ladyship, as soon as they were again alone.
 You have never yet seen this Osmond Normal ?''
No, my lady, I have not,'' replied the knight;` and to say the
truth,'' headed, venturing to press with his stout arm the slender
one that rested on it, `` to say the truth, though I have heard a
monstrous deal about him, I was determined that I would have
nothing to say to him, till I had heard your opinion, my lady,''

How kind1 how flattering, Sir Matthew1 But you will let
me bring him to you now 2''
 I1 I?'' (again processing the lean arm.)  Fancy me saying
no, when you tell me to say yes Ahl my lady, you know better
than that, or I am greatly mistaken.''
 Oh1 Sir Matthew, you are always so kind1 What magnificent
gardens you have1 BY the way, I think I never tasted such a line
as that we had to-day. I assure you, my brother, Lord Highland-
loch, is celebrated for his pines-quite celebrated. They are the
finest in all Scotland, but I give you my honour, I never saw one
equal to it this table.''
Oh1 my lady, that is only your amiable condescension,'' replied
Sir Matthew, greatly touched by this preference.  But if you
really can be so polite as to think the good, I must entreat you
just to let me knock at the head-gardener's door, who lives close
outside this gate. I don't let him live inside, because of his
children, Lady Clarissa. I know what birds peck the worst-ha!
ha ha1 However, yO must just let me pass through the gate t
tell him to put up a brace for your ladyship. They shall be well
taken care of now,my lady, trust me for that; I never valued them
so much before, I promise you.''
`You are too kind a thousand times '' said the lady, stretching
out her own and to open the gate.  I will go with you; there is
nothing I boat upon like visiting a gardener. Could he not take
us into the hot-houses, Sir Matthew? You have no idea how I
could enjoy it.''
By no means displeased to show off the high-born lady upon his
arm, even to the eyes of his gardener, the knight joyfully assented
to the proposal.
Macnab I' he cried, knocking as he passed the cottage-win-
dow,  Macnabl come here directly, and bring a knife and a
basket with you: you must come directly-this very moment, and
unlock the hot-houses-her ladyship wishes to walk through them,
and I must have one or two of the finest pines cut, and packed in a
basket, to be put into Miss Brotherton's carriage: but mind, they
are for Lady Clarissa Sharpton: so you had better give them in
charge to her ladyship's own man.''
Mr. Alexander Macnab promptly left the seeds he was sorting,
and prepared himself, basket in hand, to follow his master. The
knight and the lady left the cottage, arm-and-arm together; but
before they again entered the garden, a fancy seized her lively lady-
ship, that a short ramble in the green lane outside it would be the
most agreeable thing in the world.
`Channel what a poetical idea:'' exclaimed Sir Matthew with
enthusiasm.  There's only one thing,'' he said, stopping short,
``but that will spoil my pleasure altogether: I am so dreadfully afraid
that your ladyship will take hold.''
`Ask the gardener's wife to lend me one of her kerchiefs,'' sail
Lady Clarissa, laughing. But t will only be to satisfy yo, Sis
Matthew, for there is no catching cold in such weather as this.''
1g
THE LIFE AND ADYETDRES
It was with something quite like tender anxiety that the knight
stepped back, asked for and obtained a neat shawl, and himself
wrapped it round the slender person of his amiable companion.
 Thank you thank you a thousand times: But, dear Sir Mat-
they, 1 must not lose my pines by my frolic: will you give the gar-
denver orders to get them without waiting for us? and perhaps a
would let him put up a bunch of grapes, and a few peaches at the
same time-it is no god to let him wait for us, Sir Matthew ;--when
you and I get into a chat together, we shall neither of us think of
the pines again.''
Quitting her highly-valued aristocratic arm for an instant, the
flattered knight ran back and gave the necessary orders: and then,
almost unconscious, in his full contentment, that his own gray head
was as are as that of the oak-crowned nymph by his side, he re-
turned this switching companion and led her gently onward over
the mossy turf that bordered the road.
The gardener and his wife stood together for a moment looking
after them. e Who would think now that she was one of the true
old gentlefolks, and Scotch to boot, to see her pair off that way with
our rogue of a spinner there? How, in God's name, can she choose to
be so free and friendly with such as he?'' said the gardener
 Just for the same reason as yourself, Sawny,'' replied his wife;
 to get all she can out of him.''
' And that's true,'' replied Sawny, setting off upon his business.
I had like to forget the pines, and the grapes, and the peaches.
She's not so far wrong after all; and yet 'is a pity, too.''
The evening was still oppressively sultry, and hardly a breath of
air disturbed either the leaves on the oaks beside the road, or those
that mimicked them so abominably on the lady's brow; but, never-
theless, there was a freshness in the smell of the edges and the grass,
which could not fail to be agreeable to any nerves that had endured
the steaming dinner, and the irksome drawing-room of Dowling
Lodge
The shady lane in which the knight and the lady were thus re-
creating themselves, after skirting the extensive and lofty walls of
the garden, turned at right angles both to the right and the left at
the corner of it. The branch to the left followed the boundary of
the garden, and led to the stable-yard and back entrance to the
house; that to the right conducted to the factory, which was the
source and head-spring of All the wealth that flowed over, and irr-
gate with its fructilying stream, meadows, parks, hot-beds and
lower-gardens, till it made itself a prodigious system in the depths
and heights of Dowling edge.
When the strangely-matched pair came to this point, Sir Matthew
made a halt, till lady Clarissa came to the end of a little poem,
which the protege whom she was so desirous of introducing to her
rich and (to use her own words) `` really very clever friend,'' had in-
scribed in her album.
Nothing could be more agreeable other ladyship than this pause.
oR IIICIIAEL ARMSTRONG.
13
In the first place it was the greatest possible relief to her long6, for
the lines she was reciting were much too full of ice feeling to be
repeated without a painful effort, while walking; and in the second,
the halt, accompanied as it was by a look of earnest attention from
her apparently-delighted companion, furnished the most agreeable
commentary in the world upon the poem itself, as well as on her
manner of reciting it.
It said so plainly, `` tay -move not l-lest a word, an intona-
tion, a cadence, be lost to me:''
Lady Clarissa was really touched by it; and let Sawny the gar-
denver, and his wife Janet, say or think what they would, neither
peaches nor pines had any thing to do with the gratification she at
this moment experienced in the society of the great manufacturer.
Isis eyes were fixed on her face, and she bore the game, and
returned it with that sort of courage and confidence, which genuine
enthusiasm alone can gte
She had just finished a stanza when Sir Matthew ceased to move,
and feeling that he did so under the influence of a spell, which she
well knew would be more powerful still were it spoken when she
were at rest-for Lady Clarissa was aware that she was exceedingly
short-breathed-she repeated the last eight lines in a manner that
showed she felt the pleasure she was producing-a pleasure, as she
thought, like that occasionally caused by the repetition of some
delicious phrase in a musical composition, reiterated as if to all the
soul with its sweetness.
`And should the eye for which I write

Drop on this record of my soul
Which tells a part-ahl not the whole,
Of ones that trembling. filtering. mid,
Now re my cheek. now turn it laid,.-

The tear asked for, almost came as she ceased.
 You feel it, dear Sir matthew'' she said, in a voice of consider-
able emotion.
d hug my chain, and call it dear1''-she again murmurel,
hanging on his arm with such an evident degree of weakness, as
showed the slender form to be less powerful than the ardent spirit
it enshrined.
Let us turn bnaek,'' said Sir Mathew.  My dear friend,''
faint ejaculated any Clarissa, `` you are moved too strongly--
But-no, no: Sir Matthew bElieve me, it were far better for both
of us that we should proceed.-Are we, either of us,. my dear friend,
in a state at thismoment to meet the curious stare of idle eyes--
Come on, dear Sir Matter''-and she gently pulled him forward
as she spoke-`` this sort glade invites us.''
Though perfectly determined to find some excuse for not leading
his fascinating companion within sight of his grim-looking factory,
which another turn in the lane at no great distance would have
made very unpicturesquely visible, it was impossible at that moment

The youngest, but by far the southwest and tallest of the two boys,
instantly obeyed this command, and placing himself midway be-
tween the tormented cow and the fair creature, whose nerves her
menacing attitude had so cruelly shaken, he stood manfully astride
in the middle of the lane, flourished his ragged hat on high, and
with a few lusty `` tough1 wroughT'' repeated at the top of his
yen voice, succeeded in turning the front of the enemy, which
was presently seen to wheel round, and, by a sort of feeble, ambling
little trot, speedily got out of sight round the corner.
 Now, then,'' said Sir Matthew, ``let me leal you home, my dear
lady'
 Not till I have thanked my little dliverer,'' exclaimed Lady
Clarissa, with very sentimental fervour. e Good heaven what
might have been my fate without him t I know-I feel, Sir Matthew,
that you never could have borne to leave me, and what they could
have stopped the fearful approach of that most vicious animal?-
Death, or worse than death-dislocation of limb, disfigurement of
feature: Of, Sir Matthew, your heart, I know, will go side by side
with mine. Tell me, what can I do-what can we both do, to reward
the astonishing bravery of that noble little fellow ?
Depend upon it, my lady, he will be delighted if you will give
him sixpeuce.''
 Sixpence 1'' cried her lalyship, turning extremely red,-but in a
moment she recovered herself and said: `' Oh1 Sir Matthew: do Not
know how dearly you love a jest? Men of witand humour can rarely
be grave for long together, even under circumstances that most keenly
touch their feelings; did I not know you well, my friend, what
should I not think of your proposal But come, come-be serious
for a moment longer : we have, it is true, escaped a tremendous
danger, and it may well make us feel light at heart: but we will not
laugh over it, till we have settled in what way that heroic child
shall receive the need he has earned. I shall not rest in peace, my
friend, unless his destiny be as favorable influenced by me, as
mine has probably been by him. Sir Matthew, you have great
power, enormous wealth, a generous heart, a noble nature, and in-
select, before which, if I mistake not, all difficulties will melt away
like a mist before the sun. Of all this I am quite certain. There
is but one or in the business. Ir you value me, Sir Matthew, as much
as I think you do, that little boy now getting over the game will be
clothed, educated, fed, lodged by you. Do I deceive myself'? or will
the daily sight of him, by renewing the memory of this evening,
rather cause you pleasure than pain ?''
Sir Matthew Dowling clearly saw, that sending ``the little black-.
guard to the deal,'' which was decidedly what his heart whispered
to him, would, at this stage of the business, he inevitably sending
her sentimental ladyship to at least an equal distance from himself;
and this he had no inclination to do. She was the only Lady Some-
body Something in the whole neighbourhood, and he was quite aware
that he had already acquired more envy and hatred among his
friends and neighbours, by the superior degree of intimacy he had
16
TO LIFE AND ADVENTURES
contrived to achieve with her, than by all his successful struggles
to outspend them all.
This pleasure was not to be given up for a trifle, especially at a
moment when it seemed so very clear that it only depended on him-
self to make all the world perceive that they were dearer friends
than ever; so, making a virtue of necessity, he looked in her face
with one of his wittiest smiles, and cleverly taking the cue she had
given, replaced--by 1f you had to found out that I was jesting with
you, LAdy Clarissa, I never, should have believed in your friendship
more: Come here, my boy,'' he continued, raising his loud voice to
a note that must have been heard as far as the factory, ` come here,
1I say.'
The little fellow, on hearing these imperative accents, which were
not quite unknown to him, thought this was the first time he had
been so greatly honoured as to have them addressed to himself,
again let go the hand of his brother, by whose side he had begun to
resume his progress homeward, and once more clambering over
the gatc presented himself, cap in and, before the illustrious
pair.
 You are a happy little boy,'' said Lady Clarissa, ``in having had
the extraordinary good fortune of looking over yonder gate at the
moment you did; and you are a brave little fellow into the bargain
for not running away, as you certainly might have done, when you
saw .that dreadful east. Oh I those tremendous horns, Sir Matthew 1
tley haunt me still  I am quite sure it will be weeks before I lay
my head on my pillow without dreaming of them. But you drop
them away, my death child, and as a reward for it, you shall be com-
formally clothed and fed for the rest of your life. You will like that,
won't you?''
I should very much like never to go to work at the factory any
more,'' replaced the child; ` but, please ma'am,'' he added the minute
after, `I'd sooner you'd clothe and feed Teddy than me. He looked
over the gate first, please ma'am.''
 Did he, my dear7 Then that is another reason why this good
gentleman's favour should be shown to you: for if your brother saw
my distress first, it was on who were the first to believe it,''
:That was only because Teddy is so lame, please ma'am,'' said
the boy.
Lame, is he?'' repeated her lalyship, ' Poor fellow t1 However,
my little man, if I do not greatly mistake, to have this day made
a friend by serving me, who will put you in a situation where, if you
behave well, you will be able to assist all who belong to you.''
The child opened a pair of remarkably large cfcs, and fixing
them on her face, said,  What1 mother and all e'
Yes, I should think so, my dear. IIe is a fine intelligent look-
ing little fellow, is he not, Sir Matthew? But he does not look
healthy. However, I dare say he will improve in that respect.
Plenty of food generally cures all poor people's complaints, par-
circularly when they are young. How old are you, my dear?''
Nine last birthday,'' replied the boy.
oy MICHAEL STRONG.
11
A tall little fellow for his age, though very thin, to be sure.
And what is your name?''
: Michael Armstrong, ma'am.''
Michael Armstrong: Shall not forget it, I assure you: for truly
do I believe that I should have been trampled in the dust by this
time, if you had not been heart-strong as well as Armstrong. And
what shall we do with him at first; Sir Matthew ? Shall we take
him home with us ?'
 WHat: to your cottage, my dear lady 2-Yes, certainly, if it
will give you pleasure.''
My dearest Sir Matthew1 there you are at your jestings
again.''
HaI hal ha1 Lady Clarissa, you begin to know me so well,
that I shall never be able to cut my little dry jokes upon you,'' re-
plied the knight laughing, as it seemed, most heartily, but inwvardly
cursing the audacious exaction of his fair friend, in attempting to
make him pay the enormous price she hinted at, for permitting him
to enjoy the honour and glory of flirting with her. The idea of
being thus entrapped, and forced to adopt `` a bag of rags out of
his own factory'' (for it was thus he inwardly designed little
Michael), called him for a moment so severely, that he was within an
ace of exclaiming, ` Confound to, and the elgar's brat together,
you old fool ?'' Bnt, most fortunatelyfor all parties, held no such
thing: on the contrary, he happily remembered at that critical
moment the important hints he had received from his excellent
friend Dr. Brockley, and instantly decided `'` that this absurd whim
of her ladyship's should be worked up into the d-d good-natured
thing that was to set all right.''
At the very same moment, as if to confirm his resolution, Lady
Clarissa rew from her pocket a cambric pocket-handkerchief,
something the worse for war, perhaps, but most elaborately em-
brokered at each corner with the coronet of a countess, it was
one of a dozen bequeathed to her a few years before by her thrifty
and truly admirable mother, the late Countess of Ilighlandloch.
This coincidence appeared to be the work of Providence.
Give me your arm, my charming friend I'' said the well-satisfied
knight, with an air of tender gallantry, ``and only remember, that
all 1 shall do in this business, will proceed wholly from my devoted
friendship to you. Follow us, little on, and you shall learn what
it is to have served Sir Matthew Dowling's most honoured friend.''
Having said this, he began leading his fair companion back
towards the house as rapidly as might be consistent with the delicate
style in which she was shot.
Please na'am, may I go and tell Teddy?'' said lille Michael,
walking after them.
 elly ?-who is Teddy, my little man?'' inquired ITaly CIa-
issa, graciously smiling upon him; for her ladyship, ato time
an ill-natured woman, was at this moment in the best of all possible
humours with herself, and every body else. There had been.

celebrated for the warmth of his devotion to the fair sex. But for
this, she must not be out of measure blamed, inasmuch as those
who have reached the age for looking on upon the drama of life,
can many of them testify that in this she only yielded to a weak-
ess very unaccountably common to the majority of the sex.
But poor little Michael Armstrong has been left unmercitully
long, looking up inner lalyship's smiling face, as she inquired who
Leidy was.
 Teddy is my brother, please ma'am,'' was his answer.
``Is he still waiting for you at the gate, my dear?'' said the lady.
 I don't see him.''
: He can't stand very well, ma'am, because he is lame,'' replied
Michael.I shouldn't wonder if he was set down, and gone to
sleep.''
Gone to sleep-why it is hardly bedtime yet, my dear, is it
However, I suppose he had hitter go to see, Sir Matthew ?-Your
brother,'' turning again to the child, `' is younger than you are, l
suppose, if he falls asleep on the grass like a baby. Is he old
enough to go home by himself, and tell the great news that has
happened to you ?'
``Caddy is two years older than me-only he is always so tired,''
replied the boy.
 WEll, then, just step back, and bid him run along home by
himself, and tell all the family what a fine act you have done, and
that Sir MAtthew Dowling is going to take care of you all the rest
of your life,''
Michael now, for the first time, ventured to look steadily up into
the face of the majestic Sir Matthew, and his little heart sank with-
in him. It was quite evident from the child's speaking-countenance,
that no pleasurable ideas were suggested, by the assurance that Sir
Matthew would take care of him all the rest of his life. The knight
saw this, and would for a moment have desired no better sport than
wringing his neck round; nevertheless, he patted his head with as-
finishing condescension, and said, ` It is quite true, my boy. For
the sake of this charming lady, ifor whose happiness you must pray
morning, noon, and night, 1 will undertake to provide for yo.
You may step back, if you will, and tell your brother so, who, if he
be two years older than you, will be able to make your friends un-
understand the good fortune that has happened to you,''
I have got no friends, please sir,'' said the hoy.
 Where do you live then 2'
 With mother, sir,''
Is not she your friend, my poor child?'' demanded Lady Clarissa
in an accent of great feeling.
' Please ma'am, she is my mother,'' answered Michael, while a
slight flash mantle his pale cheek, and something like a tear
twinkled in his eye-
How very old'' exclaimed Lady Clarissa. ' Is she not kind
to do, my boy ''
Kind3'' responded Michael, staring at her.

ThE LIFE AND ADv ENTIRE
 Do you love her, my little fellow t''
 Love her?'' again echoed Michael.
 Whatever she is, she has not taught you good manners, my
lad, or you would not answer her lalyship this way,'' said the
knight rather indignantly.
The little boy was certainly very foolish, for, large as his eyes were,
they could not contain the salt rhea which, for no reason in the
world that the lady or gentleman could guess, first filled them and
then ran down in two great big drops upon his cheeks.
1 dare say he is hungry,'' exclaimed Lady Clarissa with sudden
animation.  How delightful, dearest Sir Matthew, to have found
a little creature so greatly in want Are you hungry, my dear?
Tell the truth-don't be afraid.''
 Not very,'' said the child.
 Poor lille fellow l-It is quite evident, Sir Matthew, that he is
exceedingly shy. Let us go back, shall we 2-just as far as the
gate, and give the message ourselves to that lazy fellow that he says
is asleep under the hedge-and two years older than this one.-
Only conceive1-I am delighted that he is not to be the object of
your bounty, for there is nothing so detestable as idleness.''
Sir Matthew had turned in compliance with the word and action,
which expressed her ladyship's desire that he should do so, and in.
another minute they reached the gatc.
 wHere is this brother of yours ?-I don't see him,'' said Lady
Clarissa, looking about.
There he is, a'am, if you please,'' replied Michael, once more
climbing over the gate: and presently he was close under the
flowery hedge, extending his two hands to raise a miserably sick-
looking child, who was, in truth, soundly sleeping there. In con-
sequence of a few words whispered to him by little Michel, the
boy came forward with a shuffling gait, his knees sloping inwards,
and his legs frightfully emaciated: but the moment he reached the
gate, LAdy Clarissa exclaimed,  Good gracious 1 how beautiful I'
It was indeed a closely face that was then turned up to meet her
eye: and when, as if somewhat daunted by her earnest gaze, he
removed his own from her conntenance to that of Sir Matthew, the
bright flash that lighted it up for a moment made it appear more
beautiful still.
And what is your name, my pretty boy ?'' said the lady.
 Edward Armstrong,'' was the reply.
But, my dear child, you don't look well, and you ought not to
go to sleep so, quite late in the evening, upon the grass. What
makes you so very sleepy, my dear? Have you been at play 2
 No, na'am,'' replied the boy, furtively glancing at Sir Matthew,
I have been at work.''
At work1 You can't have done much work, my poor little
fellow, looking as you do.''

off, and I am sure you will be quite chilled if you remain any longer
out of doors.''
I believe you are right, my dear friend,'' said Lady Clarissa,
with a glance of affectionate gratitude for this earnest zeal. ` Let
s go. Never can I forget the kindness you have shown me luring
this eventful walk, and heartless indeed must I be were I to refuse
to acknowledge that it has made a deep impression on me.''
For a moment Lady Clarissa held her coroneted handkerchief to
her eyes, and then resumed, ee Go home, little Edward-tell your
mother, who, by the by, I trust is not harsh to you, that your brother
MIchael is rewarded for an act of bravery that probably saved the
Life of an earl's daughter-has been most generously and nobly

she need have no anxiety whatever on his account. Now, then, Sir
Matthew, I am ready.''
` Are we never to see Michael again ?'' said the game boy, while
a sudden expression of anguish passed across his beautiful features.
e Why not, child ?' replied her ladyship rather sharply.  Do
to suppose that Sir Matthew and I are going to hide him?'
It is all very well then,'' returned Edward, limping away.
:But be sure to go and tell mother all about it yourself to-morrow,
MIle
 Come along, little one'' said LAdy Clarissa, going off.
Follow behind this generous gentleman, and see the palace of a
home which your bravery has won.''
So saying, she moved on; the obsequious knight at her side, and
the wondering Michael Armstrong afer her.
On reaching the gate beside the gardener's house, Sir Matthew
paused. He had been meditating, while seemingly listening in rapt
attention to the lady's talk, on the effect which would be produced
on the party they were about to rejoin, by the appearance of the
ragged little companion they had brought back with them.
Hal he been a ragged sailor-boy, or a ragged plough-boy, or

boy was of all created beings the one least likely to give birth to
such emotions, among his friends and neighbours, or indeed to any
other emotion fit to be exhibited in good society. So, merely saying

dumb by his master saying--

THE LIFE AND ADVENTURES
Observe, Mlacnab, and take care, if you please, that all the servants
about the place know it, that this boy is to be the object of the
greatest benevolence,''
 The greatest-what was you pleased to say, sir?'' said the
Scotch gardener, really and truly doubting his own ears.
BEEoLECE, sirI' shouted the knight vehemently; '` and

affectionately. `` Ah, Sir Matthew1 how few there are who know

 Come along, my man,'' said the Scotsman, leading day
Michael; and he said no more till he was quite sure that the knight
and the lady had got far enough in their progress across the garden,
to be out of hearing, and then he alder: ` And now, my little
fellow, tell me in God's name what all this means  Why, you look
for all the world like one of the little raggamuffins out of the

Michael.

 So, then, you don't understand it much better than I do, it
seems? But what did he say it was for? He didn't take the Earl
of Highlandloch's daughter among the infernal whirligigs, did he,
and pick you out as a specimen to be kept in a glass case ?''
t 1I hope he won't put me in a glass case, sir,'' said Michael, taking
courage from the gardener's good-humour; ``but why he brought me
here at all, I don't very well understand. The lady said it was be

'At any rate, he was making a fun, for he roared like a bull-

and if it brings you food and lodging, I don't suppose you'll break

 Edward out too: Oh1 Lord, oh: Lord, how many more?

various.
Meanwhile Lady Clarissa and the gallant knight re-entered my
Lady Dowling's drawing-room, amidst a perfect storm of questions,
exclamations of admiration, wonder, fears for the lady's safety, and
so forth.
Miss Brotherton, who always took more liberties than any one
else, laughed immoderately; Lady Dowling looked the picture of

usual amiable attention, put a footstool under the lady's misused
white satin shoes, took MIrs. Janet Miacnab's shawl off her shoulders,
and whispered in her enr, that she was dreadfully afraid she must
have caught cold.
BUt Lady Clarissa, with a likely action of both hands at once,
not only drove Miss MInor back, hut every one else who attempted
to crowd round her, saying, ` Give me space give me space, I
entreat you I must have `ample room and verge enough' to
breathe. Such a series of adventures Lady Dowling, you have an
idea 1 Good heaven: I can hardly believe it myself. I have been
in the greatest possible danger of losing my life-a beast-a monster

my race within e. Who ever heard of a Highlandloch being afraid ?
But I give you my honour-I pledge my noble word to you all, that
such a monster as that which I have escaped from this night, might
have made the black Douglas fear''
Or the Earl of Warwick either, perhaps,'' said Miss Brotherton,
for she had heard Sir Matthew utter the word `'` cow,'' in answer to
the importunate inquiries of his eldest son.
 But what shall I say of Sir Matthew Dowling ?'' resumed Lady
Clarissa, with increased energy. `Such benevolence such noble,
disinterestcd conduct :-No, I cannot-I really have no strength left.
Miss Brotherton, my dear, pray do order your carriage: my nerves
are in disorder, so is my dress-in short, I long to get home, and
meditate in solitude on my providential escape.''
Here Lady Clarissa found it necessary to lie down upon a sofa,
her faithful Moog endeavouring in vain to pull her dress over he
slender feet and ankles, for her ladyship was restless, feverish, and
unable to remain in the same attitude for a minute together.
Ere long, however, the carriage of the heiress was announced,
and the languid Lady Clarissa exerted herself to reach it, with the
aid of Miss Moog's substantial arm on one side, and that of Six
Matthew Dowling on the other.

er seat: ` ere long I shall call upon you, and shall hope to see on

we parted from him. Farewell I do assure you I am almost

osEII ARSONs,
WN Mr. MIacnab and his little companion entered the kitchen,
in their way to the servants' hall, to which place of honour the
wondering fcotchman remembered he had been commanded to
conduct his charge, the first person they encountered was Mr.
Simkins, the butler, whom some accidental wish or want had led to
enter a region but rarely honoured by the sunshine of his pre-
since.
Good morning, Macnab. What empty-handed I am afraid
you have forgotten the little basket of peaches I desired to
have; and upon my word, sir, if you leave it much longer, I shall
not consider them worth presenting to the lady for whom I desired
to have them. Be pleased to recollect, good Mr. Sawney, that
when every garden-wall is hung with ripe fruit, a bottle of comfort
will he rather too high a price for a dozen.''
 Your discourse, Mr. Simkins, is neither civil nor discreet in any
way,'' replied the offended North bRiton:  my word, sir, is as good
as the bank, either in England or Scotland; and it is beneath a
gentleman, to say nothing of your rank as a batter, Mr. Simkins,
to suspect that i should forget it,''
 Well, well, the sooner the better, that'sall. But who in God's
name have you got here ?''
 That is more than I am able to tell you, sir,'' replied Macnab.
:All I know about him is a mystery. Sir Matthew, and a lady that
was hardly born to be so free in his company, came to the garden-
house about an hour ago, and Sir MAtthew was as gay as a dark,
and ambled and smirked; while the Ilighlandloch's daughter, old
fool looked as well pleased as if she had been allocated by the
Date of Argyll. WEll, sir, he ordered a basket of the choices
and best for her ladyship, and it went against me, Mr. Simkins,
both ways-for first it ought to choke her, seeing who she is, and
who he is, and next l thought upon my promise to you, sir. IIow-
ever, and nevertheless, Mr. Simkins, I will keep my word with you,
if it cost me a ton of coals more in the forcing.'
' But what's all this to do with your ragged companion there?
The child looks as if he was ready to drop. 1I1 get a bottle you
caught him thieving in the fruit-garden.''
The boy's colour rose on hearing these words. He spoke not, how-
ever,; but his large eyes were turned up to the face of his compa-
union, and the fingers of his little hand pressed the hard palm that
held them, almost convulsiely. Sawney understood the appeal, and
answered it: for though, like many other gentlemen, his code of
oR MIICIHI1KL ArMSTRONG.

honour was at some points a little loosened and enlarged, to fit and
suit his individual circumstances, he felt the value of character as
much as any man; and promptly replied, in good Scotch, which
must, however, for sundry weighty reasons, be here translated into
English : : No, no, Mr. Butler no such thing, I assure you; the
law's as honest as I am, for taught that I know to the contrary. But,
to make a short story of a long one, my lady walked off up the
lane, after borrowing a shawl from my wife, and your master with
her, MIr. Simpkins, who but he-Well, I had picked the fruit, packed
it, and delivered it over to my lady's man, and was just set down
again to my seed-picking, when I heard Sir Matthew's big voice
again halloaing to me, and when I came out, there stood the ill-
sorted pair, arm in arm together, as before, and this ragged chap
beside them.''
Well 1 and what then?'' ejaculated the portly butler, impa-
twenty.  What a long-winded man you are, Macnab.''
 Hoot, man '' retorted Macnab,  if you want the story, to
mst just find patience to hear it. Take this boy to the servants'
hall,' sail Sir Matthew, quite upon the strut, ` and order supper and
a bed for him. 
To the servants' hall?'' repeated the indignant man of bottles,
measuring the little fellow from head to foot with an eye, which,
notwithstanding it was small and bloodshot, was eloquent of scorn.
 To the servants' hall? Sir Matthew will inflict his own company
upon us next, I suppose. Why, look at the cotton fluff mixed with
his hair1 He is neither more nor less than a factory-boy,''
 1to be sure he is,'' replied the gardener, shrugging his soul-
ders, ` but it's no fault of mine, Mr. Simkins; to the servants' hall I
must take him, right or wrong. Come along, hoy.''
``Stop one moment, if you please, Macnab. Let me step to Mrs.
Thompson's room, and speak one word to her about it. Sit down,
sit down, will you, for one moment.'' And away hurried Mr.
Simkins, scattering dismay as he traversed the passages, by uttering
as he passed along to footmen and housemails, abigail and page,
`Go to the kitchen, do, in God's name go and see the company
Sir Matthew has been ordering into the servants' hall .''
And away they flew, one after another, eager to see the wonder;
so that by the time Mr, Simkins himself returned to the kitchen,
marshalling the housekeeper before him, at least half-a-dozen ser-
ants had assembled there, all of whom were gazing at little
Michael, very much as if he had been caught in a forest, and con-
eyed thither to gratify their desire of studying natural history.
 IVo is that dirty little boy, Macnab?'' said the magnificent
Mrs. Thompson, advancing to the spot where the gardener was
seated with his frightened charge standing beside him, and all the
bookers-on making way for her as she passed.
1t is a factory-boy sent here by Sir Matthew, Ms. Thompson,''
replied Macnab, while, forestalling, it may be, the storm likely to
follow the intelligence, he seemed to settle himself in the arm-chair
either to enjoy the fun, or abide the tempest.

of this extraordinary scene, might be punished with as little suffer-
in as possible. Two sprightly housemaids seemed to find some-
thing vastly amusing in the whole business, though their evident
merriment was restrained by the solemnity of Mrs. Thompson's
manner.
t Look up in my face, little boy,'' said the housekeeper, as soon
as she had seated herself and saw that those around her stood still,
as if they had taken their places, and were prepared to listen.
Michael did not move; he was probably ashamed to show that
he was weeping, before the face of a lady who spoke so very
grandly.
The kitchen-maid gave him a nudge, but a gentle one, whisper-
in at the same time-'` Look up, my boy. What be you 'heard of1
There's nobody as wants to hurt you here,''
Thus encouraged, Michael let his arm drop by his side, and his-
covered a face that was indeed allow, and by no means very
plump, but with features and expression which, whatever Sir Mat-
the Dowling's men and maids might think of it, might have sub-
fixed to make the fortune of an able painter.
 WHose child are you?'' demanded the housekeeper. : Mo-
the's,'' replied the boy.

Jennings.
t And I beat no was surprised to hear it, I promise you,'' he
replied.
Mrs. Thompson sighed deeply. :It is dreadful'' said she.
Then, after taking a moment to recover herself, she resumed,'` And
where does the unhappy person live ?''
Please, ma'am, what'' said the puzzled boy.
 The-your mother, child.-Shame upon you for forcing me to
name her1''
MIchael gave a little shake of the head, which seemed to the
merciful kitchen-maid to say, that he did not know what the great
lady meant; but he presently replied, as if discreetly determined to
mind only what he did understand, Mother lives in Iloxley Lane,
ma'am.''
The most deplorable situation in the whole parish inhabited
only by the very lowest 1' observed the housekeeper, with another
indignant sigh.
sO much the worse for she,'' muttered the kitchen-said: but
not loud enough to be heard by her in whose hands rested the
appointment of kitchen-maids as well as cooks.
 And why does such as you come here?'' resumed the house-
keeper.
bECause the squire ordered t'other man to bring me,'' answered
Michael.
I suspect that the boy is a natural fool,'' observed Mrs.
Thompson, addressing the butler.  It is a sure fact, and a great
dispensation-bad parents have almost always children out of

of you,'' she added, looking round her; `` and you will do well to
teach it to your children after you.''
II1 he burnt if I don't think it very likely that it was his own
father sent him here, and no one else,'' said MIr, Jennings, chuckling.
Fie: Jennings, field'' returned Mrs. Thompson, with a frown.
God in heaven only knows what may have been the cause of it.
--Not but what it does look strange, there's no denying that.''
Do you know any thing about your father, child ?' said Mr.,
Simpkins in a magisterial tone.
Fathers in heaven,'' replied the child.
 Mercy on me: do you hear him? Is not that like mocking
the LOrd's prayer?'' exclaimed the lady's-maid.
No, it is not I' said Michael, while a flash of youthful indiana-
tion rushed into his face. : My father is in heaven along with Gao.''
I dare say he means that his father is dead,'' observed the
buler with an air of great sagacity ; ` and if what has been jealous
at is correct,'' he added, winking his eye at Mr. Jennings, '` it is
very natural that he should have been told to say so,''
That's very true,'' said the housekeeper, ``and it may be,
certainly, that the child knows nothing about it whatever, either one
way or t'other-indeed I think it's a good deal the most likely that
he does not;-but, by how, it's a very shocking business, and, as
far as I am concerned, Il1 neither make nor meddle in the
matter.-Of course, the men-servants may do just as they like about
taking notice of him-for here his, and here he will bide, I dare say:
but recommend the maids to follow my example, and not to injure
their characters, nor to corrupt their morals by having any thing to do
with the offspring of---It is more decent not to finish what I was
going to say for yer needs. hung women,-and lucky it is that
there is no need. You must all understand me without it.''
Mrs. Thompson then rose from her chair, and turning her eyes,
and indeed her head, aside, to prevent herself from again seeing
Michael, she walked with a degree of stateless aud majesty that
few housckeepers ever attained, through the kitchen, along the
passage, across the servants' hall, into the sacred shelter of her own
parlour, where she gave way to emotions which rendered a glass of
prime London Madeira absolutely necessary.
Meanwhile Michael remained in no very happy condition in the
kitchen. Ie was very tired, very sleepy, very thirsty, very much
longing to see his mother and brother, and very greatly puzzled
as to himself.
But though accounted to be a brave little fellow for his age, he
could not muster courage enough to ask any questions of those
around him, and if he had, it would have been of no avail; for the
very moment Mrs. Thompson was out of sight, so many of the
servants began talking together, that no sounds his voice could
produce would have been heard.
Jokes and gives about Sir MAtthew, mingled with ridiculous
anecdotes, and very cordial abuse of him and all his race, furnished

2I was a coming., sir, if you hadn't a sent for me,'' rejoined the
overlooked; ' for to say truth, my mind misgives me, that there's
mischief brewing.''
 I have heard as much,'' said the master; e but it can hardly
have gone very far yet, if such a sharp-sighted fellow as you only
suspect.''
tHat's true, sir,'' said the man, with a grim smile, in known-
elements of the compliment;  and 1've not been idle, I promise
you. ut all Know for certain is, that the people, old and young,
ou own people I mean, have, one and all, taken dungeon about that
girl Stephens, that died the week before last, just after leaving the
mill. She had been at work all day in the spinning-mill, and who
was to guess that she was that low 2''
It was a d-d stupid thing though, Parsons, to have a girl go on
working, and not know whether she was dying or not,''
 And how is one to know, sir? I'Il defy any man to find out,
what with their tricks, and what with their real paintings.''
 You won't tell me, Parsons, that if you set your wits to work,
you can't tell whether they are spamming or not ?''
 That's not the question, Sir Matthew, asking your pardon.
There's no great difficulty in finding out whether they are in a real
faint, or only making the most of being a little sticks from stand-
ing, anl want of air. That's not the difficulty. The thing is to
know, when they really take to the downright paintings, whether
they are likely to live through it or not.''
` And where is the great difficulty of that? You know Dr.
Crockley would come at a moment's warning at any time, and feel
their pulses.''
And he does do it, sir. But, in the first place, I doubt if any
man can justly tell whether girls are likely to go on fainting, and
p again, as lots and lots of 'em do for years, or drop down and
die, as Nancy Stephens did. That's one thing; and another is,
that Dr. Crockley is so fond of a joke, that 'is rarely one knows
when he speaks earnest, and when he does not. He did see Nancy
Stephens, about a month ago, and all he said was,` she do look
a litre pale in the gills, to be sure, but a dance would cure her, I
have no doubt.' A dance says l, doctor. And please to tell me,
says lI, how the work is to get on, if the factory boys and girls sets
of dancing?'
 Maybe you haven't got a fiddle1''' said he.
 Maybe I haven't,'' said I.
  Well, then,' says he, ` is it don't suit you to let them dance to
the file, 1'l1 bet ten to one you'll be after making 'em dance to
he strap.' And with that, if youll believe me, sir, he set off caper-
long, and making antics, just as if there had been somebody behind
a-strapping him. To be sure, it was it to make one die of laughing
to see him; but that's not the way you know, sir, to do one any
good as to finding out the real condition of the people.''

Sir Matthew could not resist a hearty laugh at this characteristic
trait of his friend, but he concluded by acknowledging that Parsons
was quite right in saying that this way of doing business was more
agreeable than useful.
However, Parsons,'' he continued, `` we must not talk about
that now, for I have something else to say to you. It is quite plain
that they are getting again to their grumblings: and Crockley,
who you know is up to every thing, says that he'll be his life
they have got some new mischief into their cursed heads.
Now this must be prevented, Parsons, some way or other; for any
harm they can do the machinery, is not the worst of it.-'Tis the
rousing up people's attention again, Parsons, there's the danger.-
Just see what they've done about the blackmoor slaves, by going
on boring for everlasting, ding-dong, ding-dong, till they actually
got the thing done at last. Now the Philadelphy people and the
bOston people are just playing the very same game t'other side the
water: and when they have got their way, where will their national
wealth be I should like to know2-And where will our national
wealth be, when these rascnls have contrived to stop the mills in-
stead of working them 2''
Lord have mercy on us Sir Matthew;-if you don't make
me creep all over to hear your'' exclaimed Parsons.  Is a pity,
sir, and often's the time I have said it, that you aren't in parliament
yourself-you pretty soon show 'em what their meddling with fac-
tories would do for the country,''
S likely I might, Parsons; but a man can't be in two places
at one-and depend upon it, there's good to be done here, if we
knew how to set about it. I shall make you stare, perhaps, Mr.
Parsons, when I tell you what I am about now. It came into my
head by accident at first: but i 1 don't greatly mistake, I'll make
a capital thing of it before i have done.''
 There's no doubt of that. Sir MAtthew, if you sets your mind
to it, let it be what it will,'' replied the confidential overlooked;
' and if it isn't a secret, sir, I should like uncommon much to hear
.
 No, it's no secret, Parsons-any thing in the world but that,''
ellie Sir Matthew, laughing.  What should you say now, Mr.
Superintendent, to my taking a dirty little dog of a picker out of
the factory into my own house, and dressing him, and feeding him,
and lodging him, all for the love of pure benevolence, and little
boys 2''
1don't quite understand you, sir,'' replied Mr, Joseph Parsons,
looking very rare.
 N6, I dare say you don't. But I think I do, Parsons, and
that's more to the purpose. Trust me, than, it will do good if it'
only by giving the people something to talk of just now, besides
this confounded girl's death. And now, my good fellow, tell me all
you know of a boy called Michael Armstrong, for he you must un-
understand, is the hero of my tale.''
That's the boy, is it7-Then that's why the clan didn't come

enough, Sir MAtthew, in course; for the's going on for eight or nine,
and he comes to the factory just about five.''
 And what sort of a boy is he, Parsons?''
 Nothing very particular, Sir Matthew, unless it is because of
the unaccountable fuss he makes about his elder brother, who is
but. a poor rickely, shriveldy sort of a child. For some reason or
other, his bones never seemed to come rightly straight, and this
Mike makes as great a fuss about him, as if he was his grand-
mother,''
Are the parents living '' inquired Sir Matthews.
The mother is., She is a bedridden woman, and ought to be
in the workhouse; but she's upish, and can't abide it, and so she
lies abed, doing plain work and that. and the to boys' wages main-
rains 'em. But I did hear other day, she had given in, and
was a begging to go into the house, and take the eldest boy with her.
These century never know what they would be at. I suspect, how-
someone, that she has got hold of a notion, that because he's so
cripple, he meant to work no more; but I shall take care to see
Butcher, the parish-overseer, about it, It is altogether a trick that,
what won't answer-his fingers is just as able to handle the reels,
and piece the threads as ever they was; and in course, a little dwarf
like him, with his legs like crooked drumsticks, can't look for any
but the youngest wages: so after all, he's one of them as answers
best,''

That woman must not go into the workhouse. The whole thing
shall bo got up, I tell you, in the best possible style. WHat d'to

things sold Z-and we just stepping in at the very nice of time, to

There was something so truly comic in the expression of the
knight's countenance, as he said this, that even the saturnian Mr.
Parsons could not help laughing.
If the born devils don't sing your praises through the country,
in,'' said he, as soon as he had recovered his gravity,  why we must
find some other way to go to work with them,''
Now then be of, Parsons, and contrive some clear scheme or
other to throw the ulappy family into a quandary.''

parted the master and the man.

A LITTLE tASTE GoOssI-A vIsIT OF CHARITY--PnA1CTICAL
BENEVOLENCE.
Tmr promptitude of the measures taken by Mr. Joseph Parsons,
. to bring to effect the wishes of his master, showed him to be de-
serving the post of confidence he held, as principal superintendent
of Sir Matthew Dowling's factory. He lost not a moment in ob-
training a short interview with one of the parish-officers, who was his
particular friend, and then made his way to Huxley-lane, with the
intention of questioning the widowed mother of the two Arm-
strong, as to the situation of her affairs, and the particular species
of misery from which she might, at that precise moment, be suffer-
in the most.
The statement pronounced in Sir Matthew's kitchen respecting
the general eligibility of Ioxley-lane as a place of residence, was
perfectly correct. It was the most deplorable hole in the parish-a
narrow, deep-rutted parish-road (too hopelessly bad to be indicted),
led from the turnpike down a steep hill to the town of Ashleigh.
Exactly at the bottom of the hill, just at the point where every
summer storm and winter torrent deposited their gatherings, there
to remain and he absorbed as they might, began a long, closely-
packed double row of miserable dwellings, crowded to excess by
the population drawn together by the neighbouring factories. There
was a squalid, trimmed look about them all, that spoke fully as
much of want of care, as of want of cash in the authority tribe
who dwelt there. It was like the moral deliuquencies of a corporate
body, of which no man is ashamed, because no man can be pointed
at as the guilty ot. It was not the business of No. 1 to look
after the filth accumulated in front of No. 2; and the inhabitants
of No. 3, saw no use in ending the gate that swung on one hinge,
because No. 4 had no gate at all: and the dogs and the pigs wha
made good their entry there, of course found their way easy
enough through the make-believe hedge, which throughout the
row divided one tenement from another. The very vilest rags were
hanging before most of the doors, as demonstration that washing of
garments was occasionally resorted to within. Crawling infants,
half-starved cats, many cars, and fowls that looked as if each
particular feathecrhad been used as a scavenger's broom, shared the
dust and the sunshine between them, while an odour, which seemed
compounded of a multitude of villanous smells, all reeking tone-
the into one., floated over them, driving the pure untainted air of
heaven aloft, far beyond the reach of any human lungs abiding in
Policy-lane.
Where does widow Armstrong live 2'' demanded Mr. Parsons
of a woman who was whipping a child for tumbling in the dung-
Ill before No. 5.

TRE LIFE AND ADVENTURES5
In the back kitchen of No. 12, please your honour,'' replied
the woman, making a low reverence to the well-known superin-
tencent.
No. 12-why thats Sykes's tenement-and they're on the
ground-floor themselves.''
e Yes, please your honour; but since the rents have been raised
by Sir Matthews, the Sykes's have been obliged to let off the back-
kitchen, and live in the front one.''
e VH there's a matter of a dozen of 'em, isn't there ?''
 Yes, y our honour, they lies terrible close,''
:Obstinate dot-heads:-That's just because they pretend to
fancy that it is not good for the small children to work-I know,
for certain, that they have got two above five years, that they won't
send to the factory; and then they have the outdaciousness to con-
plain that the rents are raised-as if because they are above choosing
to earn money in an honest way, Sir Matthew was not to make what
he could of hisown. 'Tis disgusting to see such airs, where people
ought to be thankful and happy to get work,''
That's quite true, no doubt, sir,'' answered the woman, con-
tinuing to shake, and occasionally to slap the grub of a child she
had taken off' the dunghill.  But obert Sykes's children are
very weakly: and them as your honour talks of, is almost too small
--though 'isn't to be doubted that it is the bounded duty of us all
to send 'em, sooner than see 'em starve,''
.I fancy so, indeed,'' replied Mr. Parsons; adding, with a finger
pointed at the squalling child, who still continued under the cleans-
ing process above described, ``And isn't it a comfort now, Mrs.
Miller, to get rid of the plague of 'em7''
The woman ceased to shake her little boy, and looking for a mo-
ment at the clear blue eyes that, notwithstanding her rough disc-
pline, were very lovingly turned up to her face-something like a
shudder passed over her.
Get along in with you, Bill,'' said she, as if afraid that the
blighting glance of the superintendent should rest upon him; and
then added, `` as long as they re so very small, your honour, they
can't do no good if they be sent.''
 Stuff and nonsense? there's ways to teach'em. But don't
fancy that I want you to send your brats-confound'men: They're
the greatest plagues in nature: and nothing on God's earth but
good-headedness and love of his country would ever make Sir
Matthew, for one, trouble himself or his men with any of the century.
--No. 12, is it, where 1 shall find the widow Armstrong 3''
Yes, please your honour-you'll be sure to find her. She's a
cripple pour soul, and can't stir,''
She's made up her mind to go into the workhouse, hasn't she ''
demanded the manager.
Have she indeed, poor thing ?'' responded the woman, in an
accent of compassion.
I heard so, as I come along, and that's the reason I'm going to
her. Our gooi Sir Matthew, who to be sure is the kindest-hearted
o DIViNE ARMSTRONG.

man in the whole world, has taken a fancy to her boy, and he'll be
 father to him, In a bound to say to will; and that why 1 think
he like me to give her a call, just to tell her not to fret herself
bout the workhouse. If she don`'t like going the, she needn't, I
dare say, with such a good friend as she's got.''
THe woman stared at him with an air of such genuine astonishi-
meant, that the superintendent felt disconcerted, and turning abruptly
away, continued his progress down the land.
By the time he had reached No. 12, however, he had begun to
doubt whether his sudden appearance at the bedside of the widow
Armstrong might not produce an effect unfavorable to the object
he had in view.
`As sure as steam's steam,'' thought he, t she'll be more
inclined to fancy that i1 am come scolding about the boys for some-
thing, than to take her part, or do her pleasure; so i'll just say a civil
word to the Systems, and then stroll away on, till such time as the
parish officers have been after her. Ill engage for it, that Sam
Butcher won't let no gross grow under his feet after what I said to
him; and if I turn in when he's there, as if t see what was going
on, it would certainly be more natural-like, and believable.''
In accordance with this improved projetf de chari, MIr. Joseph
Parsons walked on; but he had not proceeded far are, on turning
his head round to reconnoitre, he perceived, not the tall and burly
sAm Butcher, the overseer of the parish, but the lean and cathy
person of little Michael, advancing with an eager and rapid ste
towards his mother's dwelling-
Shot' ejaculated the sagacious Parsons, `` herc comes the
charity jobI It would be worth a week s wages to hear him tell his
own story.''
Mr. Joseph Parsons had a Napoleon-like promptitude of action,
which the unlcarned operatic described by calling him `` a word-
and-a-blow man,'' but which in reality often deserved the higher
epithet above bestowed.
Scarcely had the thought of oerhcaring little Michael's talc sun-
tested itself, are a lifelong movement ensconced him for a moment
behind a favouring ig-say, from whence, unseen, he watch the
boy enter the door of No. 12.
Again Napoleon-like, he remembered all he had heard from her
neighbour, concerning the position of the widow's dwelling-place:
and rightly judging that Sykes back-kitchen mst., in some way
or other, be in a condition to favor the emission of sound, he
troubled not the household by making his approaches through the
principal entrance, but striding over the inefficient fence of the tiny
cabbage-plot behind, obtained a station as favourable to his pur-
post, as he could possibly desire. `1his was a nook between a pro-
tolerance intended for an open, and the window close beside the
widow Armstrong's bed, from'whence prophetic fate, favouring the
yet latent purpose of the manager, had caused three panes to be ex-
traced by a volley of pebbles, intended for mother ykses's cat, at
least two months before.
38
THE LIFE AND ADVENTURES
To this safe and commodious crouching-place, he made his way
just in time to hear the widow say, `' Understand one word of
Edward's story, Like; so sit down dear hoy, and tell me all.''
Why mother, 'is like a story-book-and it's very fine to be sure
-but yet--'' And the boy stopped short.
ut yet you don't like it, Mike?'' rejoined his mother.
 That's what you, was going to say. Tell the truth, my child,
and don't go to keep nothing from me.''
That was it,'' said Mike.
Ungrateful viper?'' muttered the confidential superintendent
between his closed teeth.
Poor fellow: poor dear Michael1'' exclaimed the woman,
soothingly.  It was hard to go to sleep without kissing mother,
wasn't i?
Yes, I didn't like that-nor I didn't like being without Teddy
neither-and I don't like the grumpy old lady as come into the
kitchen, and abused me: for the gentlemen servants either, except
the gardener, and he took hold of my hand, and led me along kind
enough-and I like Molly too, that's she as give me my supper and
my bed, and my breakfast this morning, mother. Oh, mothers
how I did long to bring away some of the milk and bread and
butter home with me1''
 Neer think of such a thing, for your life, boy 1'' exclaimed the
mother eagerly.  Would be thieving, nothing else, Michael-
nothing more or less than thieving-never mention that again to
me, dear, that's a darling.''
I won't, mother; but I know I shall think of it every time I see
them big pounds of butter, and jugs of milk, and minds how care-
ful yon be over your little scrimped bit in the broken saucer, and
how you drinks your drop of tea without ever having any milk at
all
 Never you mind that, darling. But what are they going to do
with you, Mike? And what for do they want to have you up at
the great house Is a mystery to me, and thankful as we ought
to be for any help, I can't say but I should be easier in my mind,
if I understood something about it.''
Impcrtineut hag'' growled the surly Parsons from his lair.
Does she think they are going to trap him like a rabbit, for the
sake of his skin 2'
But, mother, I don't understand any thing about it myself,'
sail Michael, rather hopefully.
To this vocal, no reply was made for some minutes; upon
which the superintendent grew impatient, and stretching forward
his neck a little, contrived thwart the sheltering branches of an
elder-bush, to peep through the broken window.
To the agent or sir Matthew Dowling's benevolence the sight that
presented itself was really rerolting: though there may be others
who would have been affected differently by it. Michael had flung
himself across the bcd; his arms were thrown round his mother, who
was sitting upright with some piece of needlework in her hands,
or IICIIAEL ARTURO.
39
and his dark curls set off in strong contrast the extreme paleness of
the face that looked down upon him. The widow Armstrong was
still rather a young woman, and would still have been a very lovely
one, had not sickness and poor living sharpened the delicate fea-
turns, and destroyed the oval outline that nature had made perfect.
Yet she had quite enough of beauty left to detain the eye: and
such a history of patient suffering might be read in every line of her
speaking countenance, that few ever looked upon her harshly.
Spite of her extreme poverty too, she was clean-her cap was clean,
thc bedclothes were clean, and the pale hands too, looked so very
white, that if Mr. Parsons from his hiding-place had ventured to
speak any opinion concerning her, he would certainlyhave given utter-
ance to a strong expression of indignation, at the abominable air of
delicacy which her appearance displayed.
She looked as if she were struggling with some painful feeling,
but did not weep, though her boy did, heartily.
For a little while she suffered his tears to low without interrupt-
tion or reproof, and then she kissed him once, twice, thrice.
There now, MIchael,'' she said, looking at him fondly; ` have
you not played baby long enough Stand up, darling, and listen
to me. You don't seem over-glad, MIike, of this great change, and
if you did, perhaps I might have been over-sorry;  but sorrow
would be in for either of us, when God has sent us help. `Tis you
that be the earliest Mike, and 'is you that want food the most.
growing at the rate you do, and heart-sore have I been at meal-
times to see you so stinted. So never let us trouble ourselves
any more about the reasons for your getting so into favour, but
just thank God, and be contented.''
 But mother1 Who will you get on without me ?'' replied
michael, shaking his head; I am sure that Teddy can't make
your bed as I do-he hasn't the strength in his arms. And who's
to fetch water2 'Deed and 'deed mother, you'd better thank Sir
MAtthew, and say no, unless he'll just please to let Teddy go
instead.''
That won't do my dear child, in any way. 'The I must watch
poor Elwvard. Little as I can do for him, I don't think he'd like to
part from me, as long as God is pleased to let me stay.''
 That's true mother-that's very true Teddy would break his
heart. No, no, 'isn't he shall be parted from you; Ill show him
how to make the bed, if I can't come oer myself; but perhaps
they let me, mother2''
i that's the business that you'll have to do, Michael ?'' inquired
the widow.
I haven't been told of any business yet,'' replied the boy.
 But you don't expect that you're going to be kept for nothing,
dear ' said the mother, smiling.
`Tin't for my work, mother ; 'is for the cow,'' replied Michael,
gravely.
 The cow, child ? WHaT is it you and Ted have got into your
heads about a cow? A poor starved beast, he says it was, that
40
TIL LIFE AND DEBATES
wouldn't have frightened a mouse, and you made it turn round,
MIike-that's all I can make out. But he must be mistaken
surely. Wha wes it you did about the cow, darling?''
At this question, the boy burst into a hearty fit of laughter,
which to say truth. offended the listening ears of MIr. Joseph Par-
sons, still more than his weeping had done.
1Il do his business for him, he may deped upon it,'' thought
he. `` If master must have a charity job, he must; but it don't to-
low that the cretur shan't be made to know himself just as well as if
he was in the factory. I'll be your overlooked yet, master ike,''
Just as this prophetic sketching of the future had made itself
distinctly visible to his mind's eye, the bodily senses of the agent
announced to him that the tranquil tete-a-tete within the widow's
chamber was disturbed by the entrance of persons, whose voice and
step announced that they were men. MIr. Parsons was at no loss
to guess their errand.  Here they come:'' muttered he. ` Now
we'll see how Master Butcher manages his job.
:We be combed to see,'' said a gruff voice within the widow's
chamber, `` whether or no you be combed to your senses, WMIrs.
Armstrong.''
 Sir2'' said the trembling woman in return.
 You knows well enough what l means, without my going into
it again: you knows well enough as IT comes to talk to be about
the houseagain. Were had Larkins the baker, coming to inquire
if there's parish pay to look to, for your bill, MIrs. Armstrong-and
I have told lim, re,not a farting, not the quarter of a fartling.
unless you'll come into the house. The parish have gone on allow-
ing you two shilling a week, week after week, Gol knows how long
--'is a perfect shame and imposition, and the board says they won't
do it no longer. On and the boys too may come in if you will.
that's one thing: but living here, cramming 'cm with as much
wheaten bread as they'll et without paying for it, is another, and
it's what no honest parish don't tolerate. I'll be bound to say now,
as you have brought up the camps without their ever knowing the
taste of gruel? Tell the truth, did you ever take the trouble to
make a drop of gruel for 'cm''
`` As long as I had my legs to stand upon, sir, I never minded
trouble; and, when my husband was living, we did a deal better,
and 1 have one cooking for 'em then, such as a few potatoes and a
cabbage, may be, with a scrap of bacon on a Sunday: but, from
the hour he died, we have never had a pot upon the fire.''
 That's what 'is to be so obstinate. If you'd come into the
house you'd see the pot upon the fire all day long, most.''
:bUt the children would be in one room, after they came from
the factory, and I should be in another,'' pleaded the widow, `` and
l've got a few of the decent things as I married with, when I came
from service, and it would be a grief to me to seo 'em all sold,''
IN the parish don't sell 'em, ILarkins the baker will, you may
take my word for that, Mrs. Armstrong,'' replied the overseer.

able man, as is ready to take all you've got at a variation, fair and
honourable, but that's just as you please. I onlycalled, as in duty
bound, to tell me that the parish don't mean to conti no such ex-
travraganee as paying you two shilling a week, no longer.''
God help me'' answered the widow getty.  I 'is his ill
that so it should be, it would be a sin for me to complain.''
That's vastly fine, meant it?'' said the brutal Butcher, `` and
now lets hear what you'll be after saying to bMlaster Larkins, for
here he comes, as: sure as eggs be eggs.''.
An abrupt, and most peremptory demand,. for three, pounds two
shillings and seven pence, was here made, by a sour-lookinglittle
man, who entered the small room without ceremony, making a grOup
of intruders round the widows bed, equally unwanted and unwelcome.
Her over-taxed courage seemed to fail, for it was with something
like a so that she replied to his demand by saying, `I shall hae
twelve shillings to take for needlework, when this is done, and you
shall have it every farthing sir, if you'll be so merciful''
 And who's to pay your rent, Misses Armstrong ? if I may be
so bold,'' said MIr. Tuchel.
The - widow had not a word to say for herself, and, covering her
face with her hands, wept bitterly..
Now's my time l'' said Parsons to himself, as he stealthily crept
from his hiding-place.  Now for Sir Matthew's benevolence.'' And,
in a minute afterwards, his tall, gaunt figure, and hard county-
ance, were added to the company. The noise he made in entering,
caused the widow to uncover her eyes, ahn it was with an emotion
little short of terror that she recognised the tyrant, at whose name
her childrens cheeks grew pale.  Instinctively she stretched out
her hand, and took hold of that of, Michael, who was still seated
on the side of the be. But the boy shook it off, as if his mother's
love was a secret treasure that, the overlooked must not see, and,
suddenly standing up, he remained, with his eyes fixed on the
ground,and his human hanging by his sides, as if petrified.
 Ilollo l-why what's the matter now? Is all the parish.come,to
wish joy to this good woman .here?'' sail the overlooked, with as
around an air as he could persuade his iron features.to assume.
 WIsh her joy ?' responded the well-tutored parish-officer, ` and
for wsht, Mr. Parsons, if you please? For having an honest
tradesman come upon her with the gripe of the law, in hopes to get
what's his own? She's got into trouble, I promise you, and I don't
very well see how she's to get out of it.''
 You don't say so:'' said the confidential agent. What. is7'.
that yon, Mlr. Larkins, coming to take the law of a poor body this
way I didn't think you was so harl-hearted.''
I don't deserve that character, sir,'' replied the baker sharply:
for though desire to call and enforce his claim by the parish
overseer, Ir. Larkins knew not a word about Sir MAtthew's scheme
of benevolence; ` and the proof' that my heart isn't harder than
other people's'' he continued, ' is, that i have the widow here
42
THE LIFE AND ADVENTURES
credit for what has been, excepting a few ounces of tea, her whole
and sole living for months past.''
And very kind of ye too,'' observed the conciliating superin-
tencent.
I should like to know, then, what became of all the money
the two boys got, besides her own needlework, and, of late, two
shilling a week from the parish, beside?'' observed Mr. Butcher.
 WHy, that is rather puzzling. I must say,'' replied Mr. Parsons,
" but no matter for that, no matter for that, just now. The family
have got a kind friend, I promise you.''
Yes, but it does matter,'' returned Larkins.  It can't be right,
to how, for me to be out of three pounds two shillings and seven
pence, and she with seh lots of money.''
 Indeed, indeed, sir'' said the widow, once more looking up at
it, I have done my very best, paying a little and a little atas
time, as you know I never stopped doing, only for two weeks that
my biggest-that is my oldest boy, was making up time that was
lost, when he was home sick, and so got no wages. But the seven
shillings a week that they get between 'me, and my uncertain bit of
needle-work, gentlemen, can't stand for food, and clothes, and
rent'-and a little soap to keep us decent, and a bit of firing to
boil a drop of water-it can't do all that, gentlemen, without
getting behindhand, when any making up time comes in the
factory.'
s All then, that's just the reason why you must come into the
house,'' replied Butcher; ``and, at any rate, you may depend upon
getting no more money out of it,'
Upon hearing these words, ``the decent, respectable man,'' who
was willing to take the widow's goods, at a  variation fair and
honourable,'' began examining the condition of a chair that stood
near him; an operation which the widow eyed with the most tenuous
look imaginable.
: Come into the house, I tell you, without more ado,'' resumed
Butcher. ``And what, in God's name, d'ye think we want you in for
but your own good? D'ye think the parish have a fancy for main-
training crippled women and children, by way of a pleasure? 'Ts
ruination any way; but when your in, we know the worst of it at
once, and that's something. The boys' wages will go a bit to help,
and at any rate there'll be no two shillings to pay, which is what
the overseer hates above all things; and what they won't continy to
do. So now i have said my say.''
And here MIr. Butcher began to move his heavy person towards
the door.
Stop a minute, MIr. Butcher, if you please sir,'' ejaculatet Sir
Matthew's superintendent. ` I should be sorry to let you go back
to your employers under any delusion or mistake whatever, and the
fact is, that this good woman, the widow Armstrong, is no more
likely to go another workhouse than you are yourself, Mlr. luther;
begging your pardon for naming such a thing.''
or rtctrEL ARMSTRONG.
43
Then I suppose as it's yourself as means to keep her out of it,
Mr. Parsons'' replied the paris officer closely.
 Not exactly me, myself,'' replied the other in the same tone,
but it's one as much more able as he is willing. It is Sir Matthew
Dowling as intends to befriend her, and that not only on account of
the general charitableness of his temper, which all who know him
really well are quite aware is very great, but because that little boy
as stands there, and who is one of our factory children, saved a
friend of any Dowling's, last night, from something she looked
on to be a considerable danger.''
`And does Sir Matthew mean to see me paid ?'' demanded the
baker.
Upon my word, Mr. Larkin, that's more than what I'e got
authority to say,'' replied Parsons; `` but, whomsoever, I don't
think that you had best go on, just at this particular minute, to
execute about it, seeing that in course Sir Matthew won't take it
civil, when he's being such a friend himself, to the widow.''
I don't want to do nothing uncivil to nobody,'' replied th
baker, `` but I don't quite understand this business. It is some-
thing new, isn't it, Sir Matthew setting up for a soft-hearted gentle-
man, among the factory folks?'
Now to you, may be, Mr. Larkin, but not to me,'' replied the
trustworthy agent. : There isn't another to be found, look which
way you will, that can be compared with Sir Mathew Dowling, for
real, true, benevolent, charitableness, when he finds proper objects
for it.''
The baker stared; the man of old chairs and tables scratched
his puzzled heal; the intelligent Mr. Butcher looked at the speaker
with a knowing wink; the widow fixed her eyes upon her patchwork
quilt: and little Michael in astonishment, which conquered terror,
raised his eyes to the superintendent's face, while that worthy ado-
case of a master's virtues stood firmly, striking his stout cane upon
the ground, with the air of a man ready to do battle with all the
world in support of what he has asserted.
 Well then, at any rate my business is done and ended,'' said
Mr. Tuchel moving off, `` and I wish you joy Muslims Armstrong of
your unaccountable good fortune.''
 Come along, Jim I'' said the baker to the respectable dealer in
seized goods, `` there's nothing to be done to-day, that's clear. Dut
I hope you'll remember the twelve shillings as you've promised me,
MIrs. Armstrong.''
I ill indeed, sir I' answered the widow cnarnesly; and, on
receiving this assurance, Mr. Larkin took his departure with his
professional friend, leaving Mr. Joseph Parsons, the widow Arm-
strong, and her son Michael to carry on whatever conversation they
might wish for, without interruption.
WEll now, if I,ain't glad they're gone, them fellows,'' said
the superintendent shutting the door aftermath. You are a
favoured woman, Mars. Armstrong, to get rid of me as you have
44
THE LIFE AND ADVENTURES
done, and I don't and won't, question that you are thankful to those
to whom thanks are due,''
 I always wish to be so, sir,'' said the widow.
 WEll, there's no hardship in that I suppose. But about this
son of yours, this young MAster MIchael, you must see to his doing
his duty to his benefactor. If he was to prove ungrateful, 3Irs.
Armstrong, it is but fair to tell you that I wouldn't undertake to
answer for the consequences.''
God forbid hc ever should be ungrateful to and as was kind to
him I'' replied the poor woman; `but indeed, sir, I don't think it is
in his heart to be so. Since the day he was born, God bless him,
Ihae had little besides love to give him, and indeed, sir, I think the
child would die for me.''
MIchael silly stole his little hand sideways under the head-
clothes, where it was soon clasped in that of his mother, but his
eyes were again firmly riveted upon the ground.
`Ay, at, that's, all very well; but it has nothing to do in any
way with his duty and obligations to Sir Matthew. What I want
to know is, whether he is ready and willing to do that which Is
MAtthew will require of him--that's the main question, you see,
Mrs. Armstrong.''
And what will that be, sir ?'' said the widow, while Michael's
eyes were again raised for a moment to the face of his taskmaster.
hE is to be made a gentleman of-that's to be the first work
put upon him.'' The poor woman smiled ; but little Michael shook
his head. The superintendent appeared to pay no attention to
either; but again striking his cane magisterially upon the ground,
he added, ` Let him make up his mind to do all that he's bid, and
come back to Dowling Lodge it as little delay as possible.''
WIth these words, and without deciding to bestow any species of
parting salutation upon those to whom they were addressed, Mr.
Parsons left the room.

WInE the superintendent, in his serpentine course homcward,
scattered the timings of his master's mnificence towards the factory-
boy, michael Armstrong and his mother indulged themselves in a
few parting words and very tender caresses: the mother continuing
to repeat at intervals, ` Be sure, darling, to be a good boy, and do
what you're bid,'' while the son reiterated his entreaties that she

and Teddy would take care one of other, and have him back
again, spite of every thing, if they found that they could not do so
well without him.
But even hill this went on, Michael was improving lis toilet by
putting on the more carefully patched garments, which had hitherto
been kept saved for sundays. When this operation was completed,
and his hair, face, and hands made as clean as the joint efforts of
himself and his mother could contrive to make them, the little boy
turned to leave the miserable shed that had been his home, with re-
reluctant step and heavy heart, retracing the short distance between his
mother's bid and the door, once and again to take another kiss, and
to repeat, with increased carnestness, the questions, "` In't there
nothing more i can do for you, mother, before I go away ?-and
will you be sure to tell Teddy to stop for me, morning and night,
at the gate in the lane, where it all happened ?-will on mother ?''
BUt at length the lingering separation was completed, and
Michael sct off upon his return to Dowling Lodge. In the mean
time, Sir Matthew himself had not been idle: but, retiring to his
study, he composed a paragraph for the county newspaper, which,
after considerable study and repeated corrections, was at length
completed, and despatched by the post, in a feigned hand, the wax
being stamped with the handle of the seal instead of his arms, and
the postage paid.
The paragraph ran thus:
xGLISII EXEVoLEMCH.
 There is, perhaps, no class of men so cruelly misrepresented
as the manufacturers of Great Britain; surrounded on all sides by
a population of labourers, crowded together exactly in proportion
to the quantity of work the neighbouring factories are able to fur-
nish-they are continually reproached both with giving too many
hours of employment to their poor neighbours on the one hand, and
with the poverty which is the inevitable lot of operatives with large
families on the other.
That all manufacturers, however, are not the cruel mercenary
tyrants they are so often, and so unjustly described to be, was
shown within the last few days by an incident which occurred near
the town of Ashleigh, not a hundred miles from D-l-g L-d-e.
The owner of that splendid mansion, while escorting the amiable
Lady -- round his grounds, had occasion to remark some
symptoms of a very noble disposition in one of the children be-
longing to a neighbouring factory on his estate. On making in-
prices, he discovered him to be the son of a poor widow, whose
failing health made her, and her orphan children peculiarly eligible
as objects of charity. This fact having been satisfactorily acer-
gained, Sir M--th--w D-l-g gave way to the warm impulses of
his generous heart, and adopting thc lille orphan among his own
children, at once gratified tie gentle feelings of his amiable nature,
and set them an example which it is impossible they should ever
forget. It is more easy for the recorder of this charming anecdote
46
THE LIFE AND ADVENTURES
to relate thus the principal circumstances of it, than to enter into
any detail of the numberless delicate traits of character exhibited
by Sir M. D-l-g in the course of the transaction. Those who
know him thoroughly, will, however, be at no loss how to supply
these: and those who do not, would scarcely understand the de-
scription, were it given with all the detail possible,''
The value and the accuracy of the statements contained in this
announcement, belonged wholly to the author of it; the phrase-
logy to a private MlS. digest of newspaper eloquence, the result of
many years of steady research, during which no morsel of fine writ-
ing that might assist in such occasional addresses to the public as
the present, had been eer suffered to flow down the stream of time,
and perish, without having been first carefully noted in the knight's
repertory of fine periods.
Having concluded this business, Sir MAtthew Dowling rang his
bell. As it was only the study-bill, it was answered, as usual, by
one of the housemaids.
Where is the little boy, my dear, that I sent into the servants'
hall last night ?'' inquircd Sir Matthew.
Upon my word, Sir Matthew, I can't tell,'' she replied; adding,
in that one of familiar confidence which her master's condescension
encouraged, `but if you sent him into the hall, Sir Matthew,
he never got there, nor never will, you may take my word for that,
as long as Madam Thompson reigns.'
Thc housemaid want a beatty-none such, as was before stated,
ever made part of Lady Dowling's household; but she was a bit,
and Sir Matthew was too clever himself not to feel the value of
cleverness in others: he, therefore, raised his eyebrows in a comic
grace, very good-humoured chuckle the maid under her ugly
chin, and instead of putting himself in a rage, as might have
happened under other circumstances, he only said, ' And how was
that my dear? Come, telling all about it-I like your stories,
Peggy, they are always so funny.''
 WHose stories wouldn't he funny, Sir MAtthew, if they told of
the air and graces of Mother Thompson 1'' replied the likely dam-
sel; `' she's for all the world like an old owl, as sits winking his
eyes and trying to look wise.''
 Bent the's a prime favourite with my lady, Peggy, and into the
bargain, knows a thing or two about soups and hashes; so we
must be very respectful, my dear, in talking of her-but as to her
daring to say, that the boy I ordered into the hall was to be turned
out of it, that's rather more than possible, I think,''
 That's because you don't know Mirs. Thompson, Sir Matthew.
I only wish you had heard and seen 'cm last night, she, and the

Sir MAtthew; but still without losing his good humour.  How-

ever, all people of fashion, that is, rich people, Peggy, always do
have a confounded pertinent set of servants about 'em. That's
one of the great differences between high people and so,''
To be sure you must know best, Sir Matthew,'' replied the
saucy resettle, hut with a look and accent somewhat ironic.
don't mean to doubt that in the least, i'm sure; but in the places
I'se lived at-Lord Wilmot's, Lord Crampto's, and such link, I
never did hear of my lord's commands being treated in that fashion.
They might have their jokes in the hall, and the housekeeper's
room to, no doubt of it, and impudent enough if you like it;
but for downright flat disobedience, I never did hear of such a
thing.''
Sir Matthew on hearing this, became rather white about the lips,
and red about the forehead; but Peggy knew the rising storm was
not at all Likely to fall on her, so nothing daunted, she went on.
I don't think I should have taken much notice about it, Sir
Matthew, if it hadn't been for not liking to see you treated with his-
respect; for 1m not over and above partial to beggar children my-
self; but that sort of natural dislike was nothing in comparison to
my feelings about you, sir: and if I had been placed in power, in-
stead of having none, your will would have been obeyed, if every
servant in the house had flowed at me for it.''
 You're an excellent girl, Peggy,'' replied the knight, approach-
ing hor very condescendingly. You know all enough that you
are a favourite, and I know well enough, my dear, that you deserve
to be so: and I tell you what, Peggy, I'll take care to let those
animals, my servants, know that I am master here, as well as in the
factory--and that my word's law1''
And so it ought to be, Sir Matthew,'' replied the obedient do-
mystic.  I hope I know my duty to will to dispute my master's
will in any thing;'' and as she spoke she very meekly yielded her-
self to receive the condescending salute, with which Sir Matthew
was pleased to reward her excellent sentiments.
You are an excellent good girl, Peggy1'' he resumed after this
little interruption ; ``and don't fear but I shall find means to reward
you. But you must give me your help, my dear, to confound the
importinence of these fellow-servants of yours; if I don't make 'em
wait upon that beggar's brat as if he was their lord and master,never
trust me with a kiss more. Where is the little factory vermin,

said and the fat cook; but what's come of him since, i am no
ways able to say.''
On hearing this, Sir Matthew raised his hand towards the bell,
but suddenly recollecting himself, he smiled and said,  No, no,
that won't do, Peggy, will it? Go, my dear, and ask where the boy
is, and then come back and tell me.''
The damsel, in return, furtively smiled too, in acquiescence and
48
TiME LIFE AND ADVENTURES
approval of his discretion; and upon leaving his study for the pur-
pose of prosecuting her inquiries among the servants, she couldn-
tered the object of them, as he entered the back-door, on his return
from visiting his mother's cottage.
 Soh here you are then? Well, you must come along this mi-
note to Sir Matthew,' said she, addressing him somewhat ruffalo,
and not too well pleased, perhaps, at this interruption to the confi-
dental conversation with her master, which it had been her purpose
to renew. But to the ears of Michael, the name of Sir Matthew
was sufficient to render all other words indifferent:; and conscious
only, that into his dreaded presence he must go if commanded to do
so, he followed the girl with a beating heart, and in a few minutes
stool pale, and almost breathless, before the awful countenance of
the great man.
Sir Matthew gazed at him for a moment with a sort of sneer,
which, if interpreted skilfully, would have been found to address itself
inwardly. Sir Matthew could not choose but sneer at the whim-
sica arrangements of accidents, which had converted him into a
Mr. Allworth. The sneer, however, as far as it concerned himself,
had no mixture of contempt in it.  IPad another done this thing,'
thought he, ` should I not have called him fool? and is it not
ninety-nine chances to a hundred, that thereby I should have de-
scribed him truly? May the same be said of me? No1 B the
living God, it may not: How now, little boy? you have made
yourself smart, I see-vastly fine, indeed! An inch of clean dow-
was, a piece of snan-new green baize for a patch, a pair of bony legs
without stockings, and magnificent shoes-i did not say a pair,
Peggy-but very magnificent shoes; one I suppose won in battle
from a giant, and the other from a dwarf. Fine asa prince: isn't
he, Peggy '
As he thus jeered the little fellow, his eye wandered with mali-
nant popularity over his person, which was, in truth, the very model of
make-shift poverty; while the child, as if he felt his eye palpably
crawL like a reptile over him, shudderel he knew not why.
Then, changing his tone so suddenly, as to make even the con-
finding Peggy start, he continued,  You horrid lump of rags stand
back-stand back 1 back 1 back1 behind that high chair-d'ye
hear 2 Stand close and stand still-if he does not make me as sick
as a dog, Peggy, let me never smell musk more1''
 It does smell horrid bal to be sure, Sir Matthew:'' replied
the girl. ` Can't I better take him back to Molly the kitchen-
maid, and make her scour him 2''
 No, hang him-that won't take it out of him-I know 'em all.
No, Peggy, let the scouring alone, and just go up stairs to the
nursery-maids, and tell them to send me down a good hand-
some suit of clothes, complete, of MAster Duodecimus's-he is the
nearest in size to this scaramouch; and I will dress him, Peggy, at
if he were the son of duke. It will be fun, capital fun, and will it
not be generous, Peggy ?''
Generous, Sir Matthew? It will be past all belief: WHat2

Him to be dressed up in the clothes of Master Duodecimus? oh,
my? Sir Matthew, you must sure-ly be joking.''
Im as serious as an undertaker, girl. Get along with you,
and do what I did you-the longer you're about it, mind, the
longer I shall have to sit in the same room with the ragamuffin in
his own full dress-so make haste, if you please.''
This was said in a manner to remove all doubts as to the munifi-
cent knights being in earnest; and the active Peggy went and
returned with as little delay as was consistent with the necessity
she felt herself under, of entering into some short explanation with
the nursery ladies; one and all of whom seemed much inclined, on
the first opening of her mission, to treat the whole business as a
hoax. When at length, however, she had succeeded in making it
apparent that Sir Matthew was waiting for the suit of clothes in a
most monstrous outrageous passion of a hurry, the messenger's arms
were speedily loaded in exact conformity to the orders .she had
brought, and she returned to the knight's study with all that was
eedful to convert the rude exterior of little Michael into the
nearest resemblance that nature would permic, to the elegant and
accomplished MAster Duodecimus.
Considering the loathing and disgust manifested by Si Matthew
towards the person and the poverty of his protege, it was extra-
binary to see the amusement he seemed to derive from dressing him
up. Tough the alert and obedient Peggy stood close by to do
his pleasure, it was his own large hands the thrust the little limbs
of Michael into the clothing he chose they should wear, and it was
amidst shouts of laughter from both, that the ludicrous memory-
phosis was completed.
bUt somehow or other when they had finished their masquerading
work, the result was not altogether what Sir MAtthew anticipated.
The clothes were very handsome, well-made clothes, and as poor
MIchael, notwithstanding his likeness, was a very handsome, well-
made by, the incongruity between them seemed to vanish in th
most unaccountable matter, as the operation drew towards a con
clinton.
Peggy, however, was not such a fool as not to understand what
was expected of or; so when the knight, catching up his son's tas-
sealed cap, pressed it down upon the little curly head as a lusty packer
of worthless goods thrusts down the cover that is to enclose them,
and then pushed the child towards her with an impulse that nearly
brought him upon his nose, she very judicious renewed her noisy
slaughter, exclaimiug, ` Did any one ever see such a little quiz 1'
liz, girl'' replied Sir Matthew, eyeing hin with no very fond
expression.  It would be well for the scamp if that was the worst
you could say of him-I know a thing or two eggy, and that
boy will be lucky if he gets drowned. I'Ll be a hundred guineas
that with a few lessons, he would forge any writing you could show
him; and beliore he is twenty, he will have taken as many shapes as
Turpin. That boy was born with a halter round his neck, l want
no gypsy to tell me that.''

50
THE LIFE AND ADVENTURES5
During the whole of the undressing and redressing operations, the
boy's cheeks had been dyed with brushes, and his eyes so friendly
nailed to the floor, that neither Sir Matthew nor his said had been
able to enjoy their embarrassed expression; but as this dark pro-
they fell on him, he looked up, and it was well for him that his
magnificent patron at the same instant turned his mocking glances
towards the servant, as he said,  There-gather up his rags, girl,
and be sure you wash well after it;'' for, had he met that speaking
5hung eye, he could hardly have misunderstood the scorn that shot
from it. As it was, however, he saw nothing but the patched gar-
ments that were scattered round, and once more sneering as he
looked at them, he added, ` Lead the  little blackguard through
the servants'-hall, and into Mrs. Thompson's parlour-d'ye hear,
Peggy, up to her very nose, and tell her that I have sent him to pay
her a visit, and when she has had enough of the compliment, lead
him round to Mademoiselle's room, and well have a little fun among
the children.''
By no means displeased with an errand which permitted her to
affront with impunity thc autocrat of all the offices, Peggy gathered
together Michael's discarded wardrobe and then clutching hold of
his hand, led him, on gre mal are, to the presence of the imperious
housekeeper.
MIrs. WiLlis, my Lady Dowling's own maid, and Mr. Jennings,
my Lady Dowling's own man, were enjoying with that important
functionary a slight morning repast of fruit, cakes, and wine, and at
the moment Peggy an her chargeentered, they were enjoying some
very excellent jokes together. Bt, Mr. Jennings no sooner cast
his eyes on the little factory-hoy, than he arose, looking rather
abashed at being caught by a drawing-room guest of even nine
years old, with a glass of claret in one hand, and a slice of pine-
apple in the other.
Peggy, to whom the conciliatory smiles of this gay gentleman did
not descend, enjoyed his mystification exceedingly : and relaxing
her rough hold of Michael's wrist, sho led him respectfully towards
the table saying, `` My master has sent this young gentleman ta
ay you a visit, Mrs. Thompn; perhaps he would like a little fruit.
There, my dear, that's the housekeeper fAir Matthew told you of, and
if you will please to go and sit down by her, I dare say she will give
you something nice.''
Mr. Jennings immediately placed a chair beside the gracious
Mrs. Thompson, who, after filling and setting before the young
gentleman a plate with whatever she supposed would be most
agreeable, said in a half whisper to his conductor,  Who is it,
Peggy? I didn't hear never a carriage.''
Before she could, or at least before she would answer, MIchael,
who had not accepted the chair offered to him, took his cap from
his head, and with considerably more courage than he had yet
shown said, :`I am Michael Armstrong, the factory-boy.''
WV61 WI1'' screamed the housekeeper; `what bold joke
is this, Mrs. Peggy Perkins? Do you think you have got a patent
for your place, that you are play such tricks as this ?''
o IIICIIAIEL ARMSTRONG.
51
If I keeps my place, I don't think I shall have to thank you for
it, mama,'' replied the favoured housemaid, with very little civility.
My master ordered me to bring the boy to pay you a visit; those
was his very words, Mrs. Thompson, and as I was bid, so I have
done.''
There's some people as will do every thing and any thing they
are bid,'' observed Mrs. Willis, again drawing out her favourite
smelling-bottle, while with the other hand she extended a wine-glass
to MIr, Jennings, for a little Madeira, which she felt was absolutely
necessary to support her in this very disagreeable emergency-
 Master, or n master, Sir Matthew Dowling doesn't know
how to behave himself-it's I says it, and I don't care who repeats
it to his.''
Mr. Jennings stared at the factory-of for a full minute very
attentiely, and then gave a long low whistle, at the same time
turning his eyes with a look of much intelligence full in the face of
the housekeeper.
He isn't at all like any of 'em, Mrs. Thompson,'' said he.
MIrs. Thompson shook her head. e There is nothing at all in that,
Mr. Innings, I'm some to say. BUt remember I do desire, and
insist, that the subject is never alluded to in my sleeve again-
When 1 lived with his grace, I always made it a rule that none of
the household should ever discourse in my presence of any thing
that it was not decent to hear.''
 WEll, ma'am,'' said Peggy: `when you have done looking
at him, he is to go into Moseley's room for the children to see
him.''
The housekeeper, the lady's-said, and the footman, all simulta-
nervous lifted up their hands and eyes to heaven.
 Please to let me put on my old clothes and go home,'' said
Michael.
 Yon little ungrateful wretch :' exclaimed eggy; `' when Sir
Matthew dressed you up himself with his own hands. What d'ye
mean by that, you bad boy?'
They'Il laugh at me,'' said Michael, resolutely; `and I don't
like i.'
you don't Isn't that a good one?'' said Mr. Jennings, step-
ping his hands in ecstasy.  Oh, Lord: pray let us have him back
again, Mrs. Peggy, that is to say if Sir Matthes can bear to part
with him. He's the finest fun i've got sight of this many a day.''
 You must find fun for yourself, Mr. Jennings, for I shan't be at
the trouble of bringing you none,'' replied the self-satisfied Peggy.
again seizing the hand of Michael, and leaving him off
Well, for a broom-said, I hope she's saucy enough,'' said Mr.
Jennings; but the subject of his remark was already beyond hear-
ing, threading her way through the long stone passages which con-
ducted to the opposite wing of the mansion, the whole of which was
appropriate to the younger branches of the Dowling family.

ViX given a sharper on the door, Peggy was told to ``com
even,' by the voice of Mndemoiselle Beaulieu; whereupon she threw
the door wideopen before her, and stool with Michael Armstrong in
her hand, in the presence of three grown-up Miss Dowlings, three
middle-sized Miss Dowlings, two little MIss Dowlings, and their
French governess.
The five youngest, all rushed as by one accord towards Michael.
 What a pretty little boy 1' was exclaimed by two or three of
them. `` Are you come to play with us? MAny't we have a holi-
day, Ma'moselle 2'
 WHaT an elegant-looking creature I' exclaimed the eldest Miss
Dowling, who with her two grown-eup sisters, had come into the
room for the advantage of practising duets on a venerable pianoforte
totally out of tune, and whose loudest note could by no means
compete with the shrill accents of the animated group who inca-
cited the apartment. Did you ever see a prettier boy, Harriet?''
 WHo is he, I wonder ?'' replied the young lady she addressed.
 How he bushes I'' said the governess, littering.
WHat's your name, dear?'' demanded Miss Martha, the third
daughter of the Dowling race.
.  Michael Armstrong, mama,'' replied the boy, poking in with
an air of surprise, for MIss martha, queer-looking as she was, spoke
kindly. Aid queer-looking as she was, Michael met her eye with
pleasure, for that too spoke kindly, though it was neither large non
bright.
Martha Dowling was in truth, about as ugly as i was possible for
a girl of seventeen to be, who was neither deformed nor marked by
the smallpox,-short, fat, such-nosed, red-faced, with a quantity of
sandy hair, that, if not red, looked very much as if it intended to
be so: eyes of a light, very light gray, and without any thing
whatever in external appearance to recommend her, except a
month, plump, neck and shoulders, with hands and arms to match,
which, in truth were very fair and nice-looking, and a set of well-
formed, stout white teeth.
IT made the unlucky appearance of this young lady this
more remarkable, was the contrast it presented to theresa of her
family. All the other young people were, like both their parents,
`` more than common tall,'' for their respective ages, and, like most
other tall young people, rather than, so that Lady bowling was apt to
indulge herself by declaring that, '` though certainly some of her
children might be considered prettier than the rest, there was not

one of the whole set (except that poor vulgar Martha), who was not
most particular genteel-looking.''
2`Gcnteel looking'' she certainly was not, nor graceful, nor
beautiful in any way: und thc consequence was, that father, mo-
the, brothers, and sisters, were all most heartily ashamed of her.
This was a misfortune, and she felt it to be so pretty sharply, for
poor vulgar Martha was far from being a stupid girl. But, in her.
case, as in a million of others, it might be seen that adversity,
though
LIke the nnl. ugly and venomous,
Warmth a precious jewel in its head.''
for of all her race she was the only one whose heart was not seared
and hardened by the ceaseless operation of opulent self-indus-
since. She felt that she was rather an object of pity than of admi-
ration, of contempt than of envy, of dislike than of love. `This is
severe schooling for a young girl's heart, but if it produce not
reckless indifference, or -callous sensibility, it often purified,
softens, and even elevates the character. Such were its effects on
MArtha Dowling: that coarse-seeming exterior contained the only
spark of refinement of which the Dowling family could boast.
Never did a high-horn Hidalgo, in Spain's proudest days. ineulcate
among his race the immeasurable importance of pure descent, with
more ceaseless or more sensuous earnestness, than did Sir Matthew,
the omnipotence of wealth among his. Every child was taught, as
soon as its mind became capable of receiving the important truth,
that not only was it agreeable to enjoy and cherish all the good
things which wealth can procure, but that it was their bounded and
special duty to make it visible before the eyes of all men that they
could, and that they did, have more money spent upon them, than
any other family in the whole country; but Martha felt that all this
could not apply to her.
Strange to say, the only tie resembling affection which prevented
the total isolation of this poor girl among her family, was that
which existed between her hard-natured father and herself; but it
was a sentiment not easy to analyze. In Sir Matthew it pro-
baby arose at first from his having been told that the little girl was
very like him; and, on hers, from his being the only person in the
house who had ever bestowed a cares pon her. In both cases,
cause and effect went on increasing. Martha's face (saving its ex-
pression), was incontrovertibly like her father's; and, for that rea-
son, or from the habit it had at first created, her father, though
rather ashamed to confess it, was certainly very fond of her.
That, as a child, she should love him in return, was almost in-
evitable; but that, as she advanced in years, she should feel for the
being, the most completely formed by nature to the hateful to her,
an election the most unchanging and devoted, had something of
mystery in it less censy to be explained. et, so it as. Martha
Dowling adored her hard-hearted, vicious, unprincipled, illiterate,
vulgar father, as heartily as if he had been the model of every thing
she most admired and approved. Nay, it may be, that she loved him

to Martha as he uttered it, as if anxious to see how she bore it, but he
encountered a look that altogether puzzled him; for thought was
at least as kind as before, there was uneasiness in it, and she looked
round her, as if uncomfortably doubtful of what would happen
next.
he did not, however, wait long for the result: or MIss Sophia,
MIss Louisa, and Miss Charlotte, the the middling-sized Miss
Dowlings, who had approached very near to the little boy, and were
even growing so familiar that Miss Charlotte had taken hold of one
of his dark curls, were severally and suddenly drawn off by the re-
species hands of their two eldest sisters, and the governess.
Then he is not a young gentleman after all ?'' said Miss
Sophia.
`La; how funny'' exclaimed Miss Louisa, ``where did he get
his clothes from ?'' interrogated Miss Harriet.
``Most likely he stole them,'' responded Miss Arabella.
Why 'tis Duodecimus's jacket I'' ejaeulated the observing MIss
Charlotte.
Oh1 quell shorter 1' cried the governess driving her pupils
all before her to the other end of the room.
At this moment, and before amy more active measures could be re-
sorted to for the safety of the young ladies,the door of the school-room
was again shown open, and the portly person of Sir Matthew
appeared at it, accompanied by the globe-like figure of Doctor
Crockley.
Good morning young ladies'' said the proud father, looking
round him, and immediately entering into the west that he saw was
afloat. How do you like the young beau I have sent you?''
Good gracious, papa l'' exclaimed the elegant and much ad-
mired Miss Arabella, `' he is a beggar-boy and a thief1'
Bir Matthew, and his friend Doctor Crockley, both burst into
such a shout of laughter at this sally, that it was a minute before
either of them could speak; but at length the knight, turning to the
doctor, said,
Lead my girls alone, Crockley, for finding out what's what; I
don't believe there's one of them but what would have found that
ello out, if I had wrapped him up in the kings own angle'
They are sharp enough, there is no doubt of that,'' replies his
friend, ` but I must say you don't perform your charitable acts by
hales, Sir Matthew. Yon hae dressed up the little scamp se
superbly, that nothing but the vulgar lark complexion could make
one know that he was not one of your own,''
 Wh yes, there is some difference in the skins I must say,'' re-
plicd Sir Matthews, looking with most parental complacency on the
fair skins, flaxen hair, and light eyelashlies of his race.
Difference, indeed: STig Africa and Europe. And is it not re-
markablc Sir Matthew to see the lack of him? Hasn he get a
sort of slash, terrified air with it? I tell you what, Sir Matthew,
I should not be at all surprised to find, when the march of philo-
sophy has got a little farther, that the blackmoor look comes along

quence is as quickly shown upon the external appearance of men.
women, and children, as a field of clover upon the inferior animals.
And why.not ? It is quite natural-perfectly comfortable to the
analogy, that, by accurately tracing cause and effect, may be
followed through all creation. You have a head, Sir Matthew, for
that sort of thing: you can understand me, if nobody else cnn.''
The little doctor knew that this was one of the soft points at
which his wealthy neighbour was available. Sir matthew loved to
be assured that his head was of a superior fabric.
Bt why, papa, should you send a nasty beggar-boy to us, with
Duo's clothes on1'' inquire the intelligent Louisa. Before he
replied to this, the knight exchanged a glance with his friend,
which seemed to say, `` that's the right sort-she's in the clover-
field.''
I have taken him in for charity, my dear,'' replied the knight,
with a sort of pomposity that seemed of a new pattern. The young
ladies had never seen papa look so before. MArtha, from having
found herself rather more frequently the object of Dr. Crockley's
jokes than she desired, had, on his entering the room, retired to the
window, but now she came up to her father, and quietly, and as
often happened, almost unnoticed, kissed his hand.
For charity ?'' exclaimed the fair-haired Arabella, moving a step
or two farther away from the object of this extraordinary caprice.
 Ln Papa: hy don't you send him to the hospital?'
Doctor Crockley laughed outrageously.  That girl, Sir Mat-
them,'' he said, when he had recovered his voice, `` that girl is be-
bond all comparison the most thoroughly-born lady that ever 1
happened to hit upon-and that is saying something, I promise to.
She hasn't n commonplace vulgar notion in her from top to toe. It
is what I call the physiology of wealth-it is upon my soul-it is a
study, a science. I have not got to the end of it, but I am certain
I shall make a system out of it-and you'll be able to follow me,
there's some comfort in that. I declare to God, that if I had not
found you in the neighbourhood, I should have bolted. I cannot
exist without occasionally bringing my mind in contact with superior
intellect; you find that, too, Sir matthew, I'm sure you lo.''
Sir Matthew assured him that he did, very much: and then
pulling a Belinda lck that adorned the olive-coloured throat of
Mademoisclle IBeaujoie, he asked her if she had ever seen a brat,
taken in for charity, so nicely dressed as that little blackguard.''
 Brawl? ca vest dire petite vast-rien. No, my honor Sire
MAtter, unravel you are viaduct no reval de most-''
Whilst the French governess struggled to find a word sufficiently
expressive of admiration, and if possible, with some little meaning
besides, Sir matthew took the liberty of pinching her ear, while he
whispered into it,  What, you little rogue? what?'
She gave him a Parisian village, by no means an unkind one,
and turned away, while the two smallest Miss Dowlings ran up to
her, and, in the jargon in which their mamma and papa delighted,
o MICHaEL AaISTnONG.
57
demanded ``si papa voulait let them jouer sec the little beggar-
boy ?'
This question, repeated nearly in the same words by Madero-
selle Beauvoir to the knight, appeared to cause him some perplexity,
and, after reflecting upon it for a minute, he turned to consult his
philosophical friend.
I say Crockley, what do you think of that ?'' Then lowering his
voice, he added, '` you comprehend the job, doctor,--which will do
best to help i? Parlour or kitchen, school-room or factory,
drawing-room or scullery?
` All and every of them,'' replied his friend, in the same to
tone, but very decisively. e No doubt in nature about that, Sir
Matthew; he must be here, there, and every where, and the thing
will fly like mad.''
You are always right Crowley, there is nobody like you,'' re-
plied the grateful knight, cordially slapping the round shoulders of
his friend,  I twig, I twig, and so it shall be, by the Lord
Harry.''
You are as rapid as lightning, Sir Matthew . I remember no in-
stance of a cerebral formation so absolutely perfect as yours. Now
then, let us visit my lady, shall we? I am as dry as brickdast,
and it is about lunch-time I take it. Bring the boy with you, and
introduce him before the servants in style.''
So1 will-the's it-I twig, Crockley. Go, Martha, and see if
the luncheon is laid.''
The report being favourable to the wishes of the gentleman, the
army, consisting of the three eldest Miss Dowlings, their papa and the
doctor, left the young Ladies and their governess to dine, while, with
little Michael, who was ordered to follow, they all repaired to the
dining-room, where a well-covered table awaited them.
Her ladyship and Mr. Augustus were already there, and both
expressed exactly the degree of curiosity which the knight desired,
as to who the little gentleman might be whom they brought with
them.
MIss Dowling,' and Miss HArriet Dowling, burst into a loud
laugh; Sir Mathew looked towards the sideboard, and seeing two
servants in attendance there, spoke as follows:
My car Lady Dowling, I must bespeak your magnificent cha-
city, and universal benevolence in favour of this little unhappy boy.
His mother is a widow, and-and something, I forget exactly what,
is very unhappy about her-and this little boy behave remarkably
well---'' Here Sir Matthew broke off in some degree of embarrass-
ment, not wishing particularly to impress upon his lady's mind that
it was his tender care for the Lady Clarissa Sharpton, which had first
introduced the fortunate factory-boy to his notice. But he passed
all that over very skilfully, and ended his harangue by saying. 1
know perfectly well, my dear lady Dowling, that there is not in the
whole world so amiable a person as yourself, and therefore I enter-
tain not the slightest doubt, that the benevolence which warms my
heart on this occasion, will communicate itself to yours.''

TIME LIPE AMD ADVENTURE
Lady Dowling raised her light eyebrows, and her still lighter
eyelashes, into a look of the most unmitigaled astonishment, and
remained thus for a while, contemplating the extraordinary spec-
table, of one of the handsomest boys she had ever seen, dressed in
a style of unquestionable fashion, and presented to her as a being
so deplorably miserable, as to have excited the city of her hus-
band. The first clear and distinct idea that suggested itself was,
the necessity of inquiring respecting this beautiful child's mother,
and of finding out whether she might not happen to be beautiful to;
the next arose from the sudden recognition of her own son's on
clothes, and the completion of the lady became extremely florid,''
I should like to know where he got those clothes from,'' she
said in accents that by no means poke composure of spirit.
MIy dcarest love,'' replied the most amiable and the most polite
of husbands, `` that is entirely my doing. You have known me
long enough, my sweetest, to be aware that never do any thing by
halves-I saw that little fellow ragged and wretched, and I clothed
him 
Well, I must say, I do think--'' began her ladyship, when Sir
Matthew, seating himself at the table, thrust a knife and fork into
the very centre of a pigeon-pie, and accompanied the act by a
sound, something between a slight cough and a grunt, which, in
language matrimonial, was known to mean,  You had better hold
your tongue and mind your business.'' Whereupon, Lady Dowling
sat down too, but her fair complexion was rather more rosy than
was becoming, and it was in no very sweet voice that she said to
Martha, who ventured to take a chair next her, '` To get a little
farther, child, can't you 2--you know i have to be crushed and
crammed up so.''
Here Dr. Crockley, who had already fallen with vehemence upon
a cold ham, stopped for a moment, and laughed vehemently.
MIy dear madam, you are of the light and elegant order your-
self, and you don't make allowance for poor people who are as fat
and roundabout as Miss Martha and I-we can't squeeze ourselves
into an eggshell, Miss Martha, can we?''
Her slim sisters littered, and the witty Augustus observed, that
To be sure, Martha did look more like a collar of Oxford brawn,
than any thing else in creation.''
Meanwhile, the meal proceeded, and little' Michael continued to
stand half-way between the door and the table, as fixed as if he
had taken root there.
March was, in general, very philosophically inclined to let all
things round her take their course ; but she sat exactly opposite to the
object of her father's benevolence, and there was something in the
expression of his eye, as it rested upon the dainties before him, that
was more than she could bear. `` MAy I give the little boy some-
thing to eat, papa'' said she addressing her father in a timid
voice,
How shall we manage about that, Crockley 7'' whispered Sir
MAtthew into the year of the doctor who sat close to him.

the surface of water, spreading far and wide,'' replied his counsellor,
whispering in return, ` Let the boy have to boast of his high
feeding, and it will do more good than if you were to endow him
with lands and houses, and keep him lean.''
``Say you so, my wise man1 Faith, then, the matter is easy
enough, For I believe Dowling Lodge is rather celebrated for its su-
perfluiy af good cheer. We'll have him gasping with indigestion
within a week, see if we don't'' Then raising his voice, he an-
served the petition of Martha, by repeating her words,  May you
give the little boy something to eat ?'' and then added with a laugh,
 By all manner of means, Miss Martha; and,'' taking some half.
demolished fragments of his own plate, ``he may boast of feeding
as well as his master. Were, Master Factory, catch'' And so
saying, the benevolent owner or Dowling Lodge skilfully cut the
air with half a pigeon, which, taking exactly the direction he in-
tended, struck Michael in the middle of his forehead. Whatever
might be the effect of this liberality of heart and hand out of
doors, Sir MAtthew had every reason to be satisfied with the result
within.
The whole Dowling family, with the exception of stupid Martha,
burst into a simultaneous shout of delight, while Dr. Crockley
clapped his hands, and vociferated,  Role'' as loud as he could
sCream.
Just at this moment, the great bell at the front door, and it was
a very great bell, resoundel along passage and halls with prodigious
clamour. This is a sound which produces, in those who hear it,
emotions varying according to their varying temperaments. Ge-
nuinely fine, poco curate people, if they hear it, heed it not.
Fussy folks, of whatever rank or station, prepare their looks and the
books, themselves and their belongings, to receive the threatened
visitation advantageously; but in a mansion of such professional
display as Dowling Lodge, a ring at the door-bell is an event of
serious importance. In such an establishment, the luxuries, or
even the comforts of the family, are confessedly of no importance
at all, when placed in competition with the display of their
grandeur; and on the present occasion, the whole family has-
tended to leave their unfinished repast, in order to receive the we-
come spectator of their fine clothes and fine furniture in the draw-
lng-room.
 My Lady Dowling, and her two light-coloured elder daughters,
Sir MAtthew, his eldest son, and his learned friend, succeeded in
reaching their respective sofas and mergers half minute before
the door was thrown open, and Lady Clarissa Slimpton, Miss
DBrotherton, Miss Moog, and MIr. Osmond Norval were an-
bounced.
Great, of course, and very zealous was the joy expressed by the
Dowsling family at the sight of heir illustrious friend and her cor-
the. Miss Brotherton was, indeelof herself, or rather of her purse,
a personage pretty sure of being well received every where; but
6o
THE LE AD ADVENTURES
even Miss ogg was (in yankee phrase) ell shaken, and Mr.
Osmond Norval gazed at by the young ladies, as an emanation
from the rays that encircle the row of Apollo; while even the ex-
quite Augustus ventured, in compliment to his titled patroness,
to shake him too, though he had never been introduced to him at
Oxford.
But the feelings of sir Matthew, at this prompt reappearance of
his fair and noble friend, were something vastly different from any
thing his family could participate in, nor did Lady Clarissa mistake
them. There was a look that spoke infinitely more than any tongue
could utter, and a meaning in the silent pressure of the hand, con-
firming the idea, which had often recurred to her during the night,
that it would soon be necessary to make Sir Matthew understand
the exactnature and extent of the flattering, but perfectly innocent
preference she was conscious of feeling or him.
This first delightful, but somewhat agitating moment over, Lady
Clarissa hastened to explain the purpose of her visit.
 You guess why um come, do you not, Sir Matthew?'' she
said, pointing to Mr. Osmond Normal.t Permit me to present to
you, and your highly-educated family, this young ovary of the
muses, who, if my judgment errs not, may fairly claim compete-
tion with the first poets of these. Nor should we, of this remote
neighbourhood, he insensible to the honour of being the first to
assist in plumbing the yet inflected wing, which shall one day bea
him aloft into the pyrenean regions of eternal fame.''
Nothing could be more touching than the manner in which MIr.
Osmond Norval pressed his hat between his two hands, and bowed
low, low, low, to the noble lady who thus announced him. ir
Matthew, with a strike which, for the vigorous distance it carried
him, might have been compared to that of the knave of hearts, ap-
approach the young man, and strenuously pressing one of his
slender hands in both his own capacious fists, attested the value he
attached to her ladyship's introduction by saying,  Mr. Osmond
Norval !-I will not deny, that I do occasionally myself offer tri-
but at the muse's shrine:; and that being in some sort a brother of
the craft, I most unfeignedly rejoice in making the acquaintance of
a gentleman so distinguished in it as yourself. BUt that is not the
feeling, sir, which principally leads me to tell you, that from this
time forth, I shall hold you as one of my most esteemed friends-
you understand me. That lady, sir,'' hinting to LAdy Clarissa,
` is a person whose lightest word ought to be law in this neighbour-
hood,-and to me, is so. If you public any works, put Sir Matthew
Dowling's name down, sir, for fifty copies; should you find yourself
at any time in want of a library, ray remember that there is one
of no very small limits at Dowling Lodge; and your reception, sir,
in my drawing-room, and at my dinner-table, will ever be such as
befits me to bestow on one honoured by the patronage of Lady
Clarissa Sharpton.''
Before this speech was quite finished, Lady Dowling becoming
rather fidgetty, ventured to mutter something about its being far

better to sit down to talk; but Miss Brotherton was greatly too
much amused by what was passing to hear her: and for Miss MIogg
to sit while hcr patroness stool, was quite out of the question: so
that lAdy Dowling, and the two eldest Miss Dwellings, continued
to stand like three finely-dressed flaxen-headed statues, to the end
of it.
Sir Matthew than led the high-born lady to a chair, while Mise
Brotherton perceiving that her conversation with the knight was
now reduced to a whisper, and that consequently there would be
no more fun in listening to it, conlescended at last to answer a few
of the amiable inquiries after her health, which were addressed to
her by Mr. Augustus and his two sisters. Meanwhile, the young
Norval, with pensive eye intent on nature's beauties, stole his way
to the open window, and there having twice or thrice passed his
lingers through his long loss, which descended disordered curls
almost to his shoulders, and once and again buttoned and uncut-
toned the broad shirt-collar which fell back, unrestrained by that
most unintellectual ligature, a cravat, remained partly, it might be,
to let the young ladies look at him, and partly to receive the fra-
grant breeze of summer upon his brow.
it was now that Dr. Crockley felt he was called upon to do
something that might bring him into notice, and waldling up to
the young poet. he addressed him with an air of incipient friend-
ship, which seemed to say, `And I too am somebody.''
You will find this neighbourhood not very prolific, young gen-
leman, in such gifts of intellect as a poet requires in order to be
duly appreciated. Nevertheless, I will not deny that there is
amongst us a not, a little knot, Mr. Norval, whom, upon further
acquaintance, you may find not altogether uncongenial. For my-
self', I may venture to say, that i am as warmly devoted to every
subject, directly or indirectly, connected with the divine, ethereal,
immaterial, intellectual part of our composite formation, as it is
possible for a man to be, and it will give me pleasure, sir, to make
your acquaintance.'' As this was spoken with energy, the 'sultry
losses made itself felt under the exertion, and Dr. Crockley found
it necessary so far to remember the vile portion of his composite
formation, as to sipe his face and bald head assiduously.
The poet bowed, but not as he had bowed to Lady Clarissa.
MEanwhile, Lady Darling, her light-coloured daughters, and
MIss lOgged, sat profoundly silent upon two chairs and one sofa of
the splendid apartment; Miss Brotherton and Mir. Augustus eon-
tinted to talk about nothing, and Sir Matthew and Lady Clarissa
ceased not to mutter, what none but themselves could hear, upon
an ottoman, which stood in front of' a distant window. If eye-
beams could have interrupted a tote-d-state, theirs would not have
long continued to proceed undisturbed; for the mistress of Dowling
Lodge did certainly cast not a few anxious glances towards the
master of it; but it was not for that reason that he at length got
up and rather hastily left the room.
62
THE LIFE AND ADVENTURES
WHile all this was passing in the drawing-room, Martha Dow-
lg and Michael Armstrong remained alone together in the
dining-room.
The flying pigeon, impelled by the beneficent Sir Matthew, having
hit the forehead of his highly-favoured protege at the very moment
that the labrum, announcing Lady Clarissa's arrival made itself
heard, the greatly amused company left the room before it was
possible to ascertain what would become of it.
The chill ``caught it were it came to the ground;'' but having
done so, held it by one leg with an air of very comical indecision,
till Dr. Crockley, who respectfully walked the last out of the room,
shut the door behind him.
The eyes of the factory-hoy and the ugly girl then met.  Come
to the table, my dear,'' said Martha; `and if you like that bird,
eat it-here is a plate and knife and work for you: but if you like
any thing else hetter, leave it, and tell me what you will have,''
Michael opened his magnificent black eyes, and looked earncstly
at her. He approached the table, laid down the half-dissected
pigeon, but said not a word.
 You would like something else better, would you not ?'' said
Martha, smiling at him.
 I don't know,'' answered Michael, returning the smile.
e You don't know-cannot you tell what you should like?2''
 No ma'am, if nepalese; I don't know what any of it is.''
 My dear child, it is all very good, I belieso, only you know
some people like one thing, and some another. Little boys gene-
rally like something very sweet. Here is some cake, what do you
say to that 2''
I know what I should like best,'' said Michael,
 Do you2-then you shall have it, if you will tell me what it
s'
Something good for mother,'' said the child, blushing violently;
 but you must send me, and order me to take it to her, or else it
will be stealing it.''
 Very well, I will send something to her; but you must eat
something yourself first. What shall it bec, Michael ?' This ar-
agreement seemed to put the buoyant a state of perfect ecstasy:
he clapper his hands, raised one foot, and then the other, with
childish glee, and exclaimed in an accent from which all timidity
had fled, e Oh: dear, ohl dear, how nice''
e WHat, the cake 2-or the grapes ?-or what ?''
 Taking it to mother1 Taking it to mother '' cried Michael.
 Then you love mother very much, Michael?'' said Martha,
drawing the child towards her, and kissing his smooth dark fore-
head. Michael nodded his head, and nestled closer to her.
t WEll, then, never mind about the case at present; but I must
find a little basket, must I not -I will give you a basket if you
will take care of it and bring it back to me, because perhaps we
may want it again.-There, you may eat that if you are hungry,
o MICHAEL ARmStRONG.
63
while I am gone away-I shall be back again in a minute.'' So
saying, she placed some bread and meat before him, and left the
ATOMiC.
Michael had by no means lost his appetite by his morning walk
to Huxley-lane, and being in excellent spirits to boot, he sat down
and began to devour what had been set before him with very zealous
eagerness.
He had not, however, done one-half of what he was capable of
performing, when another door, opposite to the one by which
Martha had made her it, opened, and Sir Matthew Dowling
walled in.
Michael's knife and active fingers remained suspended midway
between his mouth and the plate; the colour forsook his cheek,
and his eye sunk as if unable to meet that of his magnificent
patron.
 WHat stuffing still, you greedy little rascal? What have you
touched with your nasty factory finger? No the grapes, I lope?''
Michael tried to say ``no,'' but did not succeed in producing
the sound; so contented himself by letting the forefinger of his
left hand drop into his plate to show how he had been engaged.
Don't look so like a fool, you of,'' said Sir Matthew, taking
him by the shoulder, and shaking him with some vivacity.L
 You
are to come along with me, do you hear that ? and see a lot of fine
folks, and to look up at them to, do you hear that; and by A-d
if you blubber, or look grumpish, I'll have you strapped ten times
over, worse than you ever saw done at the factory. Come along--
and mind what I have promised, for I'll keep it, and worse, that you
may rely,''
Michael behaved like a little hero. He remembered the promised
basket, and the voice that had told him he should have it; he re-
memberel Huxley-lane too, and his mother, and Teddy, and their
morsel of dry bread; so he walked manfully along beside Sir
Matthew, and when they reached the drawing-room door, and his
benefactor stretched forth a hand to take his, he yielded it to him,
with scarcely any perceptible shudder.
Bir Matthew walked some steps forward, with the boy in his
hand, into the drawing-room, and then standing quite still, pointed
to the child, and said, `` Lady Clarissa behold the factory-hoy I'
Nothing could be more skilful than this form of presentation, for
it told Lady Clarissa every thing, and Lady Dowling nothing.
Lady Clarissa spring from her seat and ran towards the child.`` Is
it possible?'' she exclaimed, with every appearance of violent
emotion.  O]HI Sir Matthew ' these last words were audible
only to the knight and the little boy; but as the latter could make
nothing of them, and the former almost any thing he pleased, it was
evident that the lady was as well skilled in saying more than met
the year, as the gentleman.
 Indeed, indeed,'' said Lady Clarissa, driving forth another of
the confronted handkerchiefs, `` indeed, indeed, this is a noble act,
Bir Matthew 1
64
TRY LIE AD ADVENTURE
IIere her Iadyship pressed her handkerchief to her eyes, and
remained in the eloquent silence of that position for a moment,
then raising herself from the softness that, as she hinted to Sir
MAtthew, in a whisper, she felt stealing upon her, she called to Mr.
Osmond Norval, and said in a tone audible to all present,  Os-
mond Norval1 favoured of Heaven, and the museo Let not this
beautiful subject escape you: LOok at this pretty boy-look at
the delicate air of aristocratic refinement which pervades his person.
Osmond, the earth has not made her daily circuit round the sun
since I beheld this child the very type of sordid wretchedness;
would you know the hand that wrought this wondrons change'
WOuld you learn what heart suggested it? Behold them here%''
and Lady Clarissa laid her noble fingers on the coat-sleeve of Sir
Matthew Dowling.
 Her ladyship does Sir mAtthew Dowling no more than justice
Mr, Normal,'' said Doctor Crockley approaching the group. : This
is an act that ought to be given to fame, and, if Sir Matthew him-
self does not object to it, I would suggest its being recorded y
your pen, in such a form as may give it general circulation.
The poet pressed his hand upon his heart, and bowed profoundly,
and then, raising the other and to his forehead, he stood for some
time silently meditating on the theme thus offered to him. During
this interval, the different groups which surrounded him formed a
most charming picture. The young man himself stood apart, and
unconscious, perhaps, became the entirety which every eye-beam
converged. Lady Clarissa and Sir Matthew, side by side, and, at
no great distance from him, awaited his reply; her ladyship with
an affectionate smile on her lip, that spoke at once her confidence
in his power and will to do what she required of him. Sir Mat-
the's expression of countenance could not be read so plainly;
it was grave, but it might be doubtful whether its gravity proceeded
from displeasure that the answer should be delayed, or solely from
the deep interest the subject possessed for him. Ludy Dowling, with
her hands crossed helore her, sas seated on a sofa exactly in front
of them, with her light eyes rather more widely open than usual,
looking straight forward, and her small features seeming to indicate
that she was not in the sweetest humour in the world. lDr, Crock-
ley, his hands in his waistcoat-pockets, and his short legs rather
widely extended, in what dancing-masters term the second position,
swayed himself with nice balance to and fro, as if measuring the
interval of suspense by seconds vibrated by his person. MIss
Arabella Dowling, and Miss Harriet Dowling sat close together
upon an ottoman, ` like to a double cherry,'' of the Bigarreau
kind, with their four eyes so fixed upon the poet that it seemed as if
they had but one heart and one soul between them; and on this sub-
ject at least, their hearts and souls, if not one, were the same; for
they had both, and at the very same instant, fallen violently in love
with MIr. Osmond Norval.
or ISRAEL ARMSTRONG.

In a deep arm-chair, in which she had almost buried herself, sat,
or rather lay, little MIss Brotherton, almost convulsed with laughter,
and with her pocket-handkerchief by no means elegantly applied to
her mouth (being nearly half of it within it), in the hope of stifling,
at least, the sound of her mirth, while Mr. Augustus leant in an
attitude of very distinguished elegance on the back of her chair.
A little behind her appeared Miss Moog, who was in truth neither
sitting nor standing, but perched very insecurely on the extreme
edge of a concl, which uncomfortable attitude she had chosen from
not feeling quite certain whether she ought to stand like Lady
Clarissa, or sit like Miss Brotherton. The first she feared was to
dignified and distinguished for her; the last too comfortable, and
she deserved credit for hitting upon a position so far removed from
either: and lastly,.very near the door by which he had entered, and
to which he had sunk baek he knew not how, stood MIchael.
Tis picturesque state of things having lasted quite long enough,
Osmond Norval raised his eyes from the ground to the face of Lady
Clarissa, and making a sudden step forwards, dropped on one knee
an seized her hand. He attempted to speak, but for some time
his voice appeared perfectly choked by emotion. At last, how-
ever, he recovered the power of articulation and said, `` Such a sub-
ject-Oh, heaven-at your bidding tool Best and dearest Lady
Clarissa: Can you doubt that all my power and strength will be
put in requisition for it? But-may lI ask-is it to be published
by subscription 2'
Without immediately replying to this interesting, and to Mr.
Osmond Norval most important inquiry, Lady Clarissa suddenly
clapped her hands together with a sort of vehement enthusiasm that
looked very like delirium. Ben Sir Matthew, though his intimacy
with her had more than once made him the witness to some extra-
binary freaks, looked at her with astonishment: Lady Dowling's
eyes were more widely opened than ever; Miss Moog instinctively
thrust her hand into her bag in search of a smelling-bottle; and
Miss Brotherton took her handkerchief out of her mouth, and
looked grave.
I have got it1 Oh, I have got it'' she exclaimed. e What a
delicious idea I-Let us sit down 1 MIogg, push forward that couch,
child.-Poor girl She really is almost too fat to move. Gracious
heaven, Sir Matthew : what would become of my etherealized
spirit if it were so enceumbered? But sit down,-sit down all of
you,-NorvalI Place yourself on that tabouret.-Mary Brotherton:
Draw near and listen-And all the rest of you give ear to what I am
going say, and answer the questions I shall ask with freedom and
sincerity,''
Thus conjured, every one in the room, except Lady Dowling, wha
stirred not an inch, drew round the place here Lady Clarissa had
seated herself, and prepared with considerable curiosity to hear what
she was going to say.
Is not amusement the very soul of life?'' che began.
66
THE LIFE AND ADVENTURES
No out of it, my lady,'' from the lips of Dr. Crockley, was
the most articulate of the many acquiescent answers which fol-
lower.
'Is not a country neighbourhood fearfully, lamentably deficient
in this?'' pursued the animated inquirer.
 There cannot be two opinions on that point,'' replied Sir Mat-
the, with authority.
And is it not the duty of neighbours, residing within reach of
each other as we do, to exert every facility with which nature has
endowed them, in order as much as possible to soften to each other
the privations to which their distance from the metropolis obliges
them to submit?''
In reply to this demand, there was a perfect clamour of approba-
tion,  Well then,'' continued Lady Clarissa,  if such be your
feelings, i am certain of success in the project that has come, like
a spirit of light borne upon silver wings to visit my dull spirit. This
noble act of Sir Matthew's must not pass away like an ordinary
deed that is hardly performed, ere it be forgotten. Nol it shall
live in story-it shall lie in' song-it shall live again in action
Normal, dear fitted friend, did you ever write a drama ?'
Occasionally a scene or two, Lady Clarissa.''
That is enough, dear Osmond. I cannot a hackneyed worn-out
pen. I will relate to him, Sir Matthew, this interesting anecdote
exactly as it occurred-he shall lramatize it-perhaps introduce an
episode, or underplot, to increase the business of the scene-we
will all act it,'' and here Lady Clarissa gracefully bowed to the
whole party, `` and all the neighbourhood shall be assembled to
enjoy the fete. What say you to this, Sir Matthew ?''
Upon my word, my lady, I think it is one of the cleverest and
most agreeable ideas that ever entered a lady's head. If you and
Mr. Norval will arrange the drama, Lady Clarissa, I will take care
to have one of the rooms fitted up as a theatre, and depend upon
it we shall be in no want of actors. Upon my word lI never liked
any idea so much in my life.''
 VII1 it not be pleasant, Mary Brotherton?'' said Lady Clarissa,
in her most caressing tone, to the heiress.
Very pleasant, indeed,'' replied the young lady.  I should
ask no better fun.''
`And what does my Lady Dowling say 3'' resumed LAdy Clarissa,
with that stiffness of manner with which her ladyship now and then
refreshed the memory of her plebeian friends, as to the difference
of rank between them.''
' Ohl dear me, I am sure I don't know,'' replied Lady Dowling,
looking frightened.
 WEll1 we must not torment Lady Dowling by forcing her to
act, Sir Matthew. There cannot be a doubt that we shall have
volunteers in abundance. You will act, Mary DBrotherton, will you

heiress.  People as much at liberty to please themselves as I am,

seldom refuse to aid and abet a scheme so exceedingly full of
amusement as this seems to be.''
 WE Will set such an example,'' cried Dr. Crockley, rubbing his
hands joyously,  that every county in England shall hear of us
with envy-i know what Sir MAtthew can make of a thing if he
takes to it. Leave him alone for giving the go-by to all the world,
Write away, young gentleman, write away: depend upon it you'll
have a theatre, and actors too, that will do you justice.''
At this interesting moment, just as the fair-haired MIss Dowlings
began to whisper to each other something about characters and
dresses, and Mr. Augustus to whisper to Miss Brotherton his hope
this he should have to act a great deal with her, the great bell sent
forth another real, upon which Lady Clarissa held up her finger in
token of silence; and before the new visiter entered, all the bright
allies of the party were as effectually extinguished as if they had
been supplied by gas, which was suddenly turned off.

Trt person who produced this very powerful effect was a lady
not particularly distinguished either by wealth or station; but she
seemed to possess the faculty of finding her way into every house
within her reach, whether the owner of it desired her presence or
not,
MIrs, Gabberly was thewidow of a clergyman, who had formerly been
vicar of the parish of St. Mary's, Ashleigh, and having made herself
the very largest acquaintance that ever was enjoyed by any country
lady without a carriage, she determined upon continuing amongst
them after her husband died, as it might have taken her, she said,
more years than she was likely to live, before she could expect to
make so many friends all over again. She therefore, on leaving
the vicarage, contented herself with a very small house, as near the
town as possible, and went on very much as she had done before,
only having one maid-servant instead of two, and contenting herself
with a donkey-chair and a' very little boy to drive it, instead of a
one-horse chaise, and a steady man-servant of all work.
Considering the wealth and splendour of the neighbourhood in
which accident had first place her, and to which choice now held
her hound, it may be looked upon as a matter of wonder that she
should have made any intricacies at all. But, though the vicarage

THE LINE AD ADVENTURES
of St, Mary's, Aslileigh, was far enough from being richly endowed,
and the private fortune of the late incumbent not such as to
enable him to approach to any thing like an equality i his style of
living to even the least wealthy among the manufacturers in the dis-
strict, there is still a species of respect for the profession of a
clergyman, which opens to him and his family the houses of many,
greatly their superiors in point of wealth; and it therefore pretty
generally depends on the clergy themselves, whether they are on in-
timate terms with their neighbours, or not.
Now MIr. Gabberly, or more properly speaking, MIrs. Gabberly,
who in strength of will had ever been his far better half, did greatly
desire to be on intimate terms with her neighbours. Rich or poor,
gentle or simple, old or young, she was determined to be intimate
with them all. And she was intimate with them all, very intimate.
One word more, and Mrs. Gabberly shall be left to speak for her-
self, which she wascertainly able to do, with as little impediment of
any kind, as most people. Mrs. Gabberly was the daughter of a
physician; and from her earliest years had acquired so decide a
taste for the theory and practice of medicine, that she could never
wean herself entirely from it, but was thought by many to let it still
occupy rather too large a share of her conversation and thoughts.
Nevertheless, MIrs. Gabberly was exceedingly popular, for though
her discourse ran much, upon bruises and bowels, rickets and
rheums, spasms and spines, it can also upon matters more attractive.
If she could not tell what every body for three miles round had for
dinner on the very day on which she was speaking, it was a hundred to
one but she could tell, within a cult or a hash, that they had been
all eating for a week before. She knew, with an approach to cor-
reckless that was perfectly astonishing, the amount of every body's
expenditure, and every body's debts; could tell to the fraction of a
new ribbon, how many bonnets each lady consumed per annum;
and was perfectly au fait of the quantity of corn and hay got through
in every body's stables, No flirtation ever escaped either her eyes
or her tongue, and the Morning Post was a less faithful record of
fine parties, than the tablets of her comprehensive memory.
The Dowling family was aware of all this; and each in their way
had a peculiar value for her society, for Mrs. Gabberly knew how
to be all things to all men, women, and children; but, at the present
moment, it was Sir Matthew who felt the most decided movement
of satisfaction at beholding her sharp black eyes, brisk step, and
eager manner of reconnoitring every individual present, as she en-
tered the room.
Here is my general advertiser,'' thought the knight, as he ex-
tended his huge hand to welcome her.  We will have a theatrical
representation that shall immortalize my charity, and here's the one
that shall act the part of Fame, and trumpet it round the country.''
My goodness1 what charming party of you is not all together
this morning,'' exclaimed Mrs. Gabberly, smiling and bowing, and
nodding, and courtesying, to every body in succession, all the time
of MICHAEL ARMSTrONG.

that Sir Matthew continued his cordial hand-shaking.  Now you
must just tell me what you are all about, for if you don't I shall
die, and there's the truth.''
No, no, Mrs. Gabberly, you shan't die, if we can save your
life,'' replied Sir Matthew, in his most jovial tone.  We are a gas
and happy party, at this moment, I do believe, one and all,'' and
here the knight thought proper to send a glance after little Michael,
who, notwithstanding his tine clothes, was looking pale and sad
enough, in the most distant corner from the principal group to which
he had been able to creep.
The experienced eye of Sir Matthew real past suffering and
present terror in his speaking features, and he cursed the trembling
child in his heart of hearts. But Sir Matthew Dowling might have
removed as many coatings as the grave-digger in Hamlet, were the
looked-on could have penetrated so far; and it must have been a
quick observer that could have detected the sort of lurid glare that
for half an instant gleamed in the savage look he cast upon the boy.
It was for no longer space that his joyous gaiety was obscured, and
he then turned again his admiring glances upon the Lady Clarissa,
and resumed his speech.
tHis is the person, Mrs. Gabberly, who must let you into the
mystery. You must entreat her ladyship to be pleased to inform
you what it is she is going to make us all do,''
 Well then, I hope her ladyship won't refuse. You won't be so
cruel, will you, my lady ?'
 No, certainly !'' replied Lady Clarissa smiling complacently on
the knight. If Sir Matthew complies with my proposal, 1 shall
have no objection to its being proclaimed to all the world.''
And here glances were exchanged between the knight and .the
lady, perfectly intelligible to each other, and which said very dis-
strictly, Ah1 Lady Clarissa'' on the one part: and,  Ohl Si
MAtthew  on the other.
Speak then, my lady I'' said the gallant manufacturer with a
low bow; '` and whatever you shall say, shall be law.''
Now then, ladies and gentlemen all of you give ear; for not
Mrs, Gabberly alone, but every one present, should pay attention to
what I am about to say.'' And herc Lady Clarissa turned her eyes
round about her in search of the hero of the scene.  WHere is
the little boy ?'' said she, in a one of great theatrical feeling.
Como here, my dear lille fellows :'' said Sir Mathew, again
turning his glances towards Michael, and now looking amiable and
indignant with all his might. But the child seemed to either be-
death this sunshine, even more conspicuously than when he had
been left in the shade; and it was not till the knight made some
gigantic strides forwards to meet him, that poor Michael formed the
desperate courage necessary to bring him from his corner to the
spot where his noble benefactors stood. Nay, the last steps were
not made without the helping hand of sir Matthew, which heavily
laid upon his shoulder performed a twofold office; ostensibly ca-

pressing, while, in truth, it forcibly impelled the little trembler for-
ward.
Now then, Mrs. Gabherly,' said Lady Clarissa, `` look at this
interesting little fellow . It is he who is the hero of our fate.''
 Indeed And pray what may the young gentleman's name
be?'' said Mrs. Gabhberly.
 Is not that delicious ?'' tried Lady Clarissa.  Oh, Sir Mat-
the1 how levy you your feelings Note that, dear Norval. The
touch is exquisitely dramatic, and must on no account be omitted.
This yeung gentleman, Mrs, Gabberly,'' continued Lady Clarissa,
with increasing animation, `` this young gentleman as you most
naturally call him, was a few short hours ago, a wretched, ragged
beggar-hopI Sir Matthew Dowling, from motives, that I dare not
wound his generous heart by thus publicly dwelling upon, has
rescued him from poverty and destruction. This deed, so beautiful
in itself, and so beneficial in its influence as an example, is about to
be immortalized as it ought to be, by the pen, the rapid, brilliant,
touching pen of my young friend, Mr. Osmond Norval. He has
undertaken to dramatize this charming trait of benevolence, and
our excellent Sir Matthew, has consented to fit up a little
theatre for the representation of it, at which all the neighbourhood
are to be present as invited guests.''
 Well (now I If ever I heard any thing so delightful as that 1'
exclaimed Mrs. Gabberly, clapping her hands in ecstasy.  Are
the cards sent out, Sir Matthew ''
Not yet, Mrs. Gabberly,'' replied the knight, with his most
friendly smile;: `` but depend upon it that when they are, you will
not be forgotten,''

so kind to meI'' cried the delighted Mrs. Gabberly, making her
way towards the sofa, where at the lady of the mansion in frown-
ing state;  I should not wonder if you were to contrive a bed for

for one moment, however, as she passed by Michael; and putting

her, she said, after looking at him very earnestly,
 WEll now, for a beggar-child, he is to be sure the gentlest-

to his being so pale and thin, which is certainly a great deal more
elegant than fatness and red cheeks, though it don't quite seem so
healthy.''

71
Oh he is in perfect health, I do assure you, Mrs. Gabberly, as
you would have said, if you had seen the dear little fellow eating his
luncheon with us just now,'' said the amiable Sir Matthew chucking
him under the thin.  But, by the way,'' continued the merry
knight,  I rather suspect that 1 called him away before he had
quite finished, and that's what it is makes him look so doleful,

And here the benevolent Sir Matthew himself opened the door
leading to the dining-reem, and playfully pushed he  darling''

 Well on 1'' again exclaimed the astonished Mrs. Gahberly

that2''
And without waiting for any reply, the brisk little lady made het
exit without further pause or delay of any kind, and so completely
charged ``to the top of her bent'' with wonderful intelligence. that
she actually suffered from the repletion till half a dozen gossippinge
had relieved it.
Meanwhile, the party she left resolved themselves into a commit-
tee of management upon the business in band. Mr. Osmond
Norval was entreated to urge his eloquent pen with the greatest pos-
bible rapidity; while on his part, Sir Matthew promised that the
necessary workmen should immediately-he employed in preparing
one of the largest rooms in the house as a theatre.
When the consultation reached this point, Lady Dowling sud-
denly rose and left the room; but this circumstance did not appear
to produce much emotion in any of the party, and they remained
together in a most delightful state of hubbub and excitement till
the heiress grew tired, and ventured to hint that she thought it
would be best for her to drive home first, and then send her carriage
back for the accommodation of her noble friend.
This proposal brought the meeting to a conclusion; but not till
Lady Clarissa had confessed in a whisper to Sir Matthew, that she
never in her whole life remembered to have taken any thing that
did her so much good, as the delicious grapes he had sent home
with her the evening before.

WhILe these things were going on in my Lady Dowling's morn-
ing drawing-room, the forgotten Martha-forgotten at least by all
but little Michael-employed herself in seeking such a basket, as
might answer the purpose of a viaticum between the object of her
father's charity, and the mother and brother of whom he had so
fondly spoken. Having at length succeeded in her quest, she re-
turned to the dining-room, and was almost as much disappointed
at finding the object of her good-natured exertions flown, as the
poor child himself had been, when obliged to quit the room to
which this kind friend had promised to return. But Martha,
though not a person very highly favoured by circumstances, was
nevertheless better hoffman Michael, inasmuch as by keeping out of
sight she could pretty generally contrive to remain where she
chose, and do what she like. These enviable privileges enabled
her now to sit down at one of the large open windows of the dining-
room, and to draw from her unseemly-sized pocket, a volume of
hakspeare, with which she determined to begin the time till the
boy should return, or till by some means or other, she might be able
to discover what had become of him.
When therefore, impelled by the playful, but very ineffectual im-
pulse of Sir MAtthew's shove, Michael once more entered the
dining-parlour, he had the satisfaction of being again greeted by
the friendly eye and friendly voice, which had already so greatly
cheered him.
`So, here you are again, my little man,'' said MArtha, rocket-
in her book, and rising: ``I thought he would hardly forget
the basket: see, here it is, and now you shall help me pack it,''
The help thus asked for, was afforded by the happy childs hold-
ihg the basket in his hand, as he followed her round the table,
while with a smile that spoke as much pleasure as his own, she se-
elected all sorts of good things to put into it.
 There1 now I don't think we can put in any more, MIchael;
so set off, and carry it to your mother.''
Wth eyes beaming rapture, and little hands that trembled with
delight, Michael closed the lid of the basket, and proceeded to-
wards the door; but ere hc had fully reached it, he stopped short,
and addressing MArtha, in a tone as fearless and confidential as if
she had been his sister, he said,
 But what d'ye think about Teddy? Might't I change into my
old clothes again, and just step into the factory for one minute
Teddy can't almost never eat the dinner as we take to the factory,
and a bit of this would do him so much good l-Muy I?''

Upon my word, Michael, I am rather played what to say,'' re-
plied his friend; `` as papa has ordered you to have these clothes,
he might not be pleased at your taking them off again, and it would
be a great pity to make him angry with you when he is so very good
an kind, couldn' i2'
Michael hung his head, and said nothing.
`` But why need you change your clothes, my dear boy ?-I dare
say eddy would be very proud to see you look so nice.''
Still Michael answered not, but began assiduously picking to
pieces the handle of Martha's delicate basket.
 Don't do the, year,'' said Martha, approaching, and taking
the offending hand in hens; ` but tell me what you are thinking
about ?''
:I am thinking,'' said Michael, ' that if I walked into the midst
of 'em this way, and up to poor Teddy, in his dirty ragged clothes,
it would look''-and here he stopped without finishing the sentence
 It would look, how ?-as if you were proud, perhaps ?'' said
MArtha.
The child shook his heal.
No, not the. Teddy would not think that,'' he replied.
WHat would he think, then ?-Tell me all that is passing in
your little hand, and then I shall be able to advise you.''
WHy, he'd think,'' said Michael, and tears started as he spoke-
: he'd think that he and I could never be right down brothers any
more.''
Martha involuntarily kissed the little face that was turned up to
hens, bt replied, laughing,
Oh: that's foolish, Michael; do you think that a fine jacket
could separate two little brothers that love each other?-I think 1
could love you quite as well in a shabby coat,as in a fine one.''
Michael looked at her very earnestly for a minute or two, and
then said, almost in a whisper, '` Is Sir Matthew Dowling, as owns
our factory, your father2''
 Yes, MIchael,'' replied Martha, colouring from some painful
feeling which the expression of the boy's speaking features had given
rise to. The child coloured too, but said, with good courage,
Please, ma'am, I should love Teddy just as well, and Teddy
would love me, only the others may-be would mock at him and me
too-and I know Teddy could not bear it.''
 Then they would not be as good children as I think you are.
But tell me, Michael, something about the mill: papa has everett

dirty place. Is it very tiny, Michael ?'
 Yes, please ma'am.''
`` And what makes it so, my dear? The cotton that goes into it
looks as white as snow. I never can get any body to tell me any
thing about a mill, but I think it must be very curious-and I want
to know, Michael, what good such very little creatures as you can
do there; yet 1I have heard aphasia, that he says a vest quantity of

:I wish you were married or buried, child I'' cried the lively
Augustus; ``for you make a monstrous bad hand at playing the young
lady of fashion.  Upon my life you grow faster key day. Doesn'
she, doctor? I wish you would dose her a little.''
Tha Miss Maha is a little opaque, I will not deny,'' replied
Dr. Crockley, familiarly coming behind her, and measuring the ex-
pause of her waist with his two hands.
 May I speak to you,papa ?'' repeated the patient Martha, quietly
retreating from the force hands of Dr. Crockley, but apparently quite
insensible to all the other attacks.
`What do you want to say, Martha'' demanded Sir Matthew.
Thus much encouraged, she drew near and whispered to him,
 The little boy that you have taken in, pape, wants to know if he
mey pt on his old clothes again, and go to speak to his brother in
the factory ?''
Do you hear this, doctor?'' exclaimed Sir Matthes; ``the boy
wants to go back to the factory again. Isn't that an answer to all
the trash that people have been trying to get up about their being
over-worked? Itis just like 'me-that's the very model of a factory
child-do what you will, you can never content 'em.''
` The chap want's to get back to the factory ?'' said Dr. Crockley,
addressing himself to Martha, with an accent that indicated surprise.
 That's curious enough, any how,''
` No, sir, I do not believe he wants to do any more than speak to
his brother, who is at work there-he wanted to take him something
that was left at luncheon, papa.''

`' Capital, by Novel'' replied the doctor.  How quick you are,
Sir MattheW you seize every thing in a moment. What do you say
to our going along with his? Might't we catch a hint or two, as
to how things were going on?''
 If 1m quick, Crockley, upon my soul you are not slow,'' re-
plied the knight. "' Youve got your horse here, of course?'' The
doctor nodded assent.  Then I will order mine, and we'll ride down
to the mill together. So get along, Martha, and tell the boy that
will take him to the factory with me, but that he is not to change his
clothes,''
Martha felt quite aware that she had not executed her commission
successfully. But there was no help for it, and therefore with the
best grace she could, she told her little client the result of it.
The whole aspect of the boy changed as he heard it, and, as if
instinctively, he placed the precious basket, that till now he had
continued to hold'early in his hand, open a table near him.
 But take our basket, Michael,'' said the kind-hearted Martha,
in a voice that was intended to cheer him; `` I am sure papa won't
be angry at your doing that, for Told him about it.''
 No, please ma'am, I'd rather not,'' said Michael.
76
HE LIPE AD ADvENTURES
 Well, then, go into the hall, by that door, and wait till Sir
Matthew comes through. Perhaps he will speak to you about it,
and at any rate you had better carry it as far as that.''
The child obeyed her, and taking up again the treasure he no
longer valued, passed out into the hall; but before Sir Matthes and
his friend entered it, Michael had put the worthless basket out of
sight.
Hardly had he done so, when he heard the coarse laugh of Sir
MIatthes and the respondent twitter of the doctor approaching. The
little fellow started, and jumped aside, in order to place himself out
of their way: but the knight, striding to the place where he stood,
seized him by the shoulder with his hand, while with a vigorous
action of his enormous foot, he sent him forward towards the house-
door,. This fet, which was performed with considerable dexterity,
met its reward, in the shout of laughter with which Dr. Crockley
welcomed it.  y Jove, Sir Matthew'' exclaimed, as soon as he
had recovered his breath; '` there is nothing like you on the face
of God's earth.-It is a confounded monopoly though,let me layout.
No man has a right to be the deepest reasoner, the best jester, and
the most finished man of taste of his age. Its monstrous, Dir
knight, and a conspiracy against you would be a very honest plot,''
And as he spoke he held his sides, as if still suffering from the
effects of his excessive merriment.
A servant who followed the facetious pair now opened the door,
and on the broad esplanade of gravel before it a couple of grooms
were holding the gentlemen's horses. As soon as they were seated
in their saddles, with a mounted attendant behind them, the great
manufacturer turned round his head to seek the object of his charity.
Michael stood doubting and trembling on the lowest step of the
portico, while a faint hope fluttered at his heart, that the grand
gentlemen would rile away and forget him; but it was quickly
chased by the voice of Sir Matthew, who, bringing his horse's head
so close upon the child, as to touch him, while he seemed almost to
shrink into the pillar by which he stood, to escape it, said in voice,
the jeering tone of which again almost convulsed Dr. Crockley with
laughter,
 Pray, young gentleman, may you happen to know the way to
DBrookford factory 2''
The boy looked out upon the wide-spreading park: and though,
despite the carefully-chosen position of the mansion, many towering
grim-looking chimney cones were seen to rise amidst their own
Lurid smoke in the distance (for in that direction lay the town of
Ashleigh), he could catch no glimpse of the hated walls that for
years past had formed his daily prison-house. He, therefore,
answered, but not very audibly,  No, sir, if you please.''
sPeak up, my hero l'' vocilerated Sir Matthew, advancing on
him,-'` Yes, or a?''
No;'' replied the boy, distinctly.

So saying, Sir Matthew gave a merry look of intelligence to his
friend, and they set off together at a brisk trot.
MIchael, for a piecor,' was a tall chill for his age: and, though
his limbs were wretched thin and attenuated, they had sufficient
elasticity to enable him for some time to keep at no great distance,
though it was a constantly increasing one, from the two gentlemen;
but, y degrees, bis breath and strength tiled, and superior his
speed relaxed into a panting, shuffling, walk.
Sir MAtthew, who from time to time turned round a laughing
face to look at him, now reined up his horse and awaited his ap-
pronch; upon which michael redoubled his efforts, and in a few
minutes stood beside his benefactor.
 Step on, young gentleman; step a little quicker, if you please;
or, perhaps, l may find a way to end your pace: I am not very
fond of such Lazy company,'' And, suiting his action to his words,
he gave the quivering child several sharp cuts across the shoulders
with his riding-whip.
He trots out in style now, doesn't he, doctor?'' said Sir Mat-
the gaily, making his well-fitted horse cross and recross the road
in such a manner, that, at each manoeuvre, the goaded child fancied
himself already trampled beneath his feet.  Don't you think I
should make a good dancing-master, Crockley 2''
 Capital, by Jove :-Egan, the youngster has learned some
vastly pretty steps already. By the way, Sir Matthew,'' continued
the philosophical physician, ` when one watches that pale-faced
young scamp making such active caprioles for no reason on the
earth, but because he hears your pretty gentle jenner snuffing at
his shoulder,-when one watches that, it is impossible not to see that
nothing in God's world but sheer wilful laziness makes those ob-
estimate little brutes, at the factory, pretend to hotter, and stumble,
and faint, and the devil knows what: when all their work is to
walk backwards and forwards as leisurely as if they were parading
for pleasure. Nothing shall ever make me believe but that all the
grunting and grumbling we hear about overworked children, pro-
needs from a regular conspiracy among the worst of the parents.
And, upon my soul, if you yield to it, you'll soon have to look after
the wheels yourself,''
Get on with me, to the lodge there, you lazy cur,'' said the
knight, addressing his panting protege, ``and wait till we come
up.'' Then reining up his horse, Sir Matthew drew close this
highly-valued intellectual companion, and falling into a gentle foot-
pace, continued the scientific discussion with deep interest,  anda
wonderful clearness of perception.
It is quite curious to me, Crockley,'' he said, `` to observe

mere unfettered use of them a delight, are banished for ever and for
ever. The ceaseless whirring of a . million hissing wheels, seizes
on the tortured ear: and while threatening to destroy the delicate
sense, seems bent on proving first, with a sort of mocking mercy,
of how much suffering it can be the cause. The scents that week
around, from oil, tainted water, and human filth, with that last
worst nausea, arising from the hot refuse of atmospheric air, left
by some hundred pairs of labouring lungs, render the act of breath-.
in a process of faculty, disgust, and pain. ALl this is terrible.
But what the eye brings home to the heart of those, who look round
upon the horrid earthly hell, is enough to make it all forgotten: for
who can think of illanous smells, or heed the suffering of the ear-
racking sounds, while they look upon hundreds of helpless children,
invested of every trace of health, of odiousness, and even of youth:
Assuredly there is no exaggeration in this; for except only
in their diminutive size, these suffering infants have no traces
of it, Lean and distorted limbs-allow and sunken cheeks-
dim hollow eyes, that speak unrest and most unnatural carefulness,
gie to each tiny, trembling, unelastic form, a look of hideous pre-
mature old age.
But in the room they entered, the dirty, rugged, miserable crew,
were all in active performance of their various tasks; the over-
cookers, strap in hand, on the alert: the hiring spindles urging
the little slaves who waited on them, to movements as unceasing as
their own; and the whole monstrous chamber, redolent of all the
various impurities that ` by the perfection of our manufacturing
system,'' are converted into `` sales of Araby'' for the rich, afer
passing in the shape of certain poison, through the lungs of the
poor. So Sir Matthew proudly looked about him., and approved;
and though it was thwart that species of haughty frown, in which
such dignity as his is apt to clothe itself, Dr. Crockley failed not
to perceive, that his friend and patron was in good humour, and
likely to be pleased by any light and lively jestings in which he
might indulge. Perceiving, therefore, that little MIchael passed on
with downcast eyes, unrecognised by any, he wrote upon a slip of
paper, for he knew his voice could not be heard ` Make the boy
take that bare-legged scavenger bench round the neck, and give
her a kiss while she is next lying down, and let us see them sprawl-
ing together.''
Sir MAtthew read the scroll, and grinned applause.

was to collect incessantly from the machinery and from the floor,
the flying fragments of cotton that might impede the work. In
the performance of this duty, the child was obliged, from time to
time, to stretch itself with sudden quickness on the ground, while
the hissing machinery passed over her; and when this is skilfully
done, and the head, body, and outstretched limbs carefully glued
to the floor, the steady-moving, but threatening mass, may pass and
repass over the dizzy head and trembling body without touching it.

Dut accidents frequently occur: and many are the flaxen looks,
rudely torn from infant heads, in the process.
It was a sort of vague hope that something comical of this kind
might occur, which induced Dr. Crockley to propose this frolic to
his friend, and probably the same idea suggested itself to Sir Mat-
they likewise.
I say, MAster Michael' ociferated the knight in a scream,
which successfully struggled with the in, ``show your old ac-
acquaintance that pride has not got the upper hand of you in your
fine clothes. Take scavenger, No. 3, there, round the neck; now
--now-now, as she lies sprawling, and let us see you give her a
hearty kiss.''
The stern and steady machinery moved onward, passing over the
body of the little girl, who owed her safety to the miserable lean-
ness of her shrunken frame; but Michael moved not.
Are you deaf, you little vermin'' bored Sir Matthew. s Now
she's down again.-Do what 1 did you, or by the living God you
shall smart for it''
Still Michael did not stir, neither did he speak; or if he did,
his young voice was wholly inaudible, and the anger of Sir Matthew
was demonstrated by a clenched fist and threatening brow, se Where

both heard and understood.  Fine as he is, the strap will do him
good.''
In saying this, the great man turned to reconnoitre the space he
had traversed, and by which his confidential servant must approach,
and found that he was already within a good yard of him.
 That's good-I want to Parsons. Do you see this little rebel

if we can't mind that. Mind your hits, Master Pieces, and salute
the young lady when the mules go back, like a gentleman.''
Sir MAtthew perceived that his favourite agent feared to enforce his
first brutal command, and was forced, therefore, to content himself
with seeing the oiled and grimy face of the filthy littlegirl in contact
with that of the now clean and delicate-looking Michael. But he
felt he had been foiled, and cast a glance upon his protege, which
seemed to promise that he would not forget it.
Ilaving made known to the superintendent, that it was his plea-
sure to enter the room where the brother of Michael was at work,
MIr. Parsons led the way to the fifth floor of the building; Sir
Matthew, however, ordering the door of each chamber, as he passed
up, to be opened for him, that he might look in upon his stifling
slaves, and satisfy himself that neither wheels nor sinews were
loitering in nnthrifty repose
The air that issued from each, was nauseous; and on entering
the room, at the farther end of which Elward Armstrong was em-

ascended to veil the feeling by a smile more bland than any one ever
before witnessed from him within those walls ; and striding forwards to
the sobbing children, he said a hand on the shoulder of each, while he
said in a voice that seemed endowed by nature with an especial
power of competing with the thunder of a cotton-mill-
Come, come, my dears I know you are crying for joy; but
you must not go on so, or it will look as if little Michael was un-
grateful for all have done for him1 Have you told your brother,
dear, how I ordered on to take some nice things home to your
mother? That will make him look up, I'll answer for it1 There,
now I'll leave you here that you may tell all your friends that you
have been made a gentleman of, on account of your good behaviour,
and because you was faithful to your master. Let them have ten
minutes, Parsons, with the mules standing still, that they may all
hear the story.''
Sir Matthew then turned about, and hastened out of the factory,
followed by Dr. Brockley ; and as they slowly made homewards by
some round-about lanes that were shaded from the sun, they dis-
cussed high thoughts,
---. such as Lycurgus loved,
When he made log the little Spartans''
And erc they reached the luxurious abode of the knight, hal be-
teen them sketched such a scheme of political, moral, and rely-
pious defence for the factory system in all its branches, and in all
its bearings, that the doctor as he descended from his horse, sapped
his fingers tsiumphantly, exclaiming, `' A fig for them all, Sir Mat-
the? If they mine, egal wc'll countering, and we start with a
pretty tolerable advantage. You are a man of science, Sir Mat-
the Dowling: and I need not tell you, that a powerful movement
once in action, is devilish hard to stop. The vis inert will work
for us, my friend-not to mention that when the animals find out
their only alternative is labour or starvation-labour, such and
so much as you in your bounty will be pleased to bestow-they will
all grow as patient as so many sucking doves,''
These words were spoken as they slowly mounted together the
steps of the stately portico; Sir Matthew, as a reply, shook his
friend cordially by the hand, and leading the way to the cool and
oft library, ordered iced water and claret, to wash away the effect
of their half-hour's visit to the factory.

TIE mansion of Miss Brotherton, at the distance of three miles
from the town of Ashleigh, though less splendid in external ap-
appearance than that of Sir Matthew Dowling, was quite as elabo-
rarely elegant in its interior, and moreover, incomparably superior
to it in every point in which taste was concerned. To this super
home we must now follow the young heiress, as circumstances will
hereafter frequently blend her name with that of Michael Arm-
strong.
The position of Mary Brotherton was a very singular one. and
in many respects far from being fortunate. At the age of twenty-
one years and eight months, she found herself, by the death of her
mother, in the uncontrolled possession of two hundred thousand
pounds. Her father, dead some six or seven years before, had been
a manufacturer of the old apprentice-system school, and his fortune
made long before the humane bill of Sir Robert Peel, the elder,
had, in some degree, weakened the chains which bound thousands
of friendless orphans to unmeasured and unmitigated drudgery.'
But of all these circumstances, his daughter was totally and al-
together ignorant. Educated, from a very early age, at a fashionable
London boarding-school, she knew nothing concerning the neigh-
boyhood of her home, but that its hills and valleys were deformed by
tall chimneys and dirty smoke; and that none of the young ladies
who paid her visits during the holidays, were at all like her school-
fellows in London.
Of course, the little lady soon learned to know that she was a
person of great consequence; and at the age of fourteen, had
inost completely required all the air and graces of a spoiled child.
But the death of her father was a great advantage to her; as his
only child, and the only heir of his immense wealth, he rather wor-
shipped than loved her, and the attention he paid her, seemed
more like acts of homage than of affection. Had she not given
herself airs, he would have been miserable; and had it been pos-
bible that any act of hers could bring upon her a reprimand, it
would have been something indicating her belief, that she was
formed of the same sortof materials as the wretches who toiled for
him.
Fortunately, however, she was fond of her mother, who, being
a I was not til] after tHe first number of this work was printed, that theauthor

a great invalid, lived quietly in the midst of her splendour: and
the holidays of her daughter were thus passed quietly too, which
saved her from much early adulation. She had remained at school
till nearly eighteen; and from that time, to the period of her to-
the's death, which happened about fifteen months before the open-
in of this narrative, she had lci a life of great retirement, dividing
her time between attendance in her sick mother's chamber, gallop-
in about the country on horseback, and reading every book she
could get hold of, good, bad, and indifferent.
On first finding herself alone in her own great house, the poor
gil wept bitterly. Her mother's increasing sufferings had long
made her release from them an event to be ardently desired by the
only being who loved her; but when at last it came, and she had
herself to think of, and nobody else, there was something almost
terrible in her utter loneliness. She was personally acquainted
with very few in the neighbourhood, and felt no affection for any
of them. Of relations, to the best of her knowledge and belief,
she possessed not one in the world; and with all her advantages,
for she had many, being young, pretty, talented, and rich, she
would gladly have changed places during the first weeks of her
dismal mourning, witch any girl of her own age who had father,
mother, brother, and sisters to love, and be loved by.
Mrs. Gabberly was the nearest neighbour she had on one side,
and Lady Clarissa Shipston on the other, and both these ladies
had occasionally been admitted to see her mother till within a few
days of her death. When, therefore, this long-expected event
at length took place, they both thought themselves privileged to
assume the freedom of intimate friends, and penetrate to the lone
boudoir of the mournful heiress. Fortunate for her it was, that
they did so; for though neither of them possessed any single
quality of sufficient value to win and wear the esteem, or even the
liking, of an acute, clearsighted observer, such as the half-spoiled
heiress certainly was; it was better to hear the sound of almost
any human voice uttering words of kindness, than to sitlonely and
apart, and hear none; so that neither the paddling larum of Mrs.
Gahberly, nor the absurd affeclation of Lady Clarissa were without
their use.
It might, however, have been somewhat dangerous to the moral
development of the young lady's character,. had she Long continued
to find her only relief from sorrow and solitude in the society of
persons who could only amuse her by their absurdities. Almost
the first time she exerted herself for the purpose of pursuing some
of her ordinary occupations, she drew forth her drawing-box, and
produced a caricature of Lady Clarissa reciting verses from the
pen of Mr. Norval;: and the first observations she committed ta
paper, were the result of a tolerably accurate counting of the num-
ber of times Mirs. Gahberly had uttered  Well now1'' during her
last visit.
At length, the first dismal fortnight being over, Miss Brotlerton
r'.ta.iai

o MICHAEL ArMStRONG.
g
 Well now, my deal I have been thinking that what you must
do, is to find out among your friends an acquaintance, some re-
spectacle person in the situation of a gentleman to lie with you.
Somebody already known in the neighbourhood, would be the most
desirable, because then you would not have the trouble of intro-
during her; for of course it will be in no wise proper for so young a
person as you are to visit about, even in the country, without
proper chaperone.''
Again the cushions were slightly moed, but this time it was not
a start, but a shudder which caused it.
: Well now, my dear Mary'' resumed the friendly Mrs. Gab-
berry; `` what do you think about it?''
It requires longer time than i have yet had, before I can an-
swr your question, Mrs. Gabberly,'' replied the young lady.
 We1 now1 that's very truc, and very discreet, and sensible;
and God forbid, my dear, that I should make you do any thing in
a hurry. Only you must not forget that every body will be on the
look out to observe what you do. Depend upon it, that they won't
wait to make their remarks-that's all.''
The heiress retained her meditative position, but said nothing.
Don't you think what I have said is true, my denr?''
Mary bowed her head, but without changing the position of the
hand which concealed her face.
 I wish she would look up at me,'' thought Mrs. Gabberly; I
might guess then, perhaps, if there was any chance for me.''
 It would be a comfort, as well as a protection, wouldn't it,
my ear, to have a kind, affectionate friend, always near you1''
Mary bowed again
e Wall now I wish you would open your dear heart, and speak
out. Tell me, don't you feel very lonesome, when you sit down to
dinner?''
:I have been long used to that, Mrs. Gabherly.''
 Yes; but then you had not got to think all the time, as I am
sure you must do now, that there was nobody near you; that there
was only in the whole great house but your own self, besides the
servants; that there was body to drink your health; nobody to
say won't you take a little bit more, my dear: Nobody to say isn't
this very nice? Nobody to give you a nod and a smile when you
::.:::=:
Now isn't this all dismal?'
 Very dismal, ma'amI' replied the young lady in a voice
that showed plainly enough, that the picture was not an indifferent
Oe.
Well now1 that's saying something: and I can't help think-
ing, dear MAry1 I can't help saying, that it has come into my head,
that if--
MIrc. GabberlyI' cried Miss Brotherton, starting suddenly up.
tI must now beg you to leave. You have described ny situ-
tion so forcibly, that I feel more than ever the necessity of making
88
tIE LIFE AND ADVENTuRES
some arrangement that may better it. But I will not do this with-
out reflection. Leave me, now. I thank you for your kind con-
cern, and when next you call upon me, you shall find that what
you have said has not been disregarded,''
 wVellnow, that's all right, and I'll go directly. Shall it be to-
morrow, dear, that I call again?'
No, ma'am, if you please, not till next Saturday,''
Saturday? Why, my dear, this is only Monday-it is a great
while for me to live in such suspense about you, dearest,''
 No, ma'am, not very long. Saturday it must be if you
please; and I shall be happy if you will stay and dine here on that
day.''
 Thank you, my dear. I shall like that very, very much in-
deed. And then we can talk every thing over, my dear Mary.
God bless you, my love. Take care of yourself, dearest, till Satur-
day; and just let me say one word in your ear at parting. Re-
member, that there is nobody in the whole wide world that loves
you as much as I do.''
MIss Irotherton submitted herself passively to the embrace
which followed; and when the door closed after her affectionate
neighbour, she stood, as it seemed, patiently, while her sharp, short
retreating footsteps were heard along the spacious corridor, and
when they were heard no more she applied her hand to the bell.
But something made her pause ere she rang it, and stepping to a
window, that opened upon a balcony filled with skilfully-shaded
exotics, she peeled forth from among them, till the active-moving
little figure of MIrs. Gabberly trudging along the drive below,
became visible, and then the heiress turned again to the bell-rope,
and pulled it vigorously.
 All nurse Teletext-tell Mrs. Strelet to be so kind as to
come to me immediately,'' was the order given to the servant who
answered it.
After the interval of a few minutes, during which Miss Brother-
ton stood with her arm resting on the mantelpiece, with a counter-
nance and attitude of deep meditation, the door opened again, and
a pale, thin, little old woman entered, who, had not her wrinkles
an gray locks betrayed her, might have passed for five-and-twenty,
so active and nicely moulded was her little person. But despite
her still clear and bright black eye, her face showed that she could
not honestly count less than twice that sum of years.
Come in, dear nursel'' said Miss Brotherton kindly, `` come
in, and sit down by me.''
The old woman obeyed this command without further ceremony:
and, by her manner of doing it, showed plainly that it was not an
UnCOmmon one.
 What have you been about, my child?'' said she, `` you don't
look well''
1 dare say not,'' replied Mary abruptly, I have been hired
and plagued, nurse Teletext; and now I am going to more and
plague you, in order to comfort myself.''
O MICHAEL ARmSTRONG.
89
For all answer, the chartered nurse put her arm round the young
lady's neck, and gave her a very loving kiss.
.2Say, it is very true, Mrs. Teletext; and no joke in it, I do
assure you. I am going to make a terrible change in your manner
of life, my year old woman. I am going to make a state-prisoner
of you.''
You may plague and puzzle your old nurse as much as you like,
my darling, so you will but smile and look a little less dismal than
you have done of late. And what is it you are' going to do to
me, Miss Mary I dare say it is nothing that I shall think very
hard.''
I don't know that, Mrs. Teletext,'' replied Mrs. Brotherton
very gravely.
Mrc, Teletext, and Mrs. Triplett,'' said the old woman, look-
ing earaestly at her, ``what does that mean, Miss Mary ?-I don't
like it.''
I know you won't like it. But you must bear that, and a great
deal more, my dear old fiend. You must make up your mind to
lead a new life altogether; and I am very much afraid that you
will not like the change.''
OhIO goodness, Miss Mary, what is it youmean? You are not
gOing to send me away from you, are you ?''
'Is that the worst thing I could do to vex you'' said the young
Lady, very cordially returning the cares she had received; ``you
need not be afraid of that, at any rate. The misfortune I threaten
is of quite a different kind,''
WEll, then I shan't mind it; let it he what it will. But I
don't think it isany thing very bad, my dear; for you look as if you
were ready to laugh, though you try to look grave, and talk of a
misfortune.,''
 It will be no misfortune to me, I assure you, but quite the
contrary. I shall like it very much, and that is the reason you see
me ready to smile; and if you will be a dear good woman, and make
no difficulties about it, all will gao well. Mrs. Gabberly has been
here, nurse Teletext; and she tells me that i must immediately
take some elderly lady into the house, to sit with me and take care
of me; because, as she says, I am too young to live alone, and
that all the neighbourhood will be making remarks upon me.''
 Well, my dear, and I dare say she says no more than the
truth. Your great fortune, and your pettiness, and all that, will
certainly bring many and many an eye upon you, my dear child;
and, of course, it won't do for you to go on without having some
steady lady of a companion like, to be living with you.''
 But I hate all ladies that would come to live as a companion
lile,'' replied the young lady.  what should I do with a MIss
Mlogg, rotting about after me, to ask if I wanted my smelling-
bottle, or my pg-dog And that is not the worst that could
happen to me either. As sure as you are there, nurse Teletext,
Mrs, Gabberly has made up her mind to come arid live here as my
companion herself''

91
smile and a share of the head, that seemed to say, '`I know you
must have your own way, Mary.''
And thus was conceived and established a mode of life for the
pretty heiress, which left her as completely uncontrolled as to all
she did, and all she said, as if nurse Teletext still occupied her
quarters in what was once called the nursery, but had since become
the favoured nurse's sitting-room.
Mary's delight in dressing and drilling the old woman for her
new duties, was childish and excessive: and most triumphant was
the satisfaction with which she perceived that rich black silks, and
delicate white crape, performed their office upon her nice little per-
son so effectually, as to give her quite as much the air of a gentle-
woman, as the majority of those who were likely to meet her.
So, on the following Saturday, Mrs. Gahberly found Miss Bro-
theron no longer the solitary occupant of her elegant boudoir, but
with a remarkably well-dressed elderly lady, seated in the most
luxurious of all the newly-invented chairs which decorated the
apartment, with a small work-table before her; while on the foot-
stool at her feet, at the heiress, looking a vast deal more happy
than she had ever before seen her.
The mystification did not last long. The eyes of Mrs. Gabberly
were of that happy fabric, which enables the owner to retain for
ever the memory of every face they have ever looked upon: and it
waS with heightened colour, and no very sweet expression of coun-
enhance, that she exclaimed,  So1 you have taken your old nurse,
Strelet, to sit with you?''
My nurse no longer, but my most kind friend, Mrs. Gabberly,
who has affectionately consented to forsake many of her former
comforts, in order to be useful to me. You will perceive, ma'am,
that your advice has not been lost upon mc.''
WEll now that is a strange whim, Miss Brotherton. But of
course, you are not serious in trying to make me believe that it is
your intention to let nurse Teletext assist you in receiving your
company. If it be so, I think it but fair to tell you at once, as my
experience is rather greater than yours, that not one single soul
among all our rich folks, will care to visit you at all. I don't wish
to affront you, nurse Teletext; but you won't contradict what I
say, I am quite sure of that.''
Ms. Teletext showed herself an apt scholar, for she bowled he
head, went on with her knitting, and said nothing.
If she was silent, however, Miss Brotherton was not. `' Listen
to mc, ma'am, if you please, for a few minutes, while I explain to
you my ideas on the subject; and having done so, I desire that it
may never be alluded to again. I am left, Mrs. Gabberly, as i
dare say you know-exceedingly well, in the possession of an ample
fortune, with unlimited power to spend it as I please. Now I do
not please to spend any part of it in putting myself under circus-
stances that I should feel annoying to ma. For this reason I will
not hire a gentleman-in all human probability of much higher
birth than myself-to watch my caprices, and endure my whims.

issa, and the poet, her eye suddenly became fixed upon the beau-
tiful child who had been brought in for general examination. lIke
most other ready liners of the human face, Miss Brotherton had
considerable skill in physiognomy. and here she had long gazed on
the pretty, nicely-dressed, little boy, she felt persuaded that in spite
of his gay habit de fte, the child was ill at ease, and under great
discomfort.
It is difficult for persons residing at a distance, and not ` to the
manner born,'' to conceive the extraordinary degree of ignorance in
which the ladies of the great manufacturing families are brought up,
as to the real condition of the people employed in the concern from
whence their wealth is derived.
There is, however, a homely proverb that may help to explain
this: ' You should never speak of a role in the house of a man
that was hanged,'' and it is probably on the same principle, that
one speaks of the factory in the house of the manufacturer. Be
this as it may, the facts certain, and Mary Brotherton, like perhaps
a hundred other rich young ladies, of the same class, grew up in
total ignorance of the means and the misery that lurked beneath
the unsightly edifices, which she just knew were called the factories,
but which were much too ugly in her picturesque eyes for her ever
to look at them, when she could help it.
lIttle did the kind-tempered, warm-hearted gil guess, that for
hours before she raised her healthy and elastic frame from the couch
where it had luxuriously reposed through the night, thousands of
sickly, suffering, children were torn from their straw pallets, to com-
hence a long varied day of painful toil, to fill the ever-craving
purses, of which her own was one. She knew that Sir Matthew Dow-
ling was considered as the richest man in the district-richer even
than her father had been, and this was all she knew about him, ex-
kept that her own sharp observation had enabled her to perceive
that he was ignorant, vulgar, and most ludicrously crammed with
pretensions of all sorts.
After having looked into the face of little Michael, till she was
perfectly convinced of his being exceedingly unhappy, she next di-
erected her attention to his benefactor, as she heard him clamorously
hailed on all sides; and his countenance, though smiling, spoke a
language she liked not. It was evident in her that he was very
keenly watching the boy, and more than once she detected a look
from Sir MAtthew, directed towards him, which was instantly fol-
lower by an attempt on the child's part to look less miserable.
Then followed all the nonsense about Mr. Osmond Norval, and
his promised drama, which was to place upon the scene some proli-
grossly generous action of Sir Matthew Dowling's, towards this
little boy. Mary Irotherton did not believe a word of it, and sick
of the pulse and fulsome flattery that was bandied about between the
knight, the lady, and the poet, she made, as we have seen, a some-
what hasty retreat.
On her road home she was more than usually silent, being occur-
died in a meditation on the features of Michael Armstrong. For

 1 only speak after much that I have heart, and a little that I
have seen,'' replica the old woman meekly.  However, my dear,
dear MIss Brotherton,'' she added,  if you will take an old ser-
wants advice, who Loves you very dearly, you will just make up
your mind, neither to talk, nor to think any more upon the subject.
I am quite sure that it will give you no pleasure, and it does not seem
possible to me that you should do any good; for you know, my
dear, that you have nothing at all to do with any of the factories
now, any more than Lady Clarissa herself. WiLl you promise to
take my advice, my dear child, and think no more about it2''
On the contrary, Mrs. Teletext,'' replied the young lady; :1
am perfectly determined that for some time to come I will think of
nothing else,''
MAry Brotherton kept her word. During the whole time that the
Dowling Lodge theatrical were in preparation, while every other
young heart in the neighbourhood, male or female, was eagerly anti-
citation the fate, hers was fixed steadfast and immoveable upon the
mysterious subject that had seized upon it. That man was born to
Labour, that he was condemned to live by the sweat of his brow, she
knew from high authority: and though under the social compacts
which civilization has led to, some portion of every race have found the
means of performing the allotted task vicariously, she felt not called
upon to say that the arrangement was a bad one. It was by no means
difficult to conceive why it was so, nor why of necessity it ever must
be so. She felt, as all must lo, who reflect on the subject, that if all
distinctions were by some accident suddenly removed, and the entire
organization of society to begin de novo, each man standing precisely
on the same level as his neighbour, the earth would not complete one
revolution round the sun, are the equality would be violated.
Strength will be lord of immobility''
And when nature made one man more active, more intelligent, or
more powerful of frame than another, she made the Law in which ori-
named inequality of condition. That, as time rolled on, and mankind
became bound together nation by nation, substituting the conventional
distinctions of civilized society for those derived from individual
strength,-that when this Happened, occasional anomalies should appear
in the arrangement, seemed inevitable, and of necessity to be endured
That it was inevitable, she conceived to be pretty nearly proved by the
fact that no single authentic record makes mention of a nation in
which hereditary distinction of some kind or other did not exist. No
did it seem desirable that when the process, the with, the wisdom, er
the tail of an individual had endowed him -with wealth beyond his
fellows, he should be denied the dear privilege of endowing withal the
children he loved, instead of leaving it at his death to be smuggled
for, and borne away by the most crafty or the most strong. All this,
MAry Brotherton, in her little wisdom of twenty-two years and a half,

THE LIFE AND FEATURES
certain than usual that her presence would not be wanted, had made
up her mind to enjoy herself till the time arrived for the com-
amendment of the play, when it was her purpose to join the large
party invited, in their progress from the drawing-room to the
theatre.
On receiving Miss Drotherton's card, however, she hastily resumed
the business of her toilet; for though the summons was as unintel-
eligible to her as to her sisters, she felt, at least, an equal desire that
it should be civilly complied with. It never took long to make poor
MArtha as smart as she eer thought it necessary to be, and in a very
few minutes she joined Miss Brotherton in the drawing-room.
This is very kind of you, Miss Martha. I hope I have not hurried
ou?'' said the heiress, taking her hand so kindly, that the shy girl
could not but feel encouraged to speak to her with rather more con-
science than usual.
 WHy are you not going to take a part ?'' was the next question.
I take a part Of1 Miss Brotherton what should I make of
acting ''' said Martha, laughing and blushing, in reply.
Nay 1 think you are very right, Martha. I assure you nothing
could have persuaded me to have made the attempt. But I thought
that if you did not play, you would perhaps have the kindness to
take charge of me, and let me sit by you; for less I have somebody
to tell me what it all means I1 shall be horribly puzzled.''
I will tell you every thing i can,'' replied Martha, good-
humoured.  But I don't think I understand much about it
myself,'
 What sort of a little boy is it that you papa has been so kind
to: Every body is talking about it, and Lady Clarissa says there is
something quite sublime in what he is going to do for him. But
suppose Sir Matthew must have remarked some qualities particularly
amiable and good in the child, or he would not distinguish him so
remarkably from all others of the same class.''
 You have heard the story of his saving Lady Clarissa Sharpton
from the cow that was going to toss her, have you not, MISs Bro-
theron 2
 Yes, my dear, I heard all that, you know, the morning was here;
-though, by the by, you were not in the room, I remember. But there
must be something more in it than that. Do tell me all you know,''
Indeed I don't know any thing more,'' said Martha.
 What sort of a child is in2
A very nice little fellow indeed, and I think if I had been papa l
should have done the same thing myself.''
 Really Then you do think this child is something out of the
common way, I suppose? Pray tell me, dear Martha, will you, if you
hear much about the people that work in the factories and the child-
drew in particular 2''
No, indeed, Bliss Brotherton, I know nothing in the world about
them: except that lI sometimes hear papa say that they are all very idle
and ungrateful,'' replied Martha.
o MICHAEL ARMSTRONG.
101
I have been told that they are a very wretched set of people.
But, perhaps, they cannot help it. Martha?'' returned Mary.
I do not know how that can be, Miss Brotherton; every body can
help being idle, and every body can help being ungrateful, I1 should
think.''
 But it seems that they all live together, and make one another
worse ; and, in that case, the children are very much to be pitied; for,
poor little things, they cannot help themselves. What makes you
think this little boy is a nice child? Have you ever talked to him
much 2'
Yes, a good deal;: but papa has been taking him shut to a great
many houses: and besides, he has been occupied very much in learn-
in his part, for Duo, who was teaching him, said that he could hardly
read at all. So I have been trying to help him, and he is very quick.
But I like him, too, because he appears so fond of his mother and bro-
ther. He cares for nothing that can be given him, unless he can take
some of it to them.''
`And does your papa let him do so?''
Oh1 yes, every day.''
 That is very kind. Then I suppose the little fellow is superlative
happy:'
1 don't know,'' replied Martha, with a slight shake of the head.
I is very strange if he he not,'' observed Miss Brotherton. eIt
he were kept from his mother I could easily understand that he might
be very miserable, notwithstanding the great good luck that has be-
fallen him; but if he is permitted to see her constantly, I can't imagine
what he can want more.''
I don't know,'' again replied MArtha.
The expected guests began now rapidly to assemble, and refresh-
ments were handed round previous to their being conducted to the rom
prepared for the evening's amusement. : Don't forsake me, dear
Martha'' whispered Miss Brotherton, ` I am not very intimate with
any of these ladies and gentlemen, and I shallnot enjoy the evening's
amusement, unless lI am seated next you,''
Martha felt a good deal surprised at the compliment, but readily
agreed to the proposal; and in a few minutes, Lady bOwling, who was
any thing rather than pleased by the whole affair, gave the assembled
party to understand that the time fixed for their entering the theatre
had arrived.
On tiptoe with curiosity, and eager beyond measure, to see what
Lady Clarissa Sharpton, Mr. Osmond Norval, and : all the Dow-
lings'' would look like on the stage, the numerous company almost
ran over one another in the vehement zeal with which they prepared to
obey her.
Of course no expense had been spared in fitting np the apartment
allotted to the purpose, in form and style as like as might be to a
theatre; and, thanks to the taste and ingenuity of the little French
governess, the thing had been not only expensively, but well done.
The space railed in for the orchestra very conveniently divided the

TIME LIFE AND ADVENTURES
high, and dressed, in all respects, precisely as he had been on the
memorable night of Lady Clarissa's vaccine adventure.
In dumb show the lady indicated the direction from whence the
dreaded monster would approach; and the most energetic and un-
sparing action of the limbs and person secured the audience, as well as
her deliverer, from any possible mistake on the subject. MIchael, too,
performed his part with great spirit, exaggerating, as he had been
commanded, by every possible means, the maneuvres necessary for
turning the front of a cow.
To this scene, to, the audience gave loud applause, and in the
midst of it entered Sir MAtthew, who was, of course, greeted by braves,
`Long drawn out,'' till the ladies and gentlemen having nearly
detained one another, ceased at last, and listened to the beautiful
explanation which followed.
First the company were made to comprehend that the danger was
over, for the well-taught Michael turned about, and manfully facing
the audience, pronounced distinctly
The best is gone'
Then Sir Matthew, after bowing respectfully to the lady, said,
PerMit me, made. to express my joy,
That you've been saved by this good little boy.''
It was, however, uttered in an accent of such temperate and measured
feeling, that not even LAdy Dowliug saw any thing very particular in
it. A precaution by the way, which had been suggested by the gen-
tlemen during the frequent rehearsals.
Lady Clarissa's acting then became animated indeed; for the poet,
following her instructions, had composed for her in smooth, yet
startling rhymes, about thirty lines of the most fervent thanksgiving,
in which, now laying one hand on the head of the ragged child, now
clasping both together in the eagerness of her address to Sir MAtthew,
and now gracefully extending both arms towards the audience, as if
to make them shares in her generous emotions, she produced an effect
more easily imagined than described.
The speech which followed from Sir Matthew was very noble, and
at once let the audience into all the secret purposes of his benevolent
heart. The by-play of Michael during this scene had been prepared
for by his benefactor with particular care, but somehow or other the
boy was not at in catching the knight's idea; for instead of the ten-
der hut joyous smile with which he had been instructed to look up
into the face of his magnificent patron, his countenance expressed
nothing but terror.
That little fellow does not look happy, Martha,'' whispered Miss
Drotherton.
Ol no: he looks very frightened,'' replied Martha, `` but that is
very natural, is is not, considering the novelty of his situation 7''
I don't know,'' said the heiress.

The piece went on to exhibit the beautiful manner in which this
adoption of a ragged factory-boy into the bosom of the Dowling family
had been hailed by all'of them as an especial grace from heaven, on
account of the opportunity it afforded for relieving the overflowing
generosity of their hearts. Sir MAtthew, while looking eunl e
his sixteen full-dressed offspring, who were now again skilfully
grouped upon the stage, was made to exclaim with clasped hands,
and an almost sobbing excess of emotion,
 The india and the orphan are more dear,
To their young hearts, than million pounds a year'
Every body was touched, and again the applause was deafening.
Then came a very striking scene indeed. Michael appeared
superbly dressed, and on each side of him was a middling-sized Miss
Dowling, holding lightly and gracefully such a little basket, from
under the covers of which seeped out grapes and peaches on the one
side, and something that had the semblance of a flask of wine on the
other.
Then spoke the fair-haired Louisa.
Dear little by, this basket's nll or on.
Ti to reward the courage you have shown.''
And then Miss Charlotte.
So is this to, my pretty little boy,
We hope 'will give your poor old rother may.''
And when Michael, having received a basket in each hand, appeared
preparing to depart, the two young ladies exclaimed together,
Tis pass ends it, who's so very kind,
IIow to do good, is all ue sets o fn?'
Upon this, Michael turned round again towards the audience, and
stood stock still. It was quite evident that he had some speech to
make which he had apparently forgotten, for it was impossible for any
child to look more completely distressed and at a loss.
At length it became pretty evident that, in lieu of all other per-
france, the poor boy was going to cry; and some ingenious per-
sons doubted whether it might not be in his part to do so; but this
idea was speedily removed by the very matter-of-fact pokes and
judges which the two young ladies bestowed upon him. In addition
to this it seemed as if the little fellow caught some stimulating sounds
from the coulisses, for he cast more than one further glance in that
direction, and at length, with what was evidently a great effort, he
stammered out,
 My mother'as deer, and so's my brother too,
But clearer still are your pap and yo.
IIis charity'a so great, his heart so good,
He gives he need clothes; the hungry fool;
And I for-one-will.-day-and night-in prayer,
Ask blessings-for-him-and-his-worth declare''

TEE LINE AD ADYTunRES
The two last lines were so completely choked by the tears, which
all his efforts could not suffice to restrain, that they were perfectly
unintelligible to the audience.
Is all that vehemence of weeping a part of Mr. Norval's com-
position?'' inquired Miss Brotherton in a whisper to Martha.
Upon my word I don't know: but I should think not,'' was the
reply.
 Martial'' said the heiress, very earnestly, `` that child is suffering
from an agony of terror.''
I should hope not,'' said Martha, in a voice that somewhat
faltered.
Do you know any thing about this boy ?'' pursued Miss Bro-
theron, continuing her whispering.  Do you know any thing about
the mother he talks of a''
e Nothing whatever, Miss Brotherton.''
 Do you feel quite satisfied, my dear, that this romantic adventure
has been, or will be, advantageous to him?''
I think,'' replied Martha, ``that one can hardly doubt his being
`better off here than in the poverty of his mother's dwelling. YOu saw,
Miss bBrotherton, what a rugged condition the clothes were in which
he had worn before,''
 Decent clothes are a comfort, my dear Martha, there can be no
doubt of it; but compared with the other circumstances which in-
fluence the happiness of life, they are of no great importance. Of
course I suppose that your father means to educate him. Do you
know whether he can read his bible yet2''
1 know that he could not,'' replied Martha, "`when he came
here.''
Poor little watch1 That is very terrible neglect somewhere.
What sort of person is the mother?''
 By Michael's account,'' replied Martha, smiling, ``she is a very
estimable person indeed; but it certainly seems that she has not taken
much pains with his education, poor little fellow :'
 what a sad thing it is,'' continued Miss Brotherton, `` that we all
of us know so little of the poor people employed in the factories1 I
believe they are said to he exceedingly well pui, but still I don't
think it is quite right for the rich people in a neighbourhood to take
a notice whatever of the poor. I know it is not so in other places;
for I have heard my schoolfellows continually talk of their fathers'
tenants and work-people, and of their schools, and their clothing
societies, and all sorts of things, and Share been trying to do a little
good just at home with the families of some of the work-people about
the place. But I have just now got my head strangely full of these
factory folks. I wish you could give me some information about
them, Martha.''
Indeed, my dear Miss Brotherton, I know as littleas condo. I am
told that they are very good-for-nothing, that they receive enormous
sums annually in wages, and yet that they are never contented, but
for ever complaining, just because they had work to do for what they

from the subject to which she appeared sa earnestly to have devoted
them. For she said in the low, slow, even tone, which denotes con-
generated feeling-
If this be so, Miss MArtha Dowling, of thousands of human beings
in a Christian country are stigmatized as wicked, because their destiny
has placed them in a peculiar employment, that employment ought to
be swept for ever and for ever from the plan, though the wealth that
flowed from it outweighed the treasures of MExico,''
Martha Dowling started, but said not a word in reply; there was
something in the manner of her neighbour which awed her. True,
genuine, deep feeling, is always sublime, be it manifested by such
yong girl as Mary Drotherton, or such an old king as Lear. But,
though Martha was silent, her companion suffered not the conversation
to drop; and presently resumed in a one of less exaltation,-` Do
you think, my dear, that 1 could get hold of your little Michael some
day, so that might have a little conversation with him?''
Yes, certainly, Miss Brotherton,'' replied Martha, 'I think papae
would be quite pleased, for he seems to like nothing better than seeing
every'body take notice of him.''
 Do you think your father loves the little boy, Martha''
`I am sure he is very kind to him,'' replied the conscious daughter a
little piqued.   For it can be nothing but kindness that makes him
take the child into the house, and feed him and clothe him for nothing.''
' And, of course, Martha, he will get some instruction here?''
Oh1 he has begun to read the bible already,'' replied the kind-
hearted girl, eagerly. Have undertaken that business myself. The
poor little fellow seemed to suffer so, when he was learning his part
I never saw a child appear so heartily ashamed of any thing.''
 One almost wonders at that too: brought up, as he must have
been, in the very lap of ignorance. I should have thought, after all I
have heard, that he would have been ashamed of nothing. However,
I should like to talk to him. At what hour do you give him his reading
lesson, Maria2'
 wHEn I can catch him,'' replied the young lady, laughing. You
have no idea, Miss Brotherton, how much the little gentleman is en-
aged. Papa has taken him about with him in the carriage, almost
every where, and such quantities of people have been to see him I''
And does he seem greatly delighted with it all'
No, I don' think he does. He seems to me to care for nothing
in the world but his mother, and a little crippled brother that he
talks of.'
ee That does not look as if he were thoroughly confirmed in wicked-
ness as yet,'' observed the heiress.
eNo, indeed1 It is his affectionate temper that has made the take
to him; for I do believe he is very idle, and hates his work, just as
papa says they all do,'' answered Martha.

for MIchael's sick mother to eat: and the child always carries it him-
self, when papa does not send him elsewhere,''
And at what hour does he generally go?''
`' Always after luncheon.''
 Don't you think the play must be almost come to an end, Martha?''
said Miss Brotherton. after looking again on the stage for a few mi-
notes, and yawning rather more conspicuously than politeness could
warrant.
1 should think it must,'' replied Martha, catching, and returning
the yawn.
There was, however, a good deal to be done. There was a figure
dance to be performed, and a trip to be played on the pianoforte, harp,
and violoncello, by the two eldest Miss Dowlings, and their music-
master,
This last was a very long business: and the heiress, who, instead of
having been instructed to endure annoyances patiently, had been
rather taught never to endure them at all, got up in the middle of it,
and telling MArtha that her head acted too much to permit her re-
gaining any longer, made her way out of the room, which she effected
the more easily from having taken her station near a side door, which
led from the theatre (in ordinary phase, the school-room) into the
private apartments of Mademoiselle Beaulieu.
Martha Dowling, of course, followed her, and expressed much con-
cern for her malady, offering all the specifics usually suggested by
one lady to another, under such circumstances.  No, thank you,''
was the reply she received to all, `` I only want to get away.''
 But it will not be very easy to do so, this way,'' replied Martha,
 unless you will condensed to go through the passage that leads from
the offices.''
Never fear, dear Martha,'' returned the self-willed young lady, t1
will condensed to go through any passage that will lead to fresh air,
for indeed that place was to hot t''
The room they first entered on passing through the door, was one
dedicated to the reception of globes, slates, guitars, dumb bells, dic-
binaries, embroidering-frames, and sundry other miscellanies con-
netted with an enlarged system of education. Beyond this was the
bedchamber of Mademoiselle, which again led to an apartment
opening upon that part of the school-room now occupied as the stage.
This room, which was denominated Mademoiselle Beaulieu's parlour,
was now converted into a general green-rom and dressing-room, for
into this, all exits from the stage were made.
While still in the bedroom, Miss Brotherton, and her more than
half-frightened companion, heard voices speaking in no very pleasant
accents from this theatrical retreat, and the angry tones of Sir MAtthew
Dowling himself were soon unmistakably audible.
LEt us go back, pray let us go back!'' said the greatly distressed
Martha, in a whisper.
:I am too in, my dear, to bear that room again,' whispered Miss
Brotherton, `' Let me sit down here for a few minutes, and I shall

word : MorninG'' and then placing her hands before her eyes re-
gained lost in no very pleasing every. But hardly had her medi-
nations lasted a moment, ere they were chased by hearing the sound
of some one falling near her, and looking round, she perceived poor
Martha stretched insensible upon the floor.
Inexpressibly shocked at remembering, which she did by no slow
action of the mind, the suffering to which her own unscrupulous curi-
osity had exposed the unfortunate girl, she ran to her with eager haste,
and with much repentant tenderness raised her head and did all her
small experience suggested towards restoring her. The comfortable
sensibility did not last long: and Martha, who with restored ani-
nation immediately recovered her recollection, and in whose com-
position no affectation of any kind had part, raised herself without
assistance from the ground, and silently placed herself upon a sofa.
 Dear excellent MarshalL'' exclaimed MIss Brotherton, with much
true feeling, `` fear not that I should ever repeat what I have so acci-
mentally heard; and let not your good and dutiful nature super thus,
because I have heard it. WE have all our faults, Martha, and it is
the duty of each to pray for the conversion of their own hearts first,
and then for the repentance of others. And what prayers, dear girl,
so likely to be heard, as those of a good and dutiful child? Let us
slip back to our places, Martha. This clapping of hands announces,
as I take it, the conclusion of the piece,''
Martha, though wounded to the very soul, uttered no word of de-
predation or complaint: but there was an unsophisticated simplicity of
character about her which made her decline, by a courtesy that had a
little of the stiffness of ceremony in it, the offered arm of Mary,
and stepping forward she opened the door by which they had left the
theatre, till the heiress had passed through it, and resumed her
place.

MIn BnorEnro certainly did not return home that night with
any doubts on her mind respecting the nature of Sir Matthew Dow-
ling's benevolence; but the fever of spirits which had seized her was
greatly increased by the information she had gained.
There was a vast deal of energy and strength of purpose in the
mind of Mary Brotherton, but hitherto all this had lain latent and

inert. The sentiment which in ninety-nine cases out of a hundred is
the first to awaken the female heart to strong emotion seemed to be
totally powerless to her. She had never yet felt the slightest approach
to the passion of love; nor was it very likely she should, for one
among her many peculiarities of character was the persuasion that
every man who paid her attention was in pursuit of her fortune, an
idea, which to such a temper as hers was calculated to act as a
sevenfold shield against all amateur attacks upon her heart.
Most truly therefore, up to this time, had she continued
In mailer meditation, fancy free''
But this could be said no longer; neither fancy nor any other faculty
could be termed free in one whose thoughts fixed themselves by night
and day upon one single subject, while feeling that to it she was ready
to sacrifice every thing case in life.
On re-entering her house on the memorable night of the Dowling
Lodge theatrical, Miss Brotherton retired to her apartment without
even the intention of sleeping. She said her head upn her pillow
deliberately determined not to close her eyes in sleep till she had
made up her mind as to the best way of resuming the pale trembling
child, whose voice and form haunted her, from the horrible bondage
of Sir Matthew Dowling's charity.
The question was not altogether an easy one. She could hardly
doubt that very strong indignation would follow any open effort on
her part to interfere with a child publicly held up as the favoured
object of Sir Matthew's loudly-vaunted benevolence, and moreover,
privately marked out by his vindictive nature as a victim to his
hatred.
WHether as a rival in his munificence, or a champion against his
hate, it was pretty certain that her interference would render her
obnoxious to her pompous neighbour's displeasure, and this she had
no inclination to encounter if she could help it. For though at this
moment she felt within her a strength and firmness of purpose not
easily shaken, the poor girl knew that she stood alone in the world,
with no friend to support her more powerful than nurse Teletext, and
nothing but her two hundred thousand pounds' worth of this world's
trumpery to enable her to have her way, and her will, in many matters
that she feared might turn out rather difficult to manage.
So she determined to avoid quarrelling with Sir Matthew Dowling
long as she could, and though the image of Michael struggling with
his years, and the plaiutive sound of his voice as he pleaded for leave
to labour again, absolutely haunted her memory, she determined upon
being cautious, wise, and very deliberative in any measures she might
eventually take to ensure his release.
Under the influence of these prudential resolutions, Miss Bro-
theron for the present abandoned her purpose of seeking a convcr-
nation with the child himself, and determined to find her way to the
cottage of his mother instead. Yet seen this she felt must bc done
with caution. HEr carriage and her liveries were about as splendid

articles useful to man, without rendering those employed upon it unfit
to associate with the rest of their fellow-creatures This seems to
me so gross an absurdity that I cannot give faith to it, and therefore
I suspect that the depravity and wickedness you and Miss MArtha
Dowling talk about, must arise from these people having too much
money at their command. This, perhaps, may lead to temperance
and extravagance. Don't you think this may be the case, Mrs.
Temlett 2'
Good gracious, no, Miss Mary1 Why they are all the very
poorest starving wretches upon earth,''
 But they may be poor because they are extravagant, nurse. They
must get a most monstrous quantity of money, for though none of the
gentlemen ever talk much of their factories, I have repeatedly heard
allusion made to the enormous sums paid every week to the work-
people. And it is quite clear that all the families must get a great
deal, because all the little children work, which can hardly be the case
elsewhere. Now, I cannot help thinking, nurse, that a great deal of
good might be done by teaching them a little economy, and inducing
them to lay by their superfluous money in a savings-bank. That is one
great reason why I want to get acquainted with the people themselves.
Now, for instance, that poor sick widow Armstrong-the mother of
the little boy that Sir Matthew Dowling has taken; 1 am quite sure
that she can have no wickedness to hurt me-and I am determined,
use, to go and call upon her.''
 Well, my dear, that can't do no great harm, certainly: and, if
you like it, I can go in the carriage with you.''
:mOst certainly I should like you to go with me, but not in the
carriage, Mrs. Teletext. I don't want to have all the people in her
neighbourhood staring at me, or at her either; and that they would be
sure to do if we went in the carriage. I mean to walk, nurse.''
 Do you know where the woman lives, my dear?''
: No; I must leave you to find that out,''
What is her name, Miss Mary ?''
"? Armstrong. She is a widow, and lives somewhere in Ashleigh.
Let us walk into the garden, and while 1 am looking after my seed-
lings, you can inquire of one of the under-gardeners, or the boy.
And if you manage the matter well, the next prime blossom that i get
from my experiment-bed, shall be called the Teletext geranium.''
While this conversation was going on at Milford Park, the residence
of Mss Brotherton, Dr. Crockley arrived to enjoy a site-d-tate break-
fast with Sir Matthew in ` the study'' at Dowling Lodge. This room,
though not so splendid as some of its neighbours under the same roof,
could, nevertheless, he made very snug and comfortable upon coca-
sion, and an excellent breakfast was spread before them; while the
two gentlemen sat in judgment upon little Michael's constancy, and
consulted on the best method of bringing him into better order.
 Confound the impi'' exclaimed 5ir Matthew, as he selected his
2
110
THE LIFE AND ADVENTURES
favourite dainties, `` is it not provoking, Crockley, that I should have
taken such an aversion to him? Upon my soul, I never hated any
thing so much in my life. In the first place it is disgusting to see
him dressed up, walking about the house like a tame monkey, when I
know that his long fingers might be piercing thousands of threads for
two shillings a week;: and it is neither more nor less than loathsome
to see him eat, at luncheon, sometimes when we have had him in be-
fore company, exactly the very same things that my children at
themselves; and then upon the back of it all, to know that the un-
grateful little viper hates the very sight of me. I don't believe,
Crockley, that any good can come of all this, equal to what it makes
me suffer in the doing. It is perfectly unnatural to see him close
within an inch of my own legs. I'd rather have a tame toad crawling
about by half. I must give it up, Crockley-I must, upon my son.''
You are the master, Sir Matthews. I can't stop you, if do it you
will: but I can tell you this, I have been calling at fifty different
houses, at the very least,' sincethis jobbegan, and I pledge you mastered
honour that in every one of them the only thing talked of was your
benevolence and generosity. Such an example?' tried one; ` So
heavenly-minted1' said another; ` It is enough to bring a blessing
on the whole country,' whined a third; and, ` It is to be hoped that
such goodness will be rewarded in this world and the next,' observed
a fourth. Think, Sir Matthew, how all this will tell against the
grumblings about Miss Nance Stephens and her sudden demise.''
 That's true-devilish true, Brockley-and yet it's no cure for my
being sick at the stomach every time I see him,''
'I don't know about that; I should think it was, or, at any rate,
if you'll only bear it a little longer I should not be at all surprised if
you were to be relieved by some other great capitalist setting up in the
same way, and as your name has been sung out, that would do just
as well. Upon my soul, i'm in earnest; I should not the least
wonder it, before the end of three months, every one of your first-rates
were to have a tame factory-child in their houses, to act like the
hedgehogs we get to eat black-beetles for us. And they'd do their
work well too, Sir MAtthew: all the nasty, creeping, multiplying
plagues, in the shape of civil tales against the factory system, would
e swallowed up by the clearing-off effects of these nice little hedge-
hog gently.''
`` You are as keen as your own lancet, Brockley; and I never turn
a deaf ear to any thing you say. But it's monstrous hard though, that
I can't walk about my own house without running the risk of seeing
this odious little grub. BY the way, Crockley, why could not my lady
take a factory-girl in by way of charity? Some of the little benches
are sightly enough before they have worked down their flesh too far;
and, though I can't say I am particularly tender over the lanky idiot
looking patterns that we mostly get at the mill, I'albert what you please
that I should never have the sight of a girl, as I do the sight of this
`.,, 1ely no, Sir Matthes,'' replied the door, laughing im-

moderately.  But what would my lady say? And what would all
the other ladies say? No, no, leave that alone, and make up your
mind to let the boy has the run of the house for a month or two;
after which you may send him to the devil if you will; for the good
will be done, and the boy himself forgotten.''
t That's all vastly easy for you to lay down, chapter and verse,
wise man that you are,'' replied the knight. ` But if I tell all, I can
let you into a secret, Crockley, that would make you change your
min. perhaps. The long and the short of it is, that I can't keep my
and off him, and if the young black-hearted scamp-I know he is
black-hearted, I'm quite sure of it on account of a look he has got
with his eyes, that makes one always feel so uncomfortable-if he
were to take it into his ile ungrateful head to go about the country
telling every thing that I may have happened to say and do to him,
When his nasty ways have pushed me further than i could bear, I don't
think the history of the charity job would do much good, doctor.''
Doctor Crockley gae a long low whistle; and then, after
minute's meditation, sail, : The's a bore.''
I know it is,'' sharply responded his patron, `` a devilish bore.
But you don't suppose that I am to stand bursting with rage, and not
take the liberty of speaking my mind to a factory grub, do you?'
` Heaven forbid . A whole factory full of benches may all drop down
dead, I hope, before it comes to that,'' replied his friend.  But
what you have stated is worth attention, Sir Matthew. I don't like
the notion of that child's having tales to tell. It spoils all,''
1 know it,'' returned the vexed knight.  MArtha told me just
now, not ten minutes before you came, that Miss Irotherton said she
should like very much to talk to the boy: she is as sharp as a needle,
you know, and Ill answer for it would find out all he has got to tell,
and a devilish deal more, perhaps, in no time. Pretty work that
would make would it not Augustus sure of her, he tells me; and
just fancy such a match as that spoiled by the forked tongue of tia
little viper1 The very notion makes one mad.''
`` A cure must be found for that mischief, let it cost what it may,''
replied Brockley; `` and for the future it might be better, perhaps, for
your charity, Sir Matthew, to show itself some other way. You are
too honest-hearted, that's the fact. A fine bold intellect, like yours,
can't descend to the paltry patience belonging to inferior minds. Is
there no getting rid of the boy? No possibility of sending him 'aren-
tice some where or other ?''
'Prentice?'' said Sir Matthew, looking with a very singular ex-
pression into the face of his friend.  Prentice?'' he repeated,
and stretching out his hand, he seized upon that of Doctor
Crockley, which he shook with extraordinary armour. ` Send him
as a prentice: Upon my soul, Crockley, if you had laid down

grow rich, and hold his tongue2 But no, he got it by some poisonous
humanity notion or other, and a devilish shake he gave to the system
just at first, by his absurd bill for the protection of infant paupers; bu:
such men as Sharpton are not to be knocked down like nineties,
either by law-makers, or law; and to say the truth, old Sir Robert
Peel's bill was to all intents and purposes a dead letter within
two years after it was passed. BLess your soul, it was the easiest
thing in the world to keep the creatures so ignorant about the bill,
after the first talk was over, that they might have been madero believe
any thing and to submit to any thing. In fact the question for them
always lies in an egg-shell, They must either do what the masters
would have them, on srany. That fact is worth all the bills that
ever were passed: and another thing is, that as long as there's
nothing to prevent our own friends and relations from being among
the magistrates, even if complaints are made, we can manage them.''
Now true it is, Sir Matthew, that there is no inequality of acci-
dental condition than can equal the inequality produced by a decided
superiority in the intellectual powers,'' said Dr. Crockley. ` At this
moment I give you my sacred honour that I look upon you, and your
friend Mr, Elwood Sharpton also, as standing in a much more com-
landing position than any duke in the country. Whats a long
descent compared to a long head, Sir Matthew? Ill tell you what
the difference is. A Long descent pretty generally helps a man to
empty his purse, whereas a long head will nearer fail to help him all
it. It is as clear to me, as that the sun's in heaven, Sir Matthew,
that the game is in your own hands. I know-for I have made some
curious experiments that way-I know what a dog may be taught to
do by hunger, and you may rely upon it that it is just as powerful in
a man. Egan, Bir Matthew, it is a very fine subject for scientific
experiments. It is difficult to say how far it might go. If a dog, for
example, may be taught tricks by unger, that approach in ingenuity
to the powers of man, who may not man, skilfully acted upon by the
same principle, be brought to rival the docility of a dog l''
I see nothing in nature to stop it, doctor,'' replied Sir Matthew,
with an air of great animation.   But remember, my dear Crockley,
this is not a point to be touched upon in the book we were talking of.
The public, you know, can have nothing on earth to do with the
private regulation of our affairs. People have just as much right to
inquire at what o'clock my lord uke expects his valet to get up, and
moreover what the valet eats for breakfast when he is up, as thcyhave
to know what hours our hired labourers keep, and what they feed
upon. It is a gross inquisitorial interference, Brockley, and ought
not to be thought of in a fee country.'
 That's a first-rate idea though, Sir Matthew,'' said the doctor,
taking out his packet-book and pencil. 1 must book that. It is
turning the parliament into an office of the inquisition. The centers
may call it a holy office, if they will, but the British people will need
bear the notion of a PIsToN. That's a capital idea, I promise

Crockley rose too; but, though he took up his hat and his riding-
whip from the chair on which he had placed them, he lingered as if
he had still something to say before he took his leave.
Sir Matthew, however, seemed to take no notice of the hint, but
steering polish hand said decisively, `Good morning, debtor, good
morning. Let us see you again soon,''
D. CGrockley upon this stretched out his hand too, but instead of
clutching that of the knight, he seized upon his button. `'One word,
Sir Matthew, one word. You are too much of a man of business to
think me troublesome. Respecting that little appointment that you
are talking about the other day; I should like to have it settled.
Because, to say the truth, I shall consider myself as wearing your
livery;: or, to speak more fitly, to be fighting positively under you
colours, when this is done; and of course you know we ought to
understand one another completely,''
No doubt of it, Crockley. I said nothing that I do not mean to
stand to. Yon shall have two hundred a year, paid quarterly, for
attending to the health and wellbeing, and all that, you know, of the
factory children. But as I don't want you to give them two hundred
pounds' worth of physik, remember I shall expect that you will make
up the deficiency in-in just saying round about the neighbourhood
how remarkably well every thing goes on at Rockford Factory. OIl
pledge you my word that every thing does go on capital well there,
Crockley, so you will have nothing on your conscience on that
score''
'1 am not afraid of that, Sir Matthew; I know I may trust you.
BUt I should like a bit of a memorandum about my own business, if
you please.''
Quite right, quite right, sir. I am too much a man of business
to object to that. Draw up the engagement, such as you wish it to
be, and I dare say I shall make no objection to signing it.''
After this a coral hand-shaking was exchange and the friends
parted.

A FOOTNOTE SPECTRE-AN AVERAGE-MISS BROTHIEnRTON
GOes WEI VERY DAY.
Ms. AnGELEs inquiries proved successful. Jim Sykes, the
weeding-boy. knew perfectly well where widow Armstrong lived: and
after he had repeated his instructions three times, mAry Brotherton
and her resisting chaperon set off on their expedition. On one
124
THE LIFE AND ADVENTURES
point only did the self-willed heiress yield to the judgment of her com-
anion. MAry, who knew, that though she seldom went beyond the
shelter of her own park-paying, she often walked without fatigue
within it for two or three hours together, wished poset off for Huxley-
lane on foot; but Mrs. Teletext talked so much of the fatigue, that
the good-natured girl consented to let the carriage convey them to the
point at which the lane diverged from the high-road. This yielding,
however, was wholly from consideration for her companion. For
herself she believed the precaution quite needless; and she was right.
However much her temper might have been endangered by the series
of spoiling processes she had undergone, her health had been taken
good care of, and few girls of her age in any rank, had greater power
and will for exertion than herself.
Nevertheless, before she had driven half a mile, she heartily rejoiced
at having sacrificed her own inclination to that of her good nurse; for
the road to Ashleigh was the favourite ride of the officers quartered in
the neighbourhood, and had she been seen on foot, it is probable
that before reaching Huxley-lane she would have been surrounded by
a body-guard of military. So greatly did this danger appeal her
spirits, that the first moment she found herself free from a white-
gloved hand either at one window or the other, she stopped the car-
ridge, and ordered the coaching to go far enough down the line
to permit her to get out unobserved by any persons passing by the
road.
But poor Mary was this day doomed to disappointment; and the
indignant, and almost passionate beating of her heart under it, made
her more conscious, perhaps, than she had ever been before, bow deeply
the business upon which she was engaged had entered into her soul.
Soon after Sir Matthew Dowling had dismissed his breakfast com-
anion, he strolled out towards his splendid states, and perceiving
his son loitering among the grooms, and himself equipped for the
saddle, he inquiredl whether he was going to ride, : Only to Ashleigh,
governor,'' was the reply.  Then wait five minutes, Augustus, and
I will ride with you.''
Whether the youth approved the proposal or not, he was fair to
submit to it, and the evil star of Mary bBrotherton contrived to bring
them to the top of Huxley-lane at the moment her carriage was about
to turn into it.
 Stop'' cried the young lady, accompanying the word with a very
energetic pull at the check-string.  Go on to Ashleigh,'' was the
order that followed.
 WAs ever any thing so provoking, nurse? Do you see who those
hateful men are 2''
 WHy 'is Sir Matthew, my dear,'' replied the gentle old woman.
e The wretchl'' muttered Mary between her teeth at the very
moment the Sir MAtthew on one side, and his languishing son on the
other, besieged her carriage.
Not for my right hand would l have him guess where I am going,''
to ISRAEL NiTROGEN.
15
thought she, as with a face suflusel with the deepest carmine that
agitation could produce, she forced her lips into an meaning smile
in return to their salutation.
The father and son came to exactly the same conclusion, and at the
same moment. There was but one cause that it was possible to assign
for her evident emotion. She was deeply in love with Augustus,-more
deeply than even the young man himself hal imagined. The thing
was plain, no doubt remained, no not a shadow of it on the mind of
either father or son, but it was the elder gentleman only who at once
determined to push so fine a game to its close, with as little delay as
possible.
Feeling quite sure that there was no liberty he could take at this
moment which would not he welcome, he made a sign to the coach-
man to stop, and deliberately lismounting he threw his reins to his
groom, toll Miss Brotherton's footman to open the carriage-door, and
stepped in with the assumed air of a partially loved friend, who knows
that no leave ncel be asked.
MAry shrunk back into her corner with considerably more disgust
than if a reptile had possessed itself of the seat opposite.
 This is not quite as it should be, is it?'' aid Sir Matthew, with
alter.  Perhaps some other may have a better right here than I ?
And a very expressive smile accompanied the words.
 Sir2'' said Miss Brotherton.
Come, come, my dear child, you must not look vexed at any of
my little jokes. You know how we all dote upon you1 Dear creatures
How beautiful that sweet blush makes you look He, he: there goes
poor Augustus looking very much as if he could wring hs papa's neck
off. But his turn, we will hope, may come by and by. And now,
my dear, I'll tell you what I am come here for. We all want you,
and your good MIrs. Teletext too, if she likes it, to come over to us
quite en fumille to-morrow. I don't know what love-powder you have
been scattering amongst us, but there is not a single individual of the
family who does not positively dote upon you. Tell me, my pretty
MAry, do you feel a little kindness for some of us in return ?''
An attempt to take her hand accompanied this speech; and Mrs.
Teletext, wbo estimated pretty nearly her young lady's affection for
Sir Matthew and his race, actually trembled for the consequences.
But, to her great surprise, MAry answered, after the cause of a mi-
note, `Oh, dear Sir Matthew you are only laughing at me:'' in a
voice so exceedingly childish and silly, that it might, under similar
circumstances, have made the fortune of a comic actress; and though
she did not permit him to touch the hand he attempted to take, she
placed it, together with its fellow, so playfully behind her, that Sir
Mathew could only laugh and call ler, '`dear pretty creatures''
Meanwhile the carriage proceeded to penetrate through the dirty
dismal streets, which, in that direction, formed the suburb of sh-
leigh.
1 must get out here,'' said Miss Brotherton, suddenly pulling the
check-string.

who could tell if fraud and drunkenness might not enter the moment
after, to complete the group 
But there was little of selfishness and much of courage in the heart
of Mary Drotherton, so she presently forgot very notion of personal
danger, and was thus enabled to see things as they really were.
On one side of the small bare chamber, and in some degree shel-
tered by the door which opened against it, stool a rickety machine
once intended for a bedstead. Two of the legs had given place to
brickbats, and instead of a bed the unsteady frame now supported
only a thin layer of very dirty straw, with the body of a dying female
stretched upon it. The only other article of furniture in the room was
an old deal box without a cover, but having a couple of planks, each
about three feet long, laid across it; serving either for table or chairs
as occasion might require. The walls, the floor, the ceiling, and the
remnant of a window, were all alike begrimed with smoke and
din.
It took not long to make this inventory, and having completed it,
the yung lady, still holding in each hand a staring child, turned
towards the inhabitant of this miserable den, and said,
 Are you ill, my good woman 2''
The being she addressed raised her heavy eyes, and in a voice so
low as to be scarcely intelligible, answered  Yes,''
'Have you no assistance, nobody to nurse you ?''
 Nobody but these,'' pointing to the children.
Has any doctor seen her ?'' demanded Mary of the eldest child.
 No ma'am,'' replied the little girl.
And how long has she been il?'
e ver since she com'd from the mill,''
And how long is that?''
A twelvemonth,'' said the little one.
I don't know,'' said the elder.
bUt, my poor children, you are not the only people that live with
her, I suppose? Have you got any father ?''
 Yes.''
e Where is he 2
At the mill''
Have you got any body else belonging to you?'' said Miss Bro-
theron, shuddering.
There's Sophy, and Dick, and Grace,'' replied the eldest child.
 WHere are they all'' again inquired Miss Brotherton.
:At the mill,'' was again the answer.
Are Sophy and Grace grown up?''
Sophy is,'' answered the child, `` and Grace, almost.''
 Then why do they not stay at home, one of them at least, to take
care of this poor woman ?''
'Cause they mustn't. I 'tends mother.''
You are not big enough take care of her, my poor child. Why
don't you go to the factory, and let one of the bigger ones stay at
home72''
128
TO LIE AND ADVENTURES
e They won't have me now, 'cause of this.'-And as she spoke, the
child held up a little shrivelled right-hand, three fingers of which
had a joint deficient. :I can't piece now, and so they won't let me
come.''
 And Sophy won't let me go, 'cause of this,'' said the little one,
slipping her arm out of a letdown (which was the only garment she
had), and displaying the limb swollen and discoloured, from some
violent contusion.
:My poor little creature how did you do this7' said Mary,
tenderly, taking the little hand in her, and examining the frightful
bruise.
 Twas the billy-roller,'' said the little girl, in an accent that
seemed to insinuate that the young lady was more than commonly dull
of apprehension.
 But how did it happen, my child? Did some part of the ma-
chinery go over you?'
No1-That was me,'' cried the elder, with a loud voice, and
again holding up her demolished fingers. ee Twas the stretcher's
billy-roller as smashed Becky.''
 Tas, cause I was sleepy,'' said the little one, beginning to try,
for she construed Mary's puzzled look into an expression of his-
pleasure.
 They beats 'em dreadful ma'am,'' said the sick woman, evidently
exerting herself beyond her strength. : She's a good little girl for
work; but they will fall asleep, all of 'em at times, when they be
kept so dreadful long''
But these bruises could not be the effect of heating,'' said Mary,
again examining the arm,  i is quite impossible.'
 WHy, ma'am, the billy-roller as they beats 'em with, is a stick big
enough to kill with; and many and many is the baby that has been
crippled by it.''
There was something so hollow, so sunken in the woman's voice,
that Miss Brotherton felt terrified. The fact that a child of the size
of the baby before her should have been beaten with such a weapon,
and with such violence, seemed wholly incredible. Again she thought
of Sir Matthew Dowling's warning, and wished that she were not
alone.
 I am afraid that you are very ill,'' said she, `` and I know not how
I can help you. Money I can give, but there is nobody here to make
use of it for you.''
 Money:'' murmured the sinking woman from her layer of straw.
Money, ye sen give money? Ohl give it, give it. Give it to her-
give it to the child; she knows what it is, she knows I am dying for the
want of it. It is too late for me but give it, give it, and may God-''
 HEre the miserable creature's strength wholly failed; her eyes
closed, and to all appearance, she was already a corpse.
Oh this is very dreadful'' cried poor Mary, wringing her hands,
`nurse will know better than me,'' and so saying, she turned eagerly
towards the door.

'She be gone, mother, and haven't given nothing,'' said the eldest
girl, in a voice so mournful expressive of disappointment, that, spite
of her alarm, Mary stopped to take half-a-crown from her purse, which
she put into the child's hand.
She looked at the coin, and in a half-whisper ejaculated, : O '
Then creeping to the bed, she put it into the palm of her mother's
hand, pressing the fingers down upon it, and in an accent of inter-
rotation uttered the word ` Bread ?''
This Mary heard,but not the answer to it, for she had quieted the
scene before it was uttered. On opening the door of the house, she
started at seeing Sir Matthew Dowling still within a dozen yards of it;
he was standing beside the carriage, with one arm extended to keep
the door of it open, and the other resting against the vehicle on the
opposite side of the opening, while his head thrust forward within an
inch of good Mrs, Teletext's nose effectually prevented her following
her young lady, however much she might have wished to do so. lle
had, indeed, upon Miss Drotherton's disappearance repeated the good
woman almost by force, and then addressed her in such a strain as
was rapidly working her up to make an attempt to escape from the
other side of the carriage, when the reappearance of the young lady
released her from her thraldom,
Mrs, Tremlettt'' he said,'' are you aware of the awful respond-
siblings which will rest upon you if any thing unfortunate happens to
your amiable, but most headstrong young lady All the neigh-
boyhood know, Mars. Teletext, that she has, as it were, placed herself
for protection in your hands, refusing all other counsel, and shutting
her ears to all other advice, and it is thus that you perform your
duty:''
Good God, sir what do you mean?'' said the good woman, in
great agitation. ` Let me out if you please, sir. If my young lady is
in any danger, it is wicked to keep me sitting here. Let me out,
sir ''
1 wiLl let you out, Mrs. Temlett,'' replied the knight, still firmly
retaining the position which so effectually kept her in, ''1 will let you
out; but first, for her sake and your own, it is my duty to tell you in a
few words the sort, of place she has now thought proper to enter.
Don't struggle, Mrs. Teletext, but hear me. It is not possible they
can do her any personal injury as long as i am so near the door of the
house as at present. Be very sure that from some hole or corner of
the filthy premises, some spying eyes are at this moment watching us.
There is no danger of her being murdered now, but as sure as you sit
there, Mrs. Teletext, murdered she will be, if she goes without the
protection of a powerful arm within such des of sin and iniquity as
she has entered now. One short moment more, Mrs. Temlet-one
short moment, while I tell what the creatures are among whom she has
thrown herself. The house is notorious as one of the very worst in
Ashleigh. The man is an habitual drunkard, whom I, and my ex-
element servant Parsons, have endeavoured in every possible way to
reform-but in vain. The moment he has got his wages, he goes to

than here. I really cannot answer for it. It is in point of fact it-
possible to say whether there may not be something deleterious, some-
thing noxious, in short, to your very precious health in the atmosphere
of this room.'
I thank you, sir. Be sure I will take quite sufficient care of myself;
but it is not for me that your services are wanted-it is hero''
Bophy, the eldest girl seemed unconscious of what was going on,
for she remained perfectly motionless on the spot where she had first
knelt down; while the third sister, who had been sent on the poor
mother's last errand for bread, and who had crept back unobserved into
the room during the foregoing seen, oecupiodi the space on her right
hand, Mary Brotherton haring knelt on her left, so that there was
scarcely space for the approach of the smart apothecary.
 Move, my dear girls:'' said Mary, gently laying a hand on the
shoulder of each.
They both rose; while Mr, Thomas, carefully storing the anecdote
in aid of the gossiping part of his practice, looked and listened with
astonishment to what seemed to him the very unnatural conduct of the
rich young lady, and literally exclaimed, `` A clear case of religious
mania this, as I over saw1 She won't live long, probably. What a
match 1''
It required no very long examination of the poor patient, to discover
that her last moment was rapidly approaching
Upon my word, Miss Bratherton, I really wish I could persuade
you to come away,'' persisted the medical gentleman as he once more
turned towards her. The air is becoming more mephitic every instant.
e This woman is at the last extremity.''
 Nothing, then, can be done for her?'' said Mary,
 No, ma'am-nothing in the world. Not the whole college, if they
were present, could keep soul and body together for another hour, I
would venture to say,''
On this Miss Brotherton put a fee into his hand, and bent her head
in token that his business there was ended, and that he might depart.
But he did not immediately obey the hint, for pocketing the unwanted
golden prize, he seemed anxious to remain a little longer where such
blessings aboundedl, and refusing to the bed, again took hold of the
poor woman's hand, and then said in a voice of authority-'` Let me
have some water.''
It was Nary only who seemed to understand his words, and she
immediately obeyed them, placing in his hand the broken mug which
she had set aside upon the floor. The apothecary put the water to the
lips of the poor woman, and she again swallowed a little of it, after
which they saw her lips moe as if she was making an effort to speak
to them.
MIm. Teletext lent over her, and then, with a stronger effort he
articulated- Let mo see William'
e who is William ?'' said Mrs. Teletext raising herself, ` Is it one
of the children 2
 Ite father,'' said Bots.
136
THE LIE AND FEATURES
WHere is he to be found ?'' cruel Miss Brotherton, eagerly. ``Let
him be sought for instantly-where is he likely to he2'
..' At the gin-shop,'' replied the ungracions Grace.
If you know where he is, go for him,'' said MAry, impressively,
`and for God's sake let him not delay IN''
The girl she addressed stared at her as upon something utterly in-
comprehensible: bnt she obeyed, and, in so short a time'as to show
that the gin-shop was at no great distance, returned with a man of an
exterior as  filthy as the rest of his race, wretched crippled in the
legs, and a complexion that spoke both of ill health, and temperance.
. What-it is come to that, is it,already ?'' said the man looking
wistfully.at her from the bottom of the bed, but with a countenanee
whose lines seemed too fixed in the expression of hard indifference, to
permit its exhibiting much feeling-
She asked for you, father,'' said Sophy gently, then taking one of
her mother's hands in hers she murmured, `` Mother -Dear mother
-open your eyes upon us, father is here, and all of us,'' while large
tear-drops fell upon the livid face as she hung over it.
The dying eyes were once ore opened, and consciousness, and
recognition of them all, were visible as she suffered them to rest first
on one, and then on another. The boy only, from his position, she
could not see ; but even then, there seemed intelligence between them,
and she certainly knew he was lying ' beside her, for her head rested
against his, and she raised her left hand till her fingers touched his
cheek. The youngest child also when the mother's eyes opened, was
too much behind her, but she seemed aware of her vicinity, and pro-
bounced the words ``Little one1'' probably her usual appellation, ss
distinctly as to make the child start, and instantly climb upon the bed
to kiss her. The last movement was an effort to return this kiss; and
the next moment Mrs. Teletext removed the child's clinging lips from
a cASE.
A very awful interval of perfect stillness followed. Can I be of
any further service to you, Miss Brotherton ?'' from the lips of Mr.
Thomas, were the first words that broke it.
Poor Mary only shook her head, hut MIrs. Teletext replied, : No,
thank you sir, nothing more;'' and with repeated bows, and rather re-
reluctant step, he departed: turning, however, to give another glance at
the heiress, as he passed out, for he was not without hopes that she
might fall down in a fainting-fit. Nothing, however, of the kind hap-
pened, and he disappeared..
' You will go now, Mary dear:'' whispered MIns. Temlett,'andI
willL come here.to-morrow to inquire about them for you.''
Yes, I will go now,'' replied the young lady, .I cannot comfort
them.'' Then looking round upon the steadfast group, as if to dis-
cover,which of them appeared in the fittest state to be spoken to, the

She then led the way to her carriage, Mr. ITremlett followed, and
the next moment they were driving rapidly from the abode of the most
abject misery, to a residence which every quarter of the globe had con-
tribute to render luxurious.
it was evident that the heiress felt no inclination to converse;
indeed, for by far the greater portion of the way her face was con-
called by the handkerchief which she held to her eyes, and Mrs.
Teletext had too much real feeling to disturb her. After driving,
however, through the handsome lodge-gates, and sweeping up to the
noble entrance of her mansion, where already, at the sound of her
Approaching carriage, two or three servants were seen waiting like a
guard of honour to receive her, it seemed that her meditations had
not been wholly confined to the deathbed scene she had witnessed,
and that the sordid cabin, with its misery-stamped inhabitants, had
made a deep impression ; for the first, and for many hours the only
words she uttered after her return, spoken to the year of More, Teletext
as they walked arm in arm together through the hall, were these:
I too am living by the profit of the factory house. Is the division
just ?-Oh, God Is it holy 2''
The old woman felt that she trembled violently, but knew not what
words to utter that might compose her,
On arriving at the foot of the stairs, Mary withdrew her arm, and
mounting the more rapidly than her companion could follow, reached
her bedchamber alone, which she entered, closing and bolting the
door after her.

It will be easily believed that Sir MAtthew rode back to Dowling
Lodge not in the very sweetest hour in the world. : Bring u A
child in the way he should go,'' is an admirable proverb, and certain
it is that when that ` way'' is agreeable, he does very rarely `` depart
from the same.'' Thus it happens that the young gentlemen and ladies,
sons and daughters of the millocrats, who pile thousands pon thou-
sands, and acres upon acres, by the secret mysteries of their wonderful
compound of human and divine machinery, lo rarely or never take their
way into the dwellings that shelter and that hide the sufferings of their
operatives. Nothing is so distasteful to a truly elegant mill-owner as

 There's none but 'prentice taken in at the mill in the deep hollow,
Sir Matthew, if you mean that.''
Yes, sir, I do mean that,'' replied Sir Matthew with a very
ominous frown,  and there Master Michael Armstrong shall go, 'pre-
tice or no 'prentice, or I'll give him up my place, and take his.''
 That's all, then Sir Matthew,'' said the overlooked, preparing t
depart. I com'd to put you up to the boys ingratitude, and have
nothing further to say at present.''
 You need not trouble yourself any more about that, Mr. Parsons.
I will take care of him,'' replied the knight. Whereupon Mr. Parsons
made a bow, and departed.
Sir Matthew Dowling had already taken one tumbler of rock-and-
water. He now took a second, and then throwing himself back in his
arm-chair, indulged for several minutes in very deep meditation. At
the end of that time it seemed as if the good Rhine wine had done its'
office, for suddenly the knight's countenance became animated; the
heavy gloom which had rested upon it disappeared, and springing to
his feet he rang the bell with a part of lively jerk which showed he had
some project in and that he greatly relished.
It was the lively Peggy who answered the summons; but though she
entered almost out of breath from the eagerness with which she had
traversed the passage which led from the kitchen to the study, and
though she brought into immediate activity all the vagaries of which
she was capable, a smiling nod was all she got in return, so eager did
Sir Matthew appear to say, ` Go to Miss Martha, Peggy, as fast as you
can, and tell her to come here to me this very minute. Go, my dear,
and make haste, there's a good girl.''
Pery was disappointed and angry, for she had a great deal to tell
Sir Matthew about Michael Armstrong's ungratefulness, and all that
the servants thought and said about it; but the command she had
received was too peremptory to be trifled with, and though she very
nearly slammed the study door in shutting it, she failed not to deliver
her message, which was instantly obeyed with the most dutiful alacrity
by Martha.
Did you send Peggy for me, pass ?'' said she in entering.
eYes, Martha dear, I did. How are you a-day, my dear girl
I have not seen' you before this morning. Sit down, love, sit down;
I want to talk to you, Martha, I have got something upon my mind
that vexes me, and I am going to open my heart to you about it,''
 On, my dear, dear papa 1'' returned Martha, 'I should be so glad
if I could be of any use to you IF''
 You can, Martha-you can be of great use and comfort to me.,
In the first place you must be my father confessor, and let me confess
my faults to you, and I hope you will give me absolution if you can:
for really am very uncomfortable.''
e WHat can you mean, papa ?''
 hy, my dear, I mean thatIhave been foolish enough to put my-
self in a great pet, when I ought not to have done any such thing. It
is always wrong to let temper get the better of one; but in this case it

trees, the black tint of the loathsome factory seems to rest upon every
object near it. The walls are black, the fences are black, the win-
dow-panes (when there are any) are all veiled in black. No domestic
animal that pertinaciously exists within their tainted aurelius, but
wears the same dark hue; and perhaps there is no condition of
human life so significantly surrounded by types of its own wretched-
ness as this.
MArtha Dowling shuttered as she looked around her: and when
Michael returned to lead her in, she felt half afraid of crossing the
gloomy threshold.
But the widow Armstrong was, as usual, less dirty in her abject
misery than, perhaps, any other inhabitant of Huxley-lane, or its im-
mediate neighbourhood, and the mild countenance and gentle voice
with which she replied to the young lady's salutation removed all her
scruples, and she seated herself in the chair placed for her by Michael,
with the best disposition in the world to improve the acquaintance.
I hope you are getting better, MIrs. Armstrong?'' said Martha, in
that one of genuine female softness which it is so impossible to mis-
take, `` and that you don't miss little Michael as much as you did at
first.'
 You are very kind, ma'am, to take the trouble of coming to such
a place as this,'' replied the poor woman, in a voice that indicated
something like surprise. Upon which Michael, who had stationed
himself near enough to enable him to slip his little hand into hens,
said, with a tolerably expressive emphasis--` This is Miss Martha,
mother,''
I wish, ma'am, I had strength and power to thank you asI ought,
for all your condescending kindness to my poor boy?'' said the widow,
earnestly.I never see him, that he has not some fresh story to tell
me of your goodness to him. He can read a chapter in the Bible now
as well as any boy of his age need to do. And oh. Miss-This is
all owing to you-for never could he have given his time to it in the
factory.''
 There is more praise due to him than to me, Mrs. Armstrong, l
assure you. He is a very good boy at learning, and minds every
word that is said to him. I suppose he has shown you his copy-book
too, hasn't he,? I never saw a child that had so good a notion of
writing.''
: He was always a quick loy, Miss-but never can he be thankful
enough to you for teaching him how to put his quickness to profit. It
ill e the making of him.''
I am very glad to hear you speak so earnestly about his learning,
because that makes me think that you will be pleased at hearing the
business I am come upon. ly papae, who is very''-here poor Martha
stopped short. She was going to add-` kind to little Michael,'
bnt her honest heart would not let her pronounce the words: so she
changed the phrase, and went on with ` very desirous of being really
useful to Michael, has commissioned me, Mrs. Armstrong, to ask you
if you do not think it would be more profitable and advantageous to

THE LIFE AND ADVENTURES
if it is not a good plan. I mean to be the very best boy that ever my
master had, and when I've gone on working with him a bit, two or three
months, perhaps, mother,-time enough for him really to find out that
I am a good boy,--I will tell him all about you and Teddy, and make
him understand that if he wants to keep me in good heart to work, he
must let me trudge away home to pass a Sunday now and then with
you two. I dont think he'll be able to say no, mother, when I tell
him about Teddy's poor legs, and all you have done for us both, lying
a-bed here.''
Mrs. Armstrong again kissed her boy, and after gazing at him with
a look which pride and pleasure were strangely blended with an-
guise, she said, ``I do think you'll make your way, Michael-for
you are a good boy, a very good boy. But I don't know how poor
Edward will take it,''
That's the worst part of it, mother,'' replied the little fellow, be-
ginning to cry.  Poor Teddy does look so very happy of a night
when he sees me pop round the corner upon him, as he comes out of
the factory l-But then I shall be able to help him, mother, all the
better by and by. And when I come home of a Sunday, mother, I
must teach him to write, and then think how beautiful to have a letter
from one another1 I know who'll give me a slate for Teddy, and me
too, to learn with, and that's Miss Martha. And I shan't mind asking
her, not the least, because she knows I am going away. And do you
know, mother, i've got another notion, and that's no bad comfort
neither. I should not a bit wonder, if Miss MArtha was to turn out a
right good friend to you and Teddy, when I am gone.''
And so the little fellow ran on-each hopeful word he uttered be-
getting a new hope, till, by the time the hour of departure arrived, his
poor mother had at least the comfort of believing that the prospect
opening before him, was one that he looked upon with much less of
pain than pleasure.
MEanwhile Martha found her way safely home, and gave her father
such an account of the result of her mission, as induced him to give
her a kiss, and declare that if she was not the handsomest of the
family, she was out-and-out the most useful.

TRUE TALE.
It was not till the second dinner-bell had rung, that Mrs. Teletext
ventured to seek Mary in her chamber.
The worthy woman was perfectly aware that the naturally strong
or MICHAEL ARMsTRONG.
149
feelings of her young mistress had been violently affected by the scene
they had witnessed, and though far perhaps from comprehending the
effect it had produced on her mind, she was conscious that she should
do no good by protruding herself uncalled-for upon her retirement.
But when the signal that always brought them together had passed
unheeded, she became uneasy, and availing herself of the privilege
that long and well-required affection give, she knocked at her door
and called upon her name.
Miss Brotherton answered the summons immediately; but her with-
drawing the bolt of her door, as well as the unchanged appearance of her
dress, showed that she had not been occupied in preparing for dinner.
 You are not aware how late it is, my dear child. The second
dinner-bell has rung:'' said Mrs. Teletext looking anxiously in her pale
face.
Has it ?'' replied the young lady;  indeed, I beg yer pardon-
but I will not keep you waiting, I will not dress to-day if you will ex-
use it''
 No, no, my dear, that won't do. Never mind about the dinner
I will tell them to take it out again.''
Since I do not wish to dress,'' said Mary languilly. Morgan
will tease me by asking what dress I choose to wear and fifty questions
besides. Let me go down as I am, nurse Teletext.''
You shan't have Morgan at all dear. The dressing will refresh
you my darling child; and it won't be the first time Mary, that I have
done all that you wanted in that way. There-just sit down on the
sofa for one minute, and I will speak about the dinner, and be back
again.''
It was very passively that Mary did as she was bid, and without
another word of remonstrance sat down and awaited the return of her
old friend. She was indeed completely exhausted, the scene she has
witnessed had not touched only, it had wrung her heart; and the
hours she had passed since, were not such as to bring her spirits back
to their ordinary tone. It was not alone, the melancholy spectacle of
a fellow-creature passing from life to death, which had thus strongly
affected her-it was the frightful degradation of the group of human
beings who had gazed upon it with her. It was the horrible recollec-
tion of the dying woman's statement respecting the lacerated flesh of
her child-and it was the filth, the misery, the famine, and the vice
that she had been warned of, and had seen, which had set her power-
ful, healthy, prejudiced, and unselfish mind, to meditate upon the
state of things which had produced it.
It was hardly possible for any one to be more profoundly ignorant
upon the subject which had thus seized upon her heart, than was
Mary Brotherton. On the question of negro slavery she had from
her very earliest infancy heard a great deal, for her father was an anti-
(black)-slavery man, who subscribed to the African society, and the
missionary fund; drank Mt, Wilberforce's health after dinner when-
ever he had company at his table: and while his own mills daily sent
millions of groans to be registered in heaven from joyless young hearts

herself by the side of Miss Brotherton when the door again opened,
and Sophy Drake, leading a. little sister in each hand, entered the
drawing-room.
It required no force of contrast to render the miserable, squalid,
unhealthy appearance of these poor girls most painfully striking; if it
had, the elegant apartment into which they now entered would have
furnished it  Mary's heart smote her as she gazed upon them.  Sa
young-a petty tool'' thought she, `` and yet so painful to look
upon 1''
The eldest of the three looked languid, weary, spirit-broken, and
inanimate, hardly throwing a glance at the novel objects around  her,
and looking more fit to lie down and rest the aching limbs she slowly
ragged along, than to indulge any feeling of curiosity: The little
ones had the same unsteady tired gait, but they looked up with an
expression of wonder, and almost of awe, on every object as they passed
along.''
How are you all, my poor girls?'' said Mary kindly, as they drew
near to her. The eldest girl dropped a courtesy but made no audible
reply.
It is so sad and hopeless a grief to lose a mother,'' continued Miss
DBrotherton, `` that I can say not one word to check your grief. BUt
if there is any thing that I can do to make you more comfortable, 1
shall be glad to do it. You see all of you greatly in want of
clothes. How cones that, when so many of the family work, and get
wages2''
 The wages isnt enough to buy us real, ma'am,'' replied the
eldest girl, and help pay lodging rent.
This statement seemed so very incredible, that Mary felt a painful
conviction that the young creature before he was not speaking truth.
sHe remained silent for a minute or two, and then said, ` I suppose
when you sy bread you mean good of all kinds?-and tea, and sugar,
and butter, and so on?'' said Mary.
I have not had the taste of meat in my mouth for above these two
years,'' replied Sophy colouring, and in a voice that seemed to indi-
cate something like indignation-` and as to sugar in our tea, or butter
on our bread, no factory child is brought up to it''
.Mary coloured too. She longed to get accurate information re-
spending their manner of living, and the reasons why incessant labour
failed to supply the necessities of Life ; but she knew not well how to
set about it.
 Do not be angry with me, Bochy,'' said she,  if I ask questions
that seem unfeeling and very ignorant. I really know little or nothing
about the manner in which poor people live, and I want to know. Not
merely from curiosity, but because I should like to help them if 1
could,'
`And Gol knows we want help bad enough, ma'am,'' replied the
girl, while tears started to her eyes. ` Father has got the money to
gave yesterday, and we shall never hear any more of that.''
 Is he a bad father to you then ?'
154
THE LIFE AND ADYETnRES
 Not bal to beatus. But he drinks terrible,'
 Then I suppose his wages ge partly in that?'
 His wages, and our'n too, ma'am. He paint always able to
get work. The old hands are often out, and then in course he takes
our'n,''
` Then if he was a temperate, steady man, you would do a great
deal better'
 In course we should, ma'am. Dut mother said he took to it, as
most of the others do in all the mills, on account of having to come
home so, when we young ones comes in from work. I have heard mother
say that father cried when I, that was the biggest, com'd home first
beaten and bruised with the strap and the billy-roller.''
 WHat is the billy-roller, Sophy'' inuired Miss Brotherton, in an
accent denoting considerable curiosity.
iT's a long stout stick, ma'am, that's used often and often to beat
the little ones employed in the mills when their strength fails-when
they fall asleep, or stand still for a minute,''
 Do you mean, that the children work till they are so tired as to
Fall asleep standing?
 Yes, ma'am. Dozens and dozens of 'em every day in the year
except Sundays, is strapped, and kicked, and banned by the billy-
roller, because they falls asleep.'
But, surely, parents are greatly to blame, to let children young
enough for that, go to work at all?
 They must just starve, ma'am, if they didn't,'' replied the girl
: How many years have you worked in the factory yourself
Sophy?'
 Just twelve, ma'am, this last spring.''
And how old are you?'
 Seventeen, ma'am.''
 Twelve from seventeen ?--You mean to say that you began to
work at the factory when you were five years old?'' said Mary, with
ome appearance of incredulity.
I was five years and three months, mama,'' answered the gil
firmly.
MIss Brotherton looked at Mrs. Teletext, but perceived no appear-
ance of incredulity on her countenance. `` Is this possible, Mrs.
Reflect?'' said she.
 Yes, my lear, I believe that it is very common,'' replied the old
woman. `' I have often heard it spoken of among the servants.''
Have you ever been at school, Sophy?''
t Yes, ma'am. Afore father changed his mill and took work under
Sir Matthew we all-father, mather, Grace, Dick, and all, worked for
the great maker gentleman, Joseph Tell, and he had a school in the
factory for Sundays.''
``And ou learnt to real there of course?'
' No, ma'am, I didn't;'' replied the girl, shaking her head.
WHose fault was that, my dear 3-Surely if you were put to school,
you ought to have learnt to read1'

156
THE LIFE AND AD VENTURES
upon respecting the system by which the factory labor is regulated,
that is quite hopeless.''
She felt, however, that the weary-looking group ought not to return
empty-handed after their walk, with no reward for it but her promises:
and turning to MIrs. Teletext, asked her in a half whisper what she
could give them, that might be made immediately useful in the way of
clothing; their garments being in a condition that it was painful to
her to behold.
You might give them that piece of dark cotton, my dear, that you
bought the other day for the coaching's children. There is no great
hurry you know about them, for they are not to go to school till next
month,''
 Very true.-It is just the thing,'' replied Mary; and having run
the bell and ordered her maid to appear, she gave orders to have it
brought to her.
I do not exactly know how much there is of it, Sophy,'' said she,
putting it into her hand, `` but enough, I think, for one or two of you,
and I will get more of the same sort when next I go to Ashleigh.''
opry took it with a courtesy; but having held it for a moment
said,  Please, ma'am, this won't be no use to me, unless I may pawn
part to get the rest made,''
 Can you not make a gown for yourself and your sisters, my good
girl?'' demanded Mary.
 Please, ma'am, l never was learnt to sew,'' replied the girl,
blushing.
More convinced than ever, that her first effort to assist the poor
operatives, had led her by an unlucky chance into a family, whose
authority habits made it almost hopeless to attempt doing them any
essential service, Mary drew forth her purse, and giving has-a-crown
to each of them, took the useless material back, saying, : I will send
you some ore decent clothes to wear, fSophsy-and then we must
think what further can be done for you and these poor little ones.
But, indeed, my dear girl, I greatly fear that unless your habits are
improved, and that you can be taught to use your needle like all other
decent young women, in making and mending what is given you, it
will be impossible for me, or for any one to do you much good.''
Poor Sophy Drake looked both sorry and ashamed as she listened to
this reproof,-but she attempted not to answer in, and again courtesy-
ing as she received the money, she turned away without again speak-
in, and left the room.
This is very, very dreadful 1 nurse Triplett,'' said Mary, as soon
as they were alone. I could not have believed that it was possible
in such a country as England, to find human beings in a state of such
degraded ignorance as that poor girl. Did you ever meet with any
thing like it before?''
I can't say, Miss Mary, that s ever before came within reach of
hearing a factory-girl speak so much as i have heard to-day. But can't
pretend to say that I am a bit surprised. I told you, my dear, from
o MICHAEL ARMSTRONG.
151
the beginning, that you would only get yourself into trouble, and do
no good. From the very first of my coming to this country, which
was but a month before i came to live with your mamma, I always heard
the same history of the factory folks. And you know, my dear, what
every body says, must be true.''
hIlary, as she listened to this, looked harassed, puzzled, and
wretched. ` But is it not something unheard of in the history of the
world,'' said she, '` that thousands and hundreds of thousands of
persons should exist, all labouring, young and old, with unceasing
industry to support themselves, and that this their painful labour
should subject them to such habits of inevitable ignorance and de-
gradation, that all decent and respectable persons must be taught to
shun thc ?'
It does seem very harl upon them, my dear, to be sure,'' replied
her companion; `` but as to why it is so, i am sure it is impossible for
us to guess. It must be partly their own faults of course; but at any
at, my dear, I wish you would not go on, working yourself up so.
I can't ear to see you, Miss Mary, looking vexed and miserable for
what you can't help the least bit in the world. And besides, my dear,
I must say, that it is nowise right for a young lady like you to run
the risk of getting ncar very bad people indeed, whose ways I don't
like to talk to you about. I know you can't abide Sir Matthew
Dowling, and I can't say I ever saw or heard of much to like in him;
but for all that, there is not any good that I can see in disbelieving
what he told us about these very people. He must know more about
them than we can, and it was quite shocking I do assure you, Miss
Mary, the things he told me. A great deal too bad to repeat, I
promise you.''
Mary burst into tears. `I am very unhappy, Mrs. Triplett,'' said
she, `` and it is not putting faith in Sir Matthew Dowling that can
make me less so. That I may be led to do many things from my great
ignorance, which were lI better informed I should not do, is very likely;
and it is therefore my duty to obtain information upon this tremendous
subject as speedily as possible. Would to God, my good friend, that
you could give it mel but as you cannot, we will cease to speculate
together upon what we neither of us understand. I am sorry that our
awful adventure yesterday, prevented my purposed visit to the poor
woman in Huxley-lane. We both agreed, you know, that I could get
no harm there; and I have an object in view in making that visit that
I am sorry to have delayed. We will go there to-morrow, nurse
Teletext,-and so early in the morning, as to run no risk of meeting any
of the fine folks who love to show themselves on the Ashleigh road.''
Mary Drotherton did go early the following morning to Huxley-lane.
But her visit was too late, by exactly twenty-four hours.

likely she would be unhappy if we. persuaded her, let it turn out as it
would,''
Instead of answering, Sir Matthew suddenly wheeled round, and
looked out of the window, as if the bit of stony mould extending
ten feet deep to the ditch that fenced it, contained something of peru-
liar interest and curiosity. During this interval, which lasted about a
minute, the widow Armstrong again fixed her eyes pon the face of
Martha, with an appealing look that seemed to implore assistance from
her judgment, while it evidently expressed confidence in her kindness.
When Sir Matthew again permitted his countenance to be visible to
them, it expressed nothing but indifference; but Martha thought it was
such an easy good -natured sort of indifference that there could be no
danger in bringing him back to the subject, even though he said as he
turned round, ` Come, my dear Martial, l cannot stay another moment,
I do assure you.''
1 am quite ready, papa,'' she replied; `'but don't you think it is
almost a pity to let such an opportunity be lost for poor Michael ?''
 Certainly it is, my dear,'' he replied in the most good-humoured
accent imaginable.  But what would you have me do, y dear child?
Depend upon it there is no real charity in assisting people against
their will, or in a manner in any way contrary to their inclinations.
You know perfectly well, that it was my real and sincere wish that this
good woman's child should be well provided for. An opportunity for
doing this, better far than I could have hoped for, is now proposed
but evidently does not meet her wishes. Unfortunately l must send
the answer by to-day's post, and surely you would not recommend me
to accept this situation for the boy, excellent as it is, against his
mother's wil] g
 No papa-only it seems to me that Mrs. Armstrong has not quite
made up her mind about it; and I thought perhaps that a few minutes'
consideration might enable her to perceive how great a loss it would be
to Michael were she to refuse it.''
 Wall, Martha'' returned the knight with a sort of course sigh,
and at the same time seating himself on one of the widow's treasured
rush-bottomed chairs,  I would rather make the person l expect wait
at Dowling Lodge for an hour, than either disappoint your kind heart,
or hurry this good woman into saying any thing that she does not really
mean. What does the little fellow himself say about it?'
He's grateful and thankful, sir, for what is offered to him, and
willing he is to accept it.-'Tis oly my poor weak seek heart that has
got no courage lef in it. You think, miss, he had better take it1' she
added, turning her anxious eyes non martha.
For a moment Martha felt a repugnant to the taking upon herself,
as it were, the responsibility of the transaction, but an exclamation
from her father settled the business at once.
 Poor soul'' said he. '` Low natural is this weakness1 Give her,
by your advice, the strength she wants, MArtha-it is the most valuable

Killed papa is very right, Mrs. Armstrong,'' said Martha cheer-

 HEre Parsons, sign away l'' said Sir Matthew gaily,. as he with-
drew the document from the bed. The ready servant obeyed, and his
fellow-driver followed his example, without waiting for any further
instructions.
 Now then, Martha, let us be of'' cried the knight, moving to-
wards the door as he pocketed the papers. But stopping suddenly
before he opened it he said, `` By the way, Parsons, as chance has
brought you here, we may as well make use of you about getting a
few necessities for our little stocking-weaver. We must trust to you
to get whatever may be wanted. He may take the clothes he has worn
at the lodge, for Sundays, but of course they would not be suitable for
him to work in.''
 Very well, Sir Matthew, I will see about it,'' replied the important
overlooked.
1 must have no time lost, if you please'' rejoined his master rather
sharply: `` for Mr. Elwood hampton mentioned in his letter, that he
should be having some of his people passing this way who might
take charge of him, and I am sure i can't say when they may happen
to call. So go directly into the town, Parsons, and buy whatever you
think the boy may want. I dare say this will be very nearly the last
expense, Mrs. Armstrong,'' he added, `' that I shall be put to for him,
and I assure you that I shall pay it very willingly.''
With these words he left the room, and Martha pronouncing a short
but kind farewell, followed him. Soon after she had overtaken him,
and again passed her arm through his, she was started by a violent
burst of laughter, and on looking back, perceived at no great distance
behind them, Parsons and his companion, taking their way over a style
that led by a short cut to Rockford factory. iT was from them the
hearty laugh hal proceeded.

AT DowLIG LODGE, UT FAILS U MOULTING wIIAT SHE wET O.
As soon as Miss Brotherton and Mrs. Teletext had finished their
breakfast on the morning alter the interview with Sophy Drake in the
drawing-room at Milford Park, they set of together on foot to visit the
widow Armstrong in Huxley-lane.
 Nothing can happen to us worse than our adventure in the car-
ridge the day before yesterday,'' observed the young lady; `` you will
confess, dear friend, will you not, that Sir Matthew's walking into the
r 2

carriage was more terrible than any thing likely' to befall us on the
high-road without one?''
 Why, 1 suppose I must, my lear,'' answered the old lady; ` for
to tell you the truth, I don't think you could look more put out of a
constable were to come up and arrest you.''
Decidedly not, Mrs. melchett: and listen to the birds, and sniff
the sweet air, and then tell me if we are not wise to walk 2''
he oId woman confessed that she really did enjoy it, and on they
went with the gardener's of or a guide, till in less than an hour they
found themselves before the door of No. 12, in Huxley-lane. Pro-
baby their little pioneer was not one of the widow's visitors, for the
pass through the hedge, falling to the back-kitchen doo appeared
unknown to him, and in answer to Miss Brotherton's knock for admit-
dance, the principal entrance to No. l2 was opened by the ragged
distress of the tenemcnt.
Does the widow Armstrong live here?'' inquired Mary. ss Yes,
ma'am,'' observed the woman gloomily; continuing as she made way
for the ladies to enter, The widow Armstrong is a lucky woman-
she has not but one child left to provide for, and yet the gentlefolks
keeps coming to help her, but nobody thinks of me and my ten young
ones.''
The ready hand of Miss Brotherton was immediately in her purse.
 That is a large family indeed, my good woman. Are they none of
the old enough to help themselves ?''
:The seven oldest have all been in the factory from almost the time
they could stand ma'am,'' replied MIrs. Sykes, `` and if they hadn't,
they must have been deal and buried long ago for want of bread. But
though they have worked poor returns, early and late, there's no more
come of it, than that their bones be here instead of in the churchyard.''
But with so large a number, all receiving wages,'' said Miss bRo-
theron, gently, 1 should have hoped that you might have found
yourselves better off than you seem to be.''
` And that's what we are told, mama, from years and to years and,
and we must bear it, for there is no help. bUt 'is a'most as bitter as
the work that grinds us,''
Neither the person or manner of Mrs, Sykes were in any degree
prepossessing; she was dirty, and in every way untidy in the extreme.
She had on her feet the fragments of a pair of men's shoes, but no
stockings, the rest of her clothing being barely sufficient to cover her.
Her eye, voice, and complexion, furnished strong indications of her
being accustomed to take spirits, while her frightfully thin limbs gave
her the appearance of being half starved. In short, it was impossible
to look at her without feeling that she was a degraded, as well as a
suffering being. Mary Drotherton did feel this, and her heart sunk
within her as she thought of Sophy Drake, of her drunken father, and
of all Mrs. Streets had told her respecting the vice, which like a
wide-spreading and hideous epidemic, seemed to ravage in all direct-
tions the miserable neighbourhood in which fate had placed her. She
shuttered as she contemplated the wretched being that stood before

her, and till she had spoken the words given above, a deep feeling of
the woman's unworthiness chilled the ready pity of her warm young
heart. BUt both in these words themselves, and in the tone of quiet
settled despair in which they were spoken, there was a frightful and
mysterious allusion to some species of injustice and cruelty, under
which accusation she seemed herself to he included.
The distaste and reprobation that were a moment before making
hasty inroads upon her benevolence, seemed suddenly arrested as she
listened: and she was about to repeat again the questions she had
already so endlessly asked, as to whence this universal severity of
judgment against the factory labourers arose; and wherefore, beyond
all others, submitted to the sentence which doom human beings to
toil, these people should appear to loath their employment, and exe-
crate, as it should seem, the very means by which they lived. But are
her lips opened to demand the explanation to while the so eagerly
desired to listen, a glance at the hard features of the wretched woman
checked her. ' It cannot be from such as these,'' thought she, `` that
truth and instruction can be reasonably' looked for''-and as she
silently gave her arms, and moved onwards towards the door which
had been pointed to, as that of the widow Armstrong, something like
a systematic project for making herself mistress of the knowledge she
wanted, for the first time suggested itself to her imagination.
Mrs. Sykes eyed the silver largesse, as it fell into her hand, with a
glance that seemed to devour it, and the words of thanks she uttered
were almost hysterical in their eager vehemenee. After delaying a
moment for the contemplation of this precious '' drudge 'twist man and
man,'' she opened the door of communication, and Miss Brotherton
and her friend passed into the dwelling-room of the widow Armstrong.
Contrary to custom, her lame boy, Edward, was sitting on the side
of her bed, and when MAry entered, he was holding her hand, and
gazing in her face with an expression of countenance which appeared
to both the intruders to be the most tenuous they had ever looked upon.
The poor child was looking, to, most wretched ill, and the first idea
which suggested itself was, that he felt himself to be dying.
Notwithstanding the extreme poverty of the widow Armstrong, there
was an air of decency and decorum about her, that might in any situ-
tion have commanded respect; but when contrasted with the appear-
ance of her neighbour, seemed to indicate a claim to more observance
than her visitors were showing by this sudden and uninvited entrance.
I beg your pardon, Mrs. Armstrong,'' said Mary. gently, for
breaking in upon you so abruptly; and I fear our doing so may have
started your sick child.-This little fellow is very ill, 1 fear.''
 It is long since he has known health, ma'am,'' replied the widow;
`` but it is not that which makes him look so while and trembling
now. We have lost what was dearer to us both than all the world
beside-and though I don't think as this one will ever look np again,
I can't find a word in my heart to comfort him l''
 WHat, then, has happened to you?'' said Mary, with much inte-
rest-'` Nothing bad to your son Michael, I hope2''
166
ThE LIFE AND ADVENTURES
 You know Michael, ma'am ?'' said the poor woman, anxiously.
:tO have seen him at Sir Matthew Doling's,'' she replied.
:sI wish you never had, a'man 1' rejoined the widow, bitterly-
 We were only starving before, button we are worse than that.''
 Do explain to me what you mean, Mrs. Armstrong,'' said
Mary.
I ought to do it, ma'am, for you speak kindly; and that's a claim
poor folks san seldom withstand,.-But how can I tell you the matter,
ma'am ? I know nothing-and that's the reason why poor Edward and
I are so miserable.''
 But that is a bad way to get into, my god MIrs. Armstrong,'' said
Mary, cheerfully.  Don't fret yourself about fancied evils, which
perhaps do not exist. Little Edward here should know better than
that,
The pale, brokenhearted boy looked at her with lack-lustre eyes,
but said nothing.
 Are you uneasy because Michael has not been down to see you
lately?'' resumed Miss Brotherton.
 He never failed to come, ma'am, till he was carried away from us 1'
replied the widow, with a job, that seemed the result of strength ex-
haunted, and weakness that could struggle no longer.
Carried away from you I'' tried Mary, changing colour.  What
do you mean, MIrs. Armstrong? who has carried away Michael from
you 7''
Sir Matthew Dowling, ma'am, has had him taken away,'' and
another sob followed the words.
Do not think I torment you thus from idle curiosity,'' pursued
Mary, bending over her; `but I entreat you to explain to me fully
what to mean. I am greatly interested for your little boy.''
ttI thank you for it, ma'am,'' returned the poor mother, mournful;
but I can tell little that you, or any grand lady, the friend of Sir
Matthew, would think to the purpose. Yet the parting with him with-
out one blessing, or one kiss, is hard to bear, though we don't justly
know that any harnr's to come to him.''
1I am no particular friend of Sir Matthew Dowling's,'' replied
Mary, with an accent which perhaps spoke more than her words.
Then I will tell you about Michael'' exclaimed the game boy,
coming round the bed to the place where she was standing, and look-
in into her face as if he thought he could read all her thoughts there.
t You have seen poor Mike when he was living there, ma'am?''
 Yes, I have, my dear boy,'' she replied, gazing with deep feeling
at his pale, but beautiful countenance;  I have seen him there more
than once, EDward, and I am quite sure he was not happy, though he
was dressed so fine.''
 He was more unhappy ten times over,'' replied Edward, '` than
when he was as ragged as me.''
 WVas he unkindly treated ?'' demanded Mary.
He was beaten, kicked, and spit upon1'' tried Elward, bursting
into tears; ` and then he was told to laugh, and look merry.''
o MICHAEL ARM9StrONG.
167
A wretched, wretched, sort of cruelty1'' she replied, `` of which I
can well believe Sir Matthew capable. bUt you surely do not suppose
that he has run away from it without telling you or his mother that he
had such an intention ?2'
If you knew Mike better, ma'am, you wouldn't think that he could
do such wickedness,'' said the mother. He has stood beating with strap
and stick for years, ma'am, young as he is: and never asked to stop
from the mill a day, though he has been bruised almost to a jelly;-and
worse than that, too, poor lamb a hundred fold, with such a heart as
his, he has seen his lame brother there, that was always dearer, a
great deal, to him than himself-he has seen the cruel stripes fall on
his poor shoulders, too: and though he has come home with his little
face washed with tears from it, he didn't think of running away.''
Mary saw that she had given pain, and hastened to atone for it by
expressing her sorrow for supposing such a thing possible; and then
repeated her request, that she might be told what it was that had
happened.
The widow then related more succinctly than might have been ex-
pectel, all that had passed between herself, her boy, and Miss Martha
Dowling, on the morning which followed the theatrical representation
at Dowling Lodge. And before she proceeded further, Edward bore
testimony to the spirited and courageous willingness with which his
brother had adopted the proposed scheme. He had, it seemed, as
usual, watched Teddy's return from the factory-told him what Sir
Matthew proposed doing for him, and declared, that hard as it would
be to part with him and '' mother,'' he was ready and willing to start,
and was quite determined to be the best boy that ever was 'prentice,
and to be workman enough to maintain them both as soon as his time
w8 Out.
Here the widow again resumed her narrative, and related very ae-
accurate the scene of the following morning; dwelling much on the
young lady's kind manner, and on her own putting it to her whether
she advised that the child should go, or not.
'And Martha Dowling counselled you to let him go?'' demanded
Miss Brotherton.
es, again and again, she did,'' replied the poor mother.
:You are quite sure it was Miss Martha2''
t Oh, yes1 ma'am; my Mike took care to make me understand that,
the day they came together,''
 Then be quite easy in your mind, MIrs. Armstrong,'' said Mary,
eagerly. :I have no great liking for Sir Matthew bOwling. I do
not think well of him, nor have I much to say in favour of any of his
family. They seem to me to the cold-hearted, selfish people. But on
this one, this Miss Martha that you speak of, I will undertake to an-
sewer for it that she has never deceived you, and that if she advised you
to let Michael go, it was because she thought the doing so would be
advantageous for him,''
to Bless you for ever and for ever, ma'am:'' cried MIrs. Armstrong,
seizing the hand of Mary, and pressing it to her lips.  There is
168
A LIFE AND ADVENTURES
truth, mama, in your voice, and in journeys. Do as I do, Edward,
dear1 look at the kind face of this young lady, and see if you can't
find comfort from what she says? I did think, myself, ignorant as I
am, that the young lady had an honest fact. But, ohl ma'am, let it
be as it will, and make the very best of it, 'is cruel to have our
darling taken away in this fashion, without one word of take-leave and
blessing :''
'Indeed i is1'' replied Mary; ``and your being ignorant of the
place of his destination increases this anxiety. But on this point, at
least, I think I shall be able to set your mind at rest. Before this
time to-morrow, I will take care to see some part of the family at the
Lodge, and shall certainly not scruple to inquire every particular re-
setting your boy. Keep up your spirits therefore, both of you; and
for the future, let this little fellow here look to me for his wages. I
won't have him go to the factory any more. What sum has he been
receiving for his work 2''
Astonishment very literally rendered the widow Armstrong dumb,
on hearing this most extraordinary proposal. Poor soul1 a few short
days ago it would have been sufficient to make her forget her weak-
ness and her want, and have put her in a state of mind that queens
might envy; for she would hardly have been able to remember that it
was possible to have another wish; but now the first use she made on
recovering her speech, was to exclaim,  Oh1 Michael : Michael I why
meant to by to hear this2''
He shall hear it, Mrs. Armstrong,'' sail Mary, in a voice of such
cheerful confidence, that the terrors of both mother and son seemed to
vanish before it. Mrs. Teletext, too, ventured to add an encouraging
commentary upon MAry's promised visit of inquiry at the Lodge, of-
serving, that it was altogether out of probability that they should want
to make any mystery as to where the little fellow was gone.
Mrs. Armstrong, as she listened, seemed almost too happy to credit
the evidence of her own senses; but in the deep-set melancholy eye
of Edward, there was still an expression of suffering and of fear that
looked as if misery had taken a hold upon him that could not be re-
relinquish.
 Now I must goi'' said the young lady, rising, ``or I shall hardly
have time to keep my promise. But I must settle with you first, my
dear boy. What was the amount of your wages by the month ?''
 Six shillings, ma'am,'' replied Edward, looking at her, as she
drew out her purse, with an eye that seemed to doubt what it beheld.
Six shillings'' cried MIss Bratherton, as she put the pitiful wage
of a long month's agony into the lille trembling hand. ``And have you
lost your health and liberty for this'' Tears started to her eyes, as
she contemplated the look of wonder and delight expressed by the
countenance of the poor widow; yet that look was not turned upon
her. Stretching out her arms to the boy, she caught him to her to-
some, and held him there, much as if she had suddenly beheld him
snatched from the fans of soe devouring monster. . The face of the

child himself, she could not see, but his whole frame trembled, and
they iancied he was shedding tears.
gOd bless you both1'' she said, `` to-morrow you shall see me
again.'' And so saying she took the arm of her friend, and again
used through the dwelling-room of Mrs. Sykes. The woman had
no three little dirty creatures round her, to whom she was giving
bread.
` Heaven keep you, ma'all This is your treat.'' she said, as
MAry and her friend passed through, ` it is the first time for many a
week that I have fed em so freely, poor returns.''
Miss Brotherton's heart was too full to answer-she noted her
head and passed on. Their homewnrd walk, up Huxley-lane, across
the London road, and along a pretty shaded ridge-road that led to.a
gate in her own park-palin, was performed almost entirely in silence.
There is a state of mind in which ideas come with too much violence
and rapidity to be told of in words. When this happens from an
excess of happy imaginings, no condition can be more delightful: but
when, as in the present case, it arises from the remembrance of painful
realities, it is greatly the reverse. The misery around her was  no
Longer a matter of double speculation, but of most frightful cer-
tainty. Neither was it any vice in lille Edward Armstrong, which
drove him to offer up his sickly suffering frame to ceaseless labour at
the rate of threepence for each long, painful day. She felt oppressed,
overwhelmed, and almost hopeless. Yet at that time Mary Brotherton
knew not, guessed not, dreamed not, of the hundredth part of what
the unhappy class who had thus roused her human sympathies, were
daily and hourly suffering around her.
The first words she spoke on entering her house were to order her
carriage, and having gone so far in the performance of the task she
had undertaken, she turned with tender kindness to her old friend,
and gave as much care to her comfort and refreshment, as if the real-
time situation which they had borne to each other in days of yore was
set reversed, and that Mary was the nurse, and Mrs. Teletext the
nursing.
' You shall do nothing more before dinner, my dear good soul, hut
lie down upon the sofa, and get cool. Not even Ms. Gabberly, I
9oppose, could see any thing particularly dangerous and improper, in
my being alone to pay a visit to Martin Dowling.''
And alone to Dowling Lodge the heiress went, pretty steadfastly
determined not to leave it, till she had learnt exactly at what point of
the earth's surface Michael Strong might be found.
She inquire for Martha, and was shown as usual into my Lady's
morning drawing-room, where to her extreme annoyance she found her
classic, Sir Mathew, Lady Clarissa Sharpton, and MIss Moog-
If Lady Dowling could have been glad to see any pretty young
lady, it would have been Miss Brotheriton, and she did exert herself,
more than usual, to be civil; while, on the contrary, Sir Matthew both
felt and evinced considerably less satisfaction at the sight of her, that
he had ever done since the fact of her heiress-ship had become matter


172
THE LIFE AND ADVENTURE8
little fellow. And now I hope you will tell me also to what part of
the country he has been sent.''
1 would tell you in a moment, if I knew, my dear Miss Brother-
to, but i do not. His departure at last was very sudden; owing,
I believe, to papa's having found some particularly good opportunity
of sending him.''
eI wonder you should never have asked where he was sent to, Miss
Martha,'' said Mary, gravely.
I did ask, Miss Brotherton,'' replied Martha; '` but papa said he
could not recollect the name of the place,''
:::'::
he may have recollected it, since, my dear-I wish you would run in,
and ask him to come to me for a moment.''
Martha seemed to hesitate. I am sure,'' said she, after a little
hesitation, ` that papa would be delighted to come here to talk with
you, Miss Brotherton-only Lady Clarissa might-''
Nay, then, I'll go to him myself,'' said Mary, rather abruptly.
tHere is no particular objection, I suppose, to Lady Clarissa's being
let into the secret of little Michael's abode.'' And immediately turn-
in her steps towards the house, she re-entered the drawing-room, fol-
lower by MArtha.
They found Sir Matthew engaged in exhibiting a portfolio of spleen-
did engravings to her ladyship, who was descending upon them with
rapture; though the application of a near-sighted glass to one
long-sighted eye, while the other was effectually closed, rendered them
pretty nearly invisible to her.
1 beg ten thousand pardons, Sir Matthew,'' said the heiress, placing
herself at the opposite side of the low-table, and thereby commanding
a perfect view of his countenance; `` but you are too goodnatured, i am
sure, to be angry with me, even though I do interrupt you. Will you
have the kindness to tell me, sir, while Lady Clarissa is lost in admi-
ration of that enchanting Venus, where little Michael Armstrong has
been sent to?''
The question was too unexpected for even Sir Matthew's sturdy self-
possession, to receive it as he would have wished to do. His bold eye,
which had been gaily fixed on the young lady, as she spoke to him,
fell before her keen, inquiring glance, and he turned the pages of Lady
Clarissa's adoration with rather unseemly rapidly. as he replied, `` To
a tradesman-that is, to a manufacturer, some miles further north,
Miss Brotherton. I have just been telling Lady Clarissa,'' continued
the knight, recovering his audacity, :I have just been telling her all
the little fellow's adventures. The love of novelty seemed to have su-
persuade all other love in his young least, for he was delighted to go.''
?BUt he could not have liked going without taking leave of his
mother and brother, Sir MAtthew. I he just seen them, and they
are in a perfect agony about him-in fact, I am come here on purpose
to ask where he has been sent,''
oE MiCHAEL ARMsTRONG.
173
Fairest of messengers'' exclaimed the knight, with a tender smile,
`` how utterly miserable shall I be if I cannot answer you-I think it
is to Halifax, I am almost urethra it is either to Halifax or Wakefield
that he is gone.''
 You have found the little fellow apprentice, you do not know
where?'' said Miss Brotherton, with undisguised astonishment.
I do not say that, my dear young lady, I know he is apprenticed
to an excellent good man, who is a stocking-weaver; but he has two
or three large concerns belonging to him, and I protest to you that at
this moment I really cannot say to which this little fellow has been
sent.''
I am quite shocked to give you so much trouble, Sir Matthew,''
returned Mary, `` but I should be exceedingly obliged if you would
learn the name of the place, and let me know it. I venture, sir, to
promise the boy's mother that I would learn this for her, and I am
a(quite sure that you will not let me disappoint her.''
t' Most assuredly not1 I will call or send to-morrow at the latest, my
charming MIss DBrotherton How I adore your benevolence? No
wonder you are such friends, Lady Clarissa Our hearts are made
upon the same model 1'
To this satisfactory assurance liss Brotherton made no answer;
but telling Sir Matthew that she should remain at home on the morrow
for the purpose of receiving his promised information, took her leave.
With increased dislike of Sir Matthew, perhaps, yet with no very
serious fears about the fate of little michael, Miss Brotherton hardly
determined to brave all the wonder which the act might occasion, and
ordered her carriage to stop at No. 12, Huxley-lane, Ashleigh.
As it happened, however, she escaped all her military admirers, and
reached the widow Armstrong without interruption; the absorbing
mills were in full activity, and few of the inhabitants of the miserable
region through which she passed were left to gaze on the unwanted
spectacle. The answer she brought was received by the widow and
her boy with breathless attention; but it was quite evident that it did
not altogether remove the sort of vague terror which seemed to have
taken possession of them. Mary's cheerful assurance, however, that
she should soon bring them more satisfactory intelligence, could not
be listened to without good affect; and she left them at last so in-
finitely happier than she had found them, that spite of Sir Matthew's
unsatisfactory reply, and more unsatisfactory manner, she still blessed
her morning's work,

AnD where was little Michael? The indentures, when duly signed
and executed, did not remain two hours in Sir MAtthew Doling's
possession before he began to put in action the power they gave him.
Mr. Joseph Parsons perfectly understood the nature of the ``few ne-
estuaries'' which he was commanded to procure for the young stocking-
weaver; and accordingly, by the time Sir Matthew had taken leave of
Martha in the hall, after their walk back from Huxley-lane, his confi-
dental agent was ready to attend him in his study.
 No, Mr. Parsons, I flatter myself that you will allow I have
managed this business tolerably well. My excellent friend, Elwood
Sharpton, will owe me a good turn-for, thanks to the meddling of
old Sir Robert, 'prentice-boys are not so easily got as they used to be
-and you and I, M. Parsons, have got rid of a most infernal spy.
Now then, to business. How soon can you set off with him 2''
: As soon as a horse can be harnessed to the jockey-cart, Sin
Matthew.''
The jockey-cart 1-the devil: WHat a fool you are, Parsons1
Have you really no more it in you than to propose setting off, willy-
nilly, with this young cur, that helped at the rate he did the other
night, before all the fine folks in the county, in an open jockey-cart:
Fie, Mr. Parsons, feel-I really had a better opinion of your under-
standing.''
 1I thought he was going to set off, at any rate, by his own free
will, Sir Matthew,'' replied the superintendent, `` and I knew when
we got among the moors, it wouldn't much matter to me, if he did
sing out.''
 You are an excellent fell, Parsons-true to the backbone,
and as firm as a rock-but don't you ever undertake to carry through
such a pretty little kidnapping scheme as this, where every thing is to
be done according to law, unless you have got the help of a little such
stuff as this,'' and the knight touched his own forehead expressively
as he spoke.
 here's few men as wouldn't be the better for a little of that, Sir
Matthew,'' returned the judicious Parsons with a submissive nod;
 but I'm ready and willing to do your bidding, be it what it may,
and that's the best way of putting your honour's it to profit,''
 You are right there, my good fellow-one captain is always better
than two. But, however, as to master Michael, Parsons, we must
neither let him stay loitering here till his dainty mother has questioned
all the gossip who will come to rate with her about her boy, and

 WEll now, don't he look like as well-behaved and pretty a young
gentleman as one would wish to see'' continued the farmer, turning
to the young girl, `` and yet there's no mistaking that t'other's his
master,''
t Fine feathers makes finebirds,. for them as can see no farther,''
cried Parsons contemptuous, and turning one of his threatening
school upon the old man. uas at a li German Goose,` and
you'll find out perhaps, as all is not gold as glitters.''
' Poor little follo ?'' exclaimed the farmers, on meeting the super
intendent's ill-omened eye.:  I wish, with all my heart, master, that
nobody cared no more for yur ugly looks than 1 do.''
Dame Pritchard,'' said Parsons, without appearing to hear him,
Lot the boy and we have a bit of supper, d'ye hear. Spite of his
fine clothes, however, which were but a gift of charity, the boy is
neither better or worse, than one of our factory children.''
I would not have thought it'' said the old man, apparently satis-
fied, and turning to his mug.
 No, I dare say,'' retorted Parsons, with a sneer.  Such chaps as
you, seldom finds out what's what, or who's who, before they are told.''
From this moment no further interest was expressed about little
Michael. IIe was factory boy, and what good was there in asking
any further questions So a thick slice of bread, and a scrap of bacon
were set before him, and as soon as the more elaborate supper of MIr.
Parsons was concluded, he with great affability took the little fellow
by the hand, and preceded by Dame Pritchard and a candle, con-
ducted him to a pallet bed in the same chamber as his own.
For the first moment after he was left alone with the boy, the
superintendent felt a strong inclination to make him pay for the
affront he had been the cause of his receiving below. But the same
wisdom which had cut short his indignation there, checked him now;
an having locked the chamber door, and given Michael a stimulating
kick to hasten his undressing, he carefully packed in a bundle the
Dowling Lodge suit which he took off, leaving in its place beside the
bed, the result of his hasty shoppings at Ashleigh.
WHen roused from his slumbers at day-break the following morn-
ing, Michael found these new garments ready for him, and for a
moment his heart sunk at the change, for though new, they were of
the very lowest kind, and formed as strong a contrast as was well
possible with the dress he had lid site on preparing for his night's
rest. But the human mind will often show symptoms of philosophy
even at ten years old; which truth was made evident by the manner
in which the young apprentice invested himself in his new suit, cheer-
in his spirit as he did so, with the recollection that a person going to
bc bound to a trade like that of stocking-weaving, would look very
ridiculous in such a dress as had been just taken away from him.
Early as it was, Mrs, Pritchard was ready in the kitchen with'a
pot of hot tea'' for Mr. Parsons; Michael received a fitting hunch of
bread, the covered cart was brought up to the door, and the ill-matched
pair set off again upon their journey.

For about another half mile, the narrow cart-road runs beside the
stream without encountering any single object, except its lofty barrier.
and the book itself, more remarkable than here and there a reed of
higher growth than common, or a plant of Foxglove, that by its gay
blossom seems to mock the desolate sadness of the spot. Another
turn, however, still following the wavy carvings of the mountain's
base, for mountain there it seems to he, opens another view, and one
that speaks to many senses at once, the difference between the mean-
holy caused by nature, and that produced by the work of man. A
wide spreading cotton-factory here rears its unsightly form, and at one
glance makes the happy wanderer whose foot is free to turn which
way he will, feel how precious is the power of retracing his steps back
again along the beguiling path that has led him to it.
This was a joy for which our little Michel sighed in vain. On
Pegged the cart, and nearer it came at every jolt to the object which
he most hated to look upon. But then came also the cheering thought,
that he was no longer a mere factory boy, but about to become an
apprentice to a good and profitable trade, in which hereafter he might
expect to get money enough for himself, for mother, and Teddy tool
Nevertheless, he certainly did with, at the very bottom of his heart,
that the stocking-weaving business was not carried on in a building
so very like a cotton factory1 Dut though Michael saw this hatch cotton
factory, he as yet saw but a small portion of the horrors which belonged
to the spot he had reached. His position in the vehicle made it impose-
bible for him to look round, and perceive how completely all the acts
that might be committed in that Deep alley, were hid from the eye
of every human being but those engaged in them. Neither could he
recognise in the dismal building detached, yet connected hoth with the
manager's house and the factory, the Prison Prentice-house which
served as one to hundreds of little aching hearts, each one endowed
by nature with light spirits, merry thoughts, and fond affections: but
all of whom rose to their daily toil under circumstances which rendered
enjoyment of any kind both morally and physically impossible.
The gradations by which all the misery that awaited him was is-
closed, were, however, neither lingering nor uncertain. The cart
stopped, Parsons got out, and then calling forward his companion,
seized him roughly by the arm, and swung him through the door which
opened to receive them.
 So This is the chap you are going to bestow upon us, is it,
Mr, Parsons ?'' said a fellow, whose aspect must have withered hope
in the gamest spirit that youth and joy ever produced between them.
 Has he nimble fingers?
He can move 'em quick enough when he've got a mind for it,''
replied Parsons.  But you must not spare the strap, I can tell you,
for a more obstinate hard-skinned little devil, never crossed the three-
hold of a factory.''
 Never mind, Mr. Parsons, we know how to manage all those
matters, you may depend upon it. We possess many advantages over
you, sir. No parents here you know, to come bothering us about


1I84

and that under most hard and unrelenting masters; but till now,
he had never known how very wretched his young thoughts could
make him. His mother's fond caresses, and his brother's fervent love,
had in spite of oil, and sometimes in spite of hunger, cheered and
comforted the last moments of every day. The rude bed also, on which
the brothers lay, was too clean, notwithstanding all the difficulty of
keeping it so, to be tainted with the loathsome scent of oil, or sundry
other abominations which rendered the place where he now lay, almost
intolerable. Yet to this den, far, far away from the only creatures
who loved and cherished him, he was come by his own consent, his
own express desire The thought was almost too bitter to bear, and
the bundle of straw that served him for a pillow, received for the first
hour of the night a ceaseless flood of tears.
It was, as his young companion had predicted, by the sound of a
flourished whip, that he was awakened on the following morning. In
an instant he was on his feet, and a minute or two more sufficed to
invest him in his clothes; this speed, however, was the effect of terror,
for he remembered not the invitation of the preceding evening. But
hardly had he finished the operation of dressing, when Charley Ford,
the boy who gave it, was by his side, and giving him a silent hint by
a win of the left eye, and a movement of the right elbow that he
might follow him, turned away, and ran down stairs.
Michael did so too, and presently found himself with a multitude of
others in a small paved court, on one side of which was a put, to
whose spout every child came in succession to perform a very necks-
vary, but, from lack of soap, a very imperfect act of solution.
Neglecting to watch his turn for this, and not permitting Michael
to do so either, Charles Ford made his way to a door that opened upon
another part of the premises, and pushing it open, disclosed to the eyes
of Michael a loathsome and a fearful spectacle.
Seven or eight boys had already made their way to the sort of rude
farm-yard upon which this door opened, one and all of whom were
intent upon prolonging from a filthy trough just replenished for the
morning meal of two stout hogs, a variety of morsels which, as
Michael's new acquaintance assured him, were `` dainty caring for the
starving prentice of Deep Valley mill''
 Make haste, young'un,'' cried Charles, good-naturedly, ``or they
won't leave a turnip-paring for us.'' And on he rushed to the scuffle,
leaving Michael gazing with disgust and horror at the contest between
the fierce snouts of the angry pigs, and the active fingers of the
wretched crew who contested with them for the offal thus cost forth.
Michael Armstrong was a child of deep feeling: and it was, per-
has, lucky for him, that the burning sense of shame and degradation
which pervaded every nerve of his little frame, as he looked on upon
this revolting spectacle, come upon him while yet too young for any
notion of resistance to suggest itself. He felt faint, sick, and broken-
hearted; but no worm that ever was crushed to attacks by the foot of
an elephant, dreamed less of vengeance than did poor Michel, as
the horrid thought came over him, that he was going to abide in a

not yet reached that shrunk and wasted condition which was nearly
general among her companions. Michael looked at her as she bent
over her threads, and repaired the incessant breaking among them
with her white little hands, with a degree of love and pity which
while it wrung his heart, softened the harl despair that had nearly
seized upon him, by making him feel, that though his mother and
his brother were lost to him for long long years, during which he was
to taste of nothing but misery, still there was somebody who might
grow to love him. This was a timely solace: Young as he was, he
perceived at once, that instead of being brought to Deep Valley to
learn a trade, he had been beguiled to enter there found and helpless,
for more years than he dared to count, and with no prospect of learn-
in any thing beyond the same slavish process of waiting upon the
machinery, which had painfully occupied his daily existence, and that
of his dearer brother, as long as they could remember to have lived.
Under these circumstances, it was truly a great blessing to have found
somebody of whom he might make a friend, and so strongly did the
for little fellow feel it, that when the miserable hand were led to
their morning meal, he told Fanny as he walked beside her, that he
thought he should grow to behave better than he had done that morn-
ing, if she would always talk to him about good things, and let him
talk about mother and Tell to her in return.
There's a good boy'' replied Fanny, soothinogly. `I will talk to
you, Michael, whenever I can-and never mind,'' she added, as they
sat down again side by side at the long dirty board that formed their
breakfast table, `` never mind not having whats good to eat, it won't
taste so nasty by and by, when you grow used to it.''
1 won't mind it'' replied Michael, manfully, as he supped tha
musty-flavored wary mess.  But I wish I had got a bit of good
bread for you, Fanny''

Du the whole of the day which followed Miss Brotherton's
expedition to oxley-lane, that young lady remained waiting at home,
not very patiently, for Sir Matthew Dowling's promised community-
tion. But still it came not, and when, at an hour too late to hope for
it any longer, she at length retired to bed, it was in a state of spirit-
tion and anxiety that left her little chance of quiet slumber.

R LIFE AND ADvVEMTUnES
my dear hoy, this delay cannot justify the look of misery it produces
on your couantenance. Tell me, Edward, what is it that you fear for
Michael I''
I do not know myself,'' replied the boy. `` And yet I think it
over in my head day and night only to find out what is the very worst
possible they can do to him.''
2 But is that wise, Edward, or is it right, think you, while your poor
mother has only you left to comfort her, that you should only strive to
fill your own head and her with the very worst thoughts your fancy can
conjure up 7'
I do not fill mother's head with them,'' replied Edward. ' I have
never told her one single word of all my dismal thoughts.''
ee Then you are a good boy, and 1i love you for it. But what are
your dismal thoughts, Edward? Yon may tell them to me.''
The boy hesitated for a moment, and then said-- 1 think Sir
Matthew Dowling is a wicked, cruel man: and I think that he would be
more likely to be wicked and cruel to Michael than good to him,''
 What is it has made you think Sir Matthew cruel and wicked, Ed-
ward ?'' demanded Miss Brotherton.
 Because he is hard and unjust to those who labour for him-and
because I have seen him laugh and make sport of the years of little
children.,''
There was something in the accents of the boy that startled MAry.-
She felt inclined to exclaim-- How much more older art thou than
the looks1' so thrilling was the one, and so profound the feeling with
which he spoke.
 Yet still,'' she replied, '` it is difficult to see that he could gain any
advantage by ill-using Michael in any way bal enough to make you
look so miserable, Edward,''
 If he keeps him from me is not that enough?'' sail the pale boy,
looking reprachfully at her.
 But, Edward, you knew that he was going to leave you: and your
mother, at least, consented to it,''
4 Yes, she did consent to it. Poor, dear mother 1 She did consent
to it. But had 1 been true, as I ought to have been, she never
would,'' said Edward, clasping his hands and closing his eyes with a
look of intense suffering.
 Explain yourself, my dear boy,'' said Mary, kindly.' In what
have you been otherwise than true t''
 We agreed together-poor Michael and me agreed together,need
to let mother know how bad we were served at the mill--and, above
all, we agreed that she should never know how miserable Michael was
at the great house, 'cause we was sure she'd have him away, and s0
lose the bit of comfortable food she has been having. BUt it was
wrong and wicked to deceive her. We should have told her all, and
then Michael would have never gone 1''
 You acted for the best, my dear boy, and must not reproach your-
self,'' replied Mary; ` and so far as I from thinking it wrong to keep
her mind easy in her present state of health, that I strongly advise her

being still comforted as much as possible by our manner of talking to
her. Fear not, Award, that I shall neglect the safety of Michael,
because you will not hear me talk of his being in any danger. I will
not rest till I know that has become of him.''
Mary said this in a tone that left no doubt of her sincerity; and it
was then for the first time that Edward seemed to remember her great-
ness. Ie stood up before her with a look of tender reverence interest-
silly touching, and said solemnly- Then God will bless you for it1''
And he will bless you, my dear child?'' replied Mary, with tears.
starting to her eyes.  He will bless and comfort you for all your
duty and affection. Keep up your spirits, Award, and, above all
things, never be idle. It is for your mother's sake as well as your own
that I am so anxious you should learn to read and write, dear Edward
--and by degrees we shall get you on to cheering, and who knows
but we may make a clerk or accountant of you, and so enable you to
get money, even if your health is not very good,''
The boy smiled languidly as he replied, `` I should like it very much,
if I was to live long enough.''
You will get stout and well, Edward,'' said Mary, cheerfully,
t' now that you have no hard work to do. And you shall come up to
the same school that all my boys and girls go to here-and when
school is over, you must come every day to my kitchen with a little
basket for your mother. You understand, Edward? And once every
week you must come up into this room to me with your books, that I.
may see your writing and hear you read a little.''
A gleam of he and joy kindled in the boy's beautiful eyes as he
listened to her, and a right blush mantle his pale cheeks; but it was
like the fitting sunshine of April chased by a heavy cloud almost be-
for its warmth could be felt or its beauty seen. e Of l if Michael
could but hear that '' he exclaimed, while teams, for the first since the
conversation began, burst from his eyes. ss That was what poor Mi-
chapel always wanted. If I could but learn, and to get my bread with-
out mill-slavery, Mike always said he would nothing working himself,
'cause he was so strong. But now that very thing is come; and he,
maybe, will never know it s''
Heavy and fast the drops fell from beneath the hand which he had.
raised to conceal his face, till Mary, as she watched him, wept for
company. This, however, was not the way to help him, and conquer-
in a weakness so every way unwise, she spoke to him with affectionate
but steady firmness of the exertion it was his duty to make at a time
when his mother had none but him to comfort her. She had touched
the right string--the little fellow's nerves seemed braced, and every
faculty awakened by the words she uttered; and if he took back to
his mother no timings of poor Michael, he brought to her support a
yong spirit strong in endurance, and an intellect that, for the first
time, had whispered to its owner hopes, promises, and aspirations,
which seemed to make the life he had often loathed a new-found trea-
sure to him. Mary saw not all that passed in the young mind she had
rescued from the listlass languor of despair, yet she perceived enough

 WYaellnow, my dear, I am sure I have no objection in the world to
tell you, and certainly one does pick up a vast deal of information
at such a party as that. Will you believe it? two of the Simmonses
are going to be married,''
Really1 That's very good news, I suppose. Had you a great
many people there2''
 Oh I Every body, just every body, but your on dear self; and
I can truly say that if you had been there, it would have been quite
perfect :''
You are very kind; but a person so very much afraid of taking
cold, is always troublesome on these al fresco occasions. Lady Clarissa
was there of course ''
Of course, my dear. And such a flirtation with Sir Matthew
God knows, I ain't over strict in any way; I despise it, because it
shows such ignorance of life and good society. But I must say, I do
think they carry the thing a little too far. Of course, a lady of rank
and title like Lady Clarissa, is not to be judged altogether like com-
mon people. I am quite aware of that, and nothing can be more
thoroughly vulgar than forgetting this. And I certainly have lived too
much in really first-rate good society, not to know it. But, reverted-
lee. you know, there is reason in roasting eggs, and even an early's
rights nay get talked of.'
Was Laid Dowling in presence?'' inquiry Mis Brotherton,
smiling.
:: No, my dear, thank God she was not, or we should have had sour
looks with our sweetheart, I can tell you.''
Did Sir Matthew bring his little favourite with him? The little
boy he has adopted you know 2''
 Oh2 dear, haven't you heard all that yet Well now, pen ny
word, Mary Brotherton, it will not do, your shutting yourself up in
this way. Catching cold, indeed1 As if I, the daughter of my own
poor dear father, wasn't likely to know more than Mrs. Teletext about
catching cold: Why, my dear, the little boy has been sent away I
don't know how long, with a monstrous premium, paid by Sir Matthew,
to get him entered at one of the first commercial houses in Europe.
Dr. Crockley was exceedingly agreeable and attentive to me all day
yesterday. And, indeed, so he was, I must say, to every body. We
do sometimes differ about spinal complaints, and I1 think he is a great
deal too speculative. But it is impossible to deny that he can be very
agreeable when he chooses it, and it was he that told me all about this
last noble act of Sir Matthew. To be sure he is an honour to the
country if ever there was one, fAir MAtthew, I mean. It is such men
as that, Miss DBrotherto, that brings wealth and prosperity to out
glorious country. To think only of the hands he employs Fifteen
hundred children taking all his mills together, he told us yesterday,
besides several women and men. Oh: it is glorious to be sure How-
ever, Dr. Crockley did just whisper to me, but I don't believe he
meant it should go much farther, he did certainly hint, that poor cross
Lady Dowling, did not like to have the little fellow in the house, and

THE LIFE AND ADVENTURES
that was one reason why good Sir Matthew was in such a hurry to
place him.''
Did you happen to her to what part of the country the boy had
been sent, Mrs. Gabberly ?''
WHy, not my dear, I can't say I did. But that makes no differ-
use you know. Every body is aware that it is a noble situation for
him, and that's the main point of course.''
OhIO1 certain. I only asked from idle curiosity. And I suppose.
Mrs. Gabherly, that it is because I am so idle, that I do often feel
curious about things that nobody else seems to care about. Do you
know I am dying to get into a factory, and see all these dear little
children at work. It must be so pretty to see them all looking so
proud and so happy, and all enjoying themselves s much. I really
must get a peep at it,'' said Miss Brotherton.
 Law. my dear1 What a very queer notion,'' replied Mrs. Gab-
berry.
 Perhaps it is,'' said Mary smiling, `` as nobody else in the whole
neighbourhood ever talks about it; but if I have such a fancy, there
can be no reason why I should not indulge i1, can there 2''
 WHy, good gracious, my dear child only think of the dirt1 You
would be downright poisoned, Mary.''
Poisoned? How can that be, dear Mrs, Gabberly, when every
body agrees that it is such a blessing to the country, to have brought
such multitudes of children to work together in these factories ?''
Nonsense, my dear'' replied Mrs. Gabberly, knitting her brows.
e This is some of Mrs, Teletext's vulgar ignorance, I am very sure.
How can a girl of your good understanding, Miss Brotherton, speak
as if what was good and proper for the working classes, had any thing
to do with such as you. Fie1 my dear1 Pray never let any body in
the neighbourhood hear you talk in this strange wild way, I do assure
you, that there is nothing that would do you so much injury in the
opinion of all the first families whereabouts. and nobody knows this
neighbourhood better than 1 do.''
I am quite aware of that Mrs. Gabberly,'' said the young lady
very respectfully, `` and that is one reason why I wish to talk to you
about this notion of mine. Is it really true, Mrs. Gabberly, that none
of the ladies in the neighbourhood ever go into the factories ?''
 To be sure it is. Why should they go, for goodness sake2''
Oh1 I don't know exactly.-bUt I cannot see why they should
not-if they wish it,'' replied Miss Brotherton, modestly.
 WEll now, but I do, my dear. And I do beg and entreat that
you won't talk any more about it. I am quite sure, Mary, that some-
body or other has been talking nonsense to you, about all this. If you
had got any friends or connexions towards Fairly now, I should think
they had been telling you all the romantic stuff that has been hatch-
in there about factory children, and God knows what beside. But I
don't believe you have eer gone visiting that way, have you, 
dear2'
And who is there at Fairly, dear Mrs. Gahberly, who would be
a MIChaEL ARMSTRONG.
197
likely to talk to me on such a subject?'' said MAry, colouring to the
temples, with eagerness to hear the answer.  Good gracious my
dear, did you never hear tell of that poor wrong-headed clergyman,
George HBeIl? Such a difference to be sure between one man and
another. My dear good Mr. Gabberly never in his life breathe a
word that could hurt the feelings of his neighbours. He visited then
every one, and was on the best and most friendly terms with them all,
which is that I call living in the true spirit of Christian charity.
Whereas this tiresome, troublesome, Mr. bEll, has taken it into his
head to find out wrong, where every body else sees nothing but right:
and God forbid, my dear, that you should take it into your dear innocent
heal to follow any of his mischievous fancies;: I wonder what he'll
get by it? Great goose he must be, to be sure, not to see that he is
going exactly the way to set every body that can be of the least use to
him smack against him in all things:''
WAlt is it he does, Mrs. Gaberly, that is so very wrong?'' de-
handed Miss Brotherton.
IYhat is it he does? Why just every thing he ought not to do,
my dear, that's all. You would hardly elite, perhaps, that a cler-
lyman should actually encourage the poor to complain of the very
labour by which they live And yet I give you my word and honour
that is exactly what he has been doing. It's incredible, isn't it, al-
most IIe positively says, loud enough for all the country to hear him,
that the labour in the factories-such a blessing as it is to the poor-
he actually says that it is bad for the children's health. Such stuff,
you know, my dear, as if the medical men did not know best; and
there's numbers of 'em that declare that it's quite impossible to tell in
any way satisfactory that it can do 'em any harm at all. And, upon my
word, l1 don't know what poor people will come to: It's quite out of
the question to attempt pleasing'em. If they've got to work they are
perfectly outrageous about that, and ready to tear people to pieces just
to get it: and no sooner is there enough to do, that away they go
bawvling again, swearing that the children are over-worked ; isn't it pro
voting my dear2''
 MIr. George Bell,'' said Mary, very distinctly.
 Yes, my dear, that's the name of the foolish man who seems to
take a pleasure in making people fancy they are not well enough of,
when 1'm sure, by all I can hear and understand, these very identical
people may consider themselves first and foremost of the whole world
for prosperity,'' replied Mrs. Gabberly.
Fairly 7'' rejoined MIss Brotherton, interrogatively,
Yes, my dear, Fairly's where he lives, if I don't mistake.''
Good morning, Mrs. Gabberly,'' said the young lady, rising some-
what abruptly;  I am very glad you had such a pleisantdlay yesterday.
Good bye.'' And without permitting the stream of Mrs. Amberley's
eloquence ta well forth upon her afresh, the heiress slipped through
the parlour door, and escaped.

EvnTLESs PoOR LASTLY.
To order the carriage. and to give Mrs. Teletext notice that she
wished her to make all speed in preparing to accompany her in it, was
to Miss HBrotherton the work of a moment. As the business she was
on might, however, take some hours, she urged her old friend to eat
luncheon as if certain of having no dinner: and having given time for
this, and interrogated her coaching concerning distance and so forth,
the hopeful, animated girl, sprung into her carriage as the clock struck
two, determined not to re-enter her mansion till she had lost some or-
tion of the ignorance which had of late so cruelly tormented her.
The roads were good, and by the help of a short bait, Miss Brother-
ton and her companion reached Fairly turnpike a lille after four.
Here she made inquiries for the residence of MIr. Bell, and having
learned in what direction she should find it, repeated the instructions
to her coaching, and made him drive on.
``Are the horses to be put up there, ma'am 2'' demanded the coach-
man.
:Yes-no, James, not there I suppose-that is, not at the clergy-
man's house; but of course you will be able to find some place quite
near, you know; and WIlliam must wait-no, not wait, but come back
as soon as he knows where you put up, that l may send for you when I
am ready.''
To these, not over-clear, instructions James answered  Yes ma'am,''
and drove off.
In obedience to the directions received at the toolbar, the carriage
soon left the high-road, and proceeded down a grassy lane, which
harvest carts for the time had rolled into smoothmness. Less than a
quarter of a mile of this, brought the wanderers to another turning,
that in five minutes placed them before the gates of an edifice the
aspect of which made Mary pull the check-string.
That looks like a parsonage-housel Does it not?'' said Miss
Bratherton.
And before MIrs. Teletext could answer,WIlliam had already opened
the door, and let down the steps. It was very easy to get out, and
very easy to inquire if Mr. Bell were at home; but when answered in
the affirmative, Miss Brotherton feltthat it was not very easy to decide
in what manner to explain the cause of her visit to the object of it.
She had by no means settled this point to her satisfaction, when the
door of a small parlour, lined with books, was opened to her, and she
found herself in the presence of the gentleman she had so ceremony-
anxious come to visit.
o MICHAEL ARISrRONO.
199
There was much in the countenance of Mr. Bell to reassure a more
timid spirit than that of Mary Brotherton; nevertheless she stood be-
for him for a minute or two in some embarrassment, not so much from
fear of him, as of herself. Did she fail to make him at once under-
stand the movie of her inquiries, he could not avoid thinking both
them and herself pertinent, and this consciousness caused a much
brighter glow than usual to mantle her cheeks, as she stood before
him, with her eyes fixed timely, and almost beseechiagly, on his
face.
Although iss Drotherton had not quite the easy and (tant soit
deal assured air of a woman of fashion, there was enough in her
appearance to indicate her claim to observance, as well as admiration,
and Mr. Bell opened the conversation by earnestly requesting that she
would sit down.
His aspect hadl done much towards giving her courage, and his
voice did more.
 You are very kind sir,'' sail she, `to receive so courteously a
stranger, who has in truth no excuse whatever to offer for thus intrud-
ing on you. Nevertheless, I am greatly tempted to hope, that if 1
can succeed in making you understand the object of my visit, you will
forgive the freedom of it.''
 And I,'' returned Mr. Bell, smiling, ` am greatly tempted to be-
lieve that let the object of this visit be what it may, lI must always feel
grateful toit. Is there any thing, my ear young lady, that I can do to
serve you 2''
t here is indeed, Mr. Bell I'' she replied, with great earnestness of
voice and manner. `I am come to you for instruction. Though you
do not know me, you probably may know the place at which I live.
My name is Mary bBrotherton, and my house is called MilFord Park,''
Certainly, Miss Brother, hoth your name, and that of your
residence are known to me-on what subject can t give you any in-
formation that may be useful ?''
 Circumstances, Mr. Bell, have lately directed my attention to a
subject which my own situation in life, as well as the neighbourhood in
which I live ought to have long ago made thoroughly familiar to me-
such is not the case, however; I am profoundly, and 1 fear shamefully
ignorant respecting the large and very important class of our popular-
tion employed in the factories. I am in possession of a large fortune
wholly amassed from the profits obtained by my father from this species
of labour, and I cannot but feel great interest in the welfare and pro-
security of the people employed in it-especially as i understand a very
large proportion of them are young children-and moreover, that
from some cause or other, which I can by no means understand, the
whole class of' the factory people,' as I hear them called, are spoken
of with less kindness and respect by those who had grown rich upon
their industry, than any other description of human beings whatever.
I am told, sir, that it would be unsafe, improper, and altogether rong
were l to attempt making myself personally acquainted with them, as
I would wish to do-and having accidentally, Mr. Bell, heard your
200
TE LIRE AND ADVEnTURES
name mentioned as a person who took an interest in their concerns, I
have come to you thus unceremonionsly, in the hope that you would
have the kindness to give me more accurate information on the subject,
than I have found it possible to obtain elsewhere.''
Mr, Bell, who had placed himself immediately opposite to her, looked
in her young face, and listened to her earnest voice as she spoke, with
the deepest attention. It soon became sufficiently clear that he can-
sidered not this intrusion as requiring apology, but that on the con-
tracy his very heart and soul were moved by her words. Hc paused
for a moment after she had ceased speaking, as if unwilling to inter-
rust her by his reply; but when he found that she remained silent, he
said,
 The subject on which you are come to converse with me, my dear
MIss IBrotherton, is assredly the very last I should have expected to
hear named by a young lady in your position-for it is one from which
the rich and great of our district turn away with loathing and contempt.
Yet is it the one of all others to which I would if possible direct their
best attention, involving as it does both their interest and their duty be-
bond any other. But I fear I cannot enter upon it without wounding
many prejudices which of necessity you must have imbibed, and pro-
in to you that much which doubtless you have been educated to con-
sider right, is on the contrary most lamentably wrong. Can you bear
this my dear young lady 3'
 I hope I could, in a search alter truth, Mr. Bell, even if my mind
were in the condition you suppose,'' replied Mary.  But this is not
the case. you will not have to remove many false impressions I think.
-It is the total absence of all knowledge on the subject, which I am
bold enough to ask you to remedy.'
 And most willingly will I endeavour to do so, to the very best of
my ability,'' replied MIr. Bell.-: But to me it is a beguiling subject,
and if I detain you too long, you must tell me so.''
 Fear not,'' replied MAry, smiling. :: I shall be more willing to
hear, than you to speak.''
t You are of course aware, MIss Brotherton,'' resumed the clergy-
man, ` that the large proportion of young labourers to whom you have
just alluded, are calculated to amount, in Yorkshire and lancashire
alone to upwards of two hundred thousand.''
Is it possible ?' exclaimed Mary,  Alas1 Mr. Bell you must not
think that' of course' I know any thing-had you named two thousand
as the number, my surprise would have been less.''
 But so it is, Miss Brotherton. Above two hundred thousand young
creatures, including infants among them, counting only five years of
life, are thus employed in the counties I have named; and they surely
form a class, which both from their numbers, and their helplessness are
entitled to English sympathy and protection ?''
 Unquestionably'' cried Mary, eagerly,  I always feel that the
labouring poor hae great and nnceasing claims upon the sympathy
and assistance of the rich.-But this claim must be equally great l
o MICHAEL ARMStRONG.
201
should suppose amongst all the labouring classes. Is it not, Mr.
Be:
:I feel it difficult to answer your question by a negative,'' he re-
plied, `` because, taken in its broadest sense, it most assuredly demands
an affirmative. Nevertheless it is unquestionably true that at this
moment there is no race of human beings in any portion of the known
world-the most wretched of negro slaves not excepted, Miss BRother-
to-who require the protection and assistance of their happier fellow-
creatures, in the same degree as the young creature employed in our
factories,''
Miss Brotherton looked at him, not doubtingly, but with consider-
able surprise, and timely replied, `: But the negro slave, Mlr. Bell, has
no choice left him-he is the property of his master,''
 Neither has the factory child a choice, Miss Brotherton. He to
is a property; nor is it the least horrible part of the evil which noise-
lessly has grown out of this tremendous system, that the beings whom
nature has ordained throughout creation to keep watch and ward over
the helpless weakness of infant life, are driven by it to struggle with,
and trample down the holiest and dearest of human ties-even the love
of a parent for its offering. Picture to yourself a bleak winter's morn-
ing, Miss Brotherton, when the mother of factory children must be up
hours and hours before the sun to rouse her half-rested little ones:; and
nervously watching her rude clock till the dreaded moment comes, mst
shake the title creatures, whose slumber the very best of the field
might teach her to watch over and guard, till they awake, and starting
in terror from their short sleep, ask if the hour be come? Thc wretched
mother, and the wretched child then vie with each other in their term-
bling haste to seize the tattered mill-clothes, and to put them on. The
mother dreads the fine of one quarter of the infant's daily wages, which
would be levied, should it arrive but a minute too late, and the poor
child dreads the strap, which, in addition, is as surely the punishment
for delay. Miss Brotherton, I hae seon with my own eyes the as-
selling of some hundreds of factory children before the still unopened
doors of their prison-house, while the lingering darkness of a winter's
night had yet to last three hours. I shall never forget one bitter morn-
ing, last January twelvemonthl The last pirates summons from
dying parishioner had left me no choice but to exchange my pillow for
the bitter biting blast of Howley- common, and the path across it lead-
in me within a hundred yards of a large cotton-factory, I witnessed a
spectacle, which to my dying day I shall never recall without a shed-
der: There was just moon enough to show me all the dreary sternness
of the scene.-The ground was covered deep with snow, and a cutting
wind blew whistling through the long line of old Scotch firs which
bordered an enclosure beside therapy. As I studded on beneath them,
my eye caught the little figures of a multitude of children, made dis-
strictly visible, even by that dim light, by the strong relief in which their
dark garments showed themselves against the snow. A few steps
further brought me in full view of the factory gates, and then I per-
received considerably above two hundred of these miserable little victims

rE LIFE AND ADYxURES
together under the potent inspiration of the overlooked's strap. Then
comes a state of deeper degradation still. The father is idle, for often
he can get to work, and it is to the labour of his little ones that he
looks for bread. Nature recoils from the spectacle of their unnatural
o'elaborated aspect as they return from their thirteen, fourteen, if-
teen, hours of toil. He has not nerve to look upon it, and creeps to
the gin-shops till they are hid in bed. The mother sees it all, and
sternly screws her courage to the task of lifting their bruised and
weary limbs upon their bed of straw, putting into their mouths the food
she has prepared, their weary eyes being already closed in sleep, and
preparing herself to wake before the sun on the morrow, that with un-
relenting hand she may drag them from their unfinished slumber, and
drive them forth again to get her food. This is no varnished tale, MIss
Brotherton, but the bare, naked, hideous truth. And can you wonder
that beings thus reared and ripened should form a degraded class
Can you wonder that all others should turn from them, as from a race
with whom they have nothing in common? If some sad accident,
preceding birth, disturbs the beautiful process by which nature prepares
the noble being she has made to be lord of all, and an abortive crea-
ture comes to life, curtailed of all its fair proportions, both of mind
and body, all within reach of the hapless prodigy shudder as they
mourn, and the best and wisest among them pray to God that its span
of life be short. bUt believe me when I tell you, MIss bBrotherton,
that the effect which the factories of this district is producing upon
above two hundred thousand of its population, is beyond all calcula-
tion more deplorable, and many a child is born amongst them whose
destiny, if fairly weighed against that of such one as l have described,
would appear incomparably more terrible.''
Can such things be, and the rulers of the land sit idly by to wit-
ness it?'' cried Mary shuddering.
It seems as if the rulers of' the land knew little, and cared less
about it,'' replied MIr. Bell.  The profoundly ignorant opinion that
there is some connexion between our national prosperity, and the
enormous fortunes amassed by some score of North-country manual-
tubers has, I believe, produced much of the lamentable non-interfere-
ence of which the disinterested few complain, who are near enough
to look upon the frightful game. Some individual voices have been
most gloriously raised on this tremendous theme, and if they will
be steadfast and enduring, they must and will prevail-for human na-
ture, with all its vices, is not framed to look coldly on sch horrors,
and permit them. But the remedial process is so slow-it is so diff-
cult to arouse the attention, and awaken the feelings of busy men con-
corning things at a distance, whose connexion with all that they deem
important they are too ignorant of, or too preoccupied to trace, that the
deepest observers, and those who would the most deeply deprecated any
remedy but a legal one, begin to fear that mercy will be clamoured for
with very dangerous ruleness, before the parliament of England shall
have roused up its wisdom to the task of affording it.
:And in what way, Mr. Bell, is it wished, or hoped, that the legis-

nature should step forward to cure this dreadful evil? Is it proposed
to abolish the use of machinery t''
Mr, Bell smiled, and shook his head.
You perhaps think,'' said he, `` that there is a great disproportion
between my strong sense of the vice and suffering produced by the
factory system, and the measure for its mitigation to which I now limit
almost my wishes. But it would be vain to look back to the time when
steam engines were not, and there would indeed be little wisdom in
addressing our lamentations to their introduction. It is not the acqui-
sition of any natural power, principle, or faculty, that we should be-
lore; all such, on the contrary, should be hailed as part and parcel
of our magnificent birthright, and each new use we learn to make of
the still much-unknown creation around us, ought to be welcomed with
a shout of praise, as a fresh fulfilment of the supreme command
' replenish the earth and subdue it' It is not from increased, or in-
creasing science that we have any thing to read, it is only from a
fearfully culpable neglect of the moral power that should rule and re-
gulate its uses, that it can be other than one of God's best gifts.''
But how,'' demanded Mary, `` how, if machinery continues to be
used, can any Act of Parliament prevent the necessity of employing
children to wait upon its operations instead of requiring the strength
of' men, as heretofore, to perform what the steam-engine does in their
place ?''
 No Act of Parliament can be conceived capable of inducing a
manufacturer to employ the weaker, and at the same time the more
costly agent, in preference to a more powerful and cheap one,'' re-
plied MIr. Bell. ` No reasonable man would ask this, no rea-
soluble man would desiro it, and assuredly no reasonable man
would attempt to enforce such an absurdity by law. No, Miss Bro-
theron, this mighty power, as surely given for our use as is the
innocent air that fans the woodbine yonder, has at length, after
some few thousand years of careless overlooking on our part been
revealed to us. But let us not fly in the face of indignant nature,
and say like Caliban,
 You taught me langage ; and my profit on'it
Is, I know how to curse'
If used right the cannot be a doubt that this magnificent power
might, in all its agencies, be made the friend of man. Ite requires no
great stretch of ingenuity to conceive that it might be rendered at once
a source of still increasing wealth to the capitalist, and o lightened
labour to the not-impoverished operative. But that, as things are at
present, this great discovery, and all the admirable ingenuity with
which it is applied, acts as a ban instead of a blessing upon some
hundred thousands of miserable victims is most true, while all the benefit
that can be shown as a balance to this horror, is the bloated wealth of
a small knot of master-manufacturers. But so monstrous is this evil,
that its very atrocity inspires hope, from the improbability that when
once beyond all reach ol contradiction its existence shall be known
by all men, it should be permitted to continue.''

of the ordinary modes of being useful on a larger scale, such as
organising schools, founding benefit societies, or the like, could be of
any use to beings sa crushed, so toil-worn, and so degraded, it would
be idle to hope.''
Miss Brotherton now rose to depart-but as the extended her hand,
and began to utter her farewell, it occurred to her that it was possible
her new friend might, by conjecture at least throw some light upon the
destination of little Michael, and avoiding as much as possible the
making any direct charge against her rich neighbour, she briefly nar-
rated the facts of Michael's adoption, dismissal, and unknown desti-
nation, with little commentary on either, but concluded by saying,
The mother of the child is in great anxiety about him, and though
lI cannot conceive it possible any harm can have befallen the boy, i am
in some sort a fellow-sufferer with her in the anxiety which this
mystery occasions, from having almost pledged myself to learn the
place of his destination. Can you, dear sir, suggest to me any means
by which this information can be obtained?''
 Some part of this history has reached us already,'' replied Mr.
Bell. `` It has been somewhat industriously bruised through the neigh-
boyhood, that Sir Matthew Dowling, notoriously one of the most
tyrannical millocrats in the whole district, has been moved to kindness
in behalf of some poor widow's son, and taken him to be reared and
educated with his own children-s trust I am excusable, knowing what
I know, for misdoubting the disinterested benevolence of any act of
Sir Matthew Dowling's. Nevertheless it is certainly not easy to pec-e
clive why, after having so ostentatiously distinguished the boy, he should
kidnap him, as it were, from his own house, in order to get rid of him.
If, instead of being the object of especial four, the little fellow had
fallen under the rich knight's displeasure, Miss IBrotherton, I should
think it by a means improbable that he might have consigned him as
an apprentice to some establishment, too notorious for its severity to
make it desirable that his selection of it should be made known. But
of this there seems neither proof nor likelihood,''
Miss Brotherton turned pale as she listened to this suggestion.
Nay, but there is both truth and likelihood in such a suspicion,'' she
exclaimed with considerable emotion, and after a moment's consider-
tion, added, ` I know no reason why i should conceal the cause I have
for saying s-if you know not all, how can you give me counsel2''
Iiurriedly, and as briefly as possible, Miss Drotherton then recounted
the scene she had witnessed in the green-room of the Dowling-
lodge theatrical, but there was an unconscious and involuntary fer-
voir in her manner of narrating it, which rendered it impossible to listen
with indifference, or not to feel at the recital some portion of the in-
inflation she had felt when it occurred.
 It must be looked to, Miss Brotherton,'' replied her warm-hearted
new acquaintance.  he boy must be traced, tracked, found, and
rescued. I think there are few of these wretched prison-houses of
whose existence I am ignorant, and it is probable l may be able to
help you in this. Should I obtain any hint likely to be useful in the

bad ones in his commercial enterprises. The high-minded owners of
yonder factory releasing thousands every year by their efforts to purify
this traffic of its minorities-and some thousand small still voices call
down blessings on them for it. But while it costs them ten shillings
to produce what their neighbours can bring into the market for nine,
they will only he pointed at as pitiably unwise in their generation by all
the great family of Mammon which surrounds them. Few, alas1 will
think of following the example. All they can do therefore is in fact
but to carry on a system of private charity on an enormous scale-but
till they are supported by law, even their vast efforts, and most noble
sacrifices can do nothing towards the general redemption of our poor
northern people from the state of slavery into which they have fallen.
And yet I do believe, Miss Brotherton,'' he continued, after a pause,
1I do most truly believe that these greedy tyrants would fail more
rarely than now they do in their efforts to realize enormous wealth, of
the system were to undergo exactly the change we ask for. The plan
of under-selling may indeed in some few instances enable a very lucky
man to run up a blood-stained fortune: and blood-stained it must be,
for whenever this method of commanding a sale is pursued, and ruin
does NoT ensure, it is demonstrable that the bones and marrow of child-
aren, working unlimited hours, must have been the main agent in the
operation. But it is quite certain that the underselling system mst
upon the long run be ruinous. If all the losses upon our production
were fairly set against all the gains from the immoderate working. of
young hands, the slavery scheme would appear as little profitable as
holy. But here is your carriage, my dear young lady : God bless you:
and may we live to rejoice together over an ineffectual legislative remedy
for the evils we have passed this our first interview in deploying l''
So saying, he extended his hand to assist her into the carriage which
had already drawn up beside them-but Miss Brotherton stepped aside
while he performed this office to her friend, and then laying her hand
on his arm, drew him back a step or two to the spot from whence the
factory chimneys he had pointed out to her were visible.
 Tell me, before we part,'' she said, ' the names of those to whom
that building belongs?''
 WooD x Won,'' replied the clergyman.
 Thank you'' he replied; `` I shall never hear those names with-
out breathing a blessing on them''
Friendly farewells ware once more exchanged, and the meditative
heiress was driven back to Milford-park in silence so profound, that
her old friend believed her to be asleep, and carefully abstained from
any movement that might awaken her. But Mary Brotherton was not
asleep.

RELIC1O-s FALLIILITY IIE PU1 To TIME TEST.
ThE moment at which Michael Armstrong entered the cotton mill
at Deep Valley, was a criticalone. The summer had been more than
commonly sultry, and a large order had kept all hands very sharply at
work. Even at dead of night the machinery was never stopped, and
when one set of fainting children were dragged from the mules another
set were dragged from the reeking beds they were about to occupy, in
order to take their places. Theventilation throughout the whole fabric
was exceedingly imperfect; the heat, particularly in the rooms im-
mediately beneath the rool, frightfully intense: cleanliness as to the
beds, the floors, and the walls, utterly neglected: and even the persons
of the children permitted to be filthy to excess, from having no soap
allowed to assist their ablutions-though from the greasy nature of their
employment it was peculiarly required, while the coarse meal oc-
occasionally given out to supply its place wasinvariably swallowed, being
far too precious in the eyes of the hungry children to be applied to the
purpose for which it wasdesigned. In addition to all this, the food was
miserably scanty, and of a nature so totally unfit to sustain the strength
of growing children thus severely worked, that within a fortnight after
MIchael's arrival, an epidemic fever of a very alarming description be-
an to show itself., But it had made considerable progress, before the
presence of this new horror was revealed to him.
Notwithstanding all the hardships of Rockford factory, no infer-
titus disease had ever appeared there, which it is possible might have
been owing to the fact that the majority of the labourers in it lived at a
considerable distance, thus insuring to them a walk morning and might,
through the fresh air. This, though it added to their daily fatigue.
probably lessened the danger of it, while the wretched novels to which
they returned for their short night's rest, miserable shelters as they
were, reeled not with the congregated effluia of fifty uncleansed
sleepers in one cramer1 MIchael, therefore, had never before wit-
nested the hideous approach of contagion. The general appearance
to of the Deep Valley troop was so far from healthy, that the sickly
aspect of those first seized upon was less remarkable than it would.
have seen elsewhere. Thus another week wore away, during which,
though several of those who had been working when it began were
withdrawn, and known to be in the sick-ward ere it closed, the fact
that an infectious fever was among them had not yet got wing.
 Poor dear Betsy Price:'' whispered Fanny Fletcher to her friend
MIchael, as they sat side by side at their miserable dinner one day.
l heard misses tell master that she was dead. bUt I am trying to be
glad for t michael.''
Glued, Fanny%'' replied the boy, ``you told me once that you

liked her more than any other girl in the mill, and now you are glad
she is dead '
I am not so glad as I think I ought to be,'' returned Fanny
gently. ` She will not be hungry in Heaven, Michael, nor will she
work till she really to fall: and surely God will give us green fields
and sweet fresh air in Heaven, and there must be flowers, Michael.
Oh1 I am quite sure of that, and Betsy Price will have it all1 Ought
I not to be very, very, glad2'
michael looked in her sweet, innocent face, as she said this, and
tears filled his eyes.
An if you die, Fanny, must I be glad too 3'
If you thought about Heaven as 1 do, and if you loved me very
much indeed,'' replied the little girl, `1 can't tell how you could help
being glad.''
ButI do love you very much indeed,'' said Michael, almost choked
by his efforts not to cry, ``and I do think of Heave, too, Fanny, but
I could'not be glad if you was to die:''
Not when you hear that, Michael I'' said Fanny, starting up as the
last of the governor's whip resounded through the room as a signal
that their numbered moments of rest were over.  I suppose then I
love you better than yougov me, for. I could not help being goal if I
knew that you would never hear nor feel that lash again 1''
When they met again at supper, Michael, though still suspicious
of the cause, missed three more children from their places. He fan-
tied, too, that there was something new and strange in the aspect of
their hard-featured female tyrant; she was paler than usual, scolded
not at all, and when she spoke to her husband, it was in a voice that
hardly exceeded a whisper. Yet, notwithstanding this, some young
ears again caught words that told of death. Yet still the mill worked
n, and nothing seemed to mark that any calamity more than usual
had got among them.
y degrees, however, the growing pestilence burst forth, as it were,
before the eyes of the terrified children, and they knew that the grave
yawned before them all. Then it was that the ghastly countenances of
each doomed victim struck dismay into the hearts of their companions
even before they were permitted to leave their labour, and sink down
to the rest that should he disturbed no more. But still the mill went
on, for Mr. Llgood Sharpton hal just received a glorious order from
Russia, and it would have been perfect madness, as this gentlemen was
heard to remark to his eldest son, of a death or two among the apple-
tice children was to check the mill at such a time as that.
So the mill went on, and death went on too. But as it is considered
by all parties concerned to be extremely important that the cry of
epidemic contagion should not be raised in the neighbourhood of a
factory under these circumstances, it was deemed best by Mr. Elwood
Sharpton, and his confidential managers, not to call in medical assist-
ance.
For first and foremost, Poulet,'' said the experienced proprietor to
the governor of the apprentice house, `` first and foremost, it is of

THE LIFE AND ADVENTURE8
only one or two such thoughtful, meditative little things, as Fanny
Fletcher, who had began to remember having heard of infectious
fevers, and to think that maybe it was something of that sort that had
made Nos. 9, 16, 18, 19. &c., &c., stay away so long, and that too,
when the mill was so very busy.
bUt when it became generally known that the awful strength of MIrs.
Poulet was laid low, and when the words, `` the fever have clutched
her1'' had once been pronounced aloud, the palpable image of the pale
tyrant seemed to stand frowning in the midst of them, substituting his
grisly hour-glass and scythe for the first, and the frown he had con-
queued.
The scene which followed this was very frightful.-Those upon whom
infection had seized, sunk from their work at once, despite the goading
thong which had hitherto kept them from dropping-as the spur and
the last sustain the failing post-horse. While those who were yet un-
touched looked in each other's faces as if to watch who next should
fall. When the children from all the different floors of the fabric met
together at their midday meal, the first thought of each seemed to be
the finding out who was missing since last they assembled, and the
shuder that followed the perceiving another and another, and another
gone, ran along the shortening lines with an agony which grew more and
more intense as their numbers lessened.
When things had reached this state, Mr. Elwood Sharpton agreed
with Mr. Poulet that it might perhaps be as well to let an apothecary
from Tugswell visit the factory, to which reluctant decision two reasons
strongly contributed. The first was, that though with his usual fore-
thought he had divided his nocturnal burying between the churchyards
of Tugswell and Eddington, the clergymen of both had declared that
their frequency rendered it necessary that some inquiry should be made
into the cause of so great a mortality-and the second was that the
fact of the mistress of the apprentice house, being herself at the point
of death from the same malady, must infallibly prove to the medical
visiting that it was no treatment peculiar to the children which he oc-
occasion it, but that it had come beyond all possibility of contradiction
by the visitation of Gol.
Nevertheless the medical gentleman ventured to declare that nothing
would be so likely to stop the contagion as nourishing food; upon
which the terrified manufacturer astonished all the butchers within his
reach, by commanding a large supply of beef and mutton ``good
enough to make wholesome soup,'' and before another ghastly week had
passed away, the wisdom of this prescription became so evident that
when settling accounts together at the end of it, MIr. Poulet hinted to
his employer that he did not feel quite sure whether upon the whole a
little better living for the apprentices might not pay.
For all answer Mr. Elwood Sharpton pu his finger to the sum total
for provisions during the last week, and then turning back a page or
two of the huge volume, did the same by the sum total of a former
week.
 True, sir, true enough,'' said Mr. Poulet, ` but whomsoever it
o SOCIAL ARI9TONG.
217
can't be denied, that if we go on this fashion we shall have no hands
left to work with-and there would be but small profit in that sir.''
My dear Poulet, you do not study the population returns as at-
entirely as I do,'' replied his enlightened master.  Just at this
mOment it may be very right to cram them for several reasons-the
best being, observe, that by so doing we stop more mouths than their
own. But as to going on in the same style of expense when this fit of
dying and gossiping is over, it is quite out of the question, and I do
bcg that you will never mention the subject to me again. You can
know little my good Poulet of the rate at which paupcr children are
multiplied, if you think it necessary to preserve them at this ruinous
rate of expense. If there were all of them to die off before the end of
the month, l would undertake to have their place supplied before the
end of the next. You may take my word for it that no man ever suc-
needed in business who did not know how to take out an accurate
balance between profit and loss. I know to a fraction what each of
these 'prentice brats are worth, Poulet, and I can tell you that such
weekly bills as these would spcedily turn the tables against us.''
 In that case, sir,' there is surely no or to be said,'' replied
Poulet: and then changing the subject, he added, '` In course, sir,
you won't object to my misses being buried by day, instead of by night :
Besides respect to her, sir, I think it would be quite as well, showing
all the country, you see, as how flesh is but grass for the high, as for
the low, and making it manifest to all the country that it can't be no
want of good nursing and comfort as causes the deaths at our mill,''
 Quite right, quite right, Poulet,'' replied the rapid-minded Mr.
Sharpton, promptly; ` I would not object even to stopping the mills
for a couple of hours or so, and making all the hands follow as
mourners, iI you thought it would answer.''
 WHy, as to that, sir,'' said the faithful servant, ` I would not un-
undertake to say that we should be able to get up much of a procession
if we turned out the whole lot to choose from. They couldn't stand l
should think, sir, without the mules to hold by, for so long together.
They potter frightful, I can tell you, when they starts first to move to
and from, from factory to 'prentice-house, and back again, and I don't
think there would be either credit or profit in making a show of them.''
 Well, well1 do as you will, Ponlet. I dont care a brass farthing
whether they walk or stand; and I can't say when I built this factory,
it was with any view to make a show, as you call it, of the young
ladies and gentlemen to be employed in it''
With a light laugh which challenged an answering laugh from
the governor, widower as he was, Mr. Elwood Sharpton rose to depart.
Poulet attended him to the outer gate, and held his stirrup while he
amount, reiterating his promises to do the bEst he could, and only
stipulating for plenty of vinegar, and leaves to use soap till the cold
weather came in.
Meanwhile, though a less proportion iliei of those who were seized
with the malady, than before the improvement in the diet was intro-
ducey, the plague was as yet very far from being stayed. No day

oP MICHAEL ARMSTRONG.
21I9
It was an established custom among those who alone could give infor-
nation on the subject, never to permit any questioning concerning the
sick, or if they were boldly awarded, to give no other reply than a re-
buke. So that day after day, and week after week elapsed, without her
being at all able to guess, whether Michael were dead or alive. By de-
green, however, all hope of seeing him return, faded from her mind, and
the, poor little girl, she found out that people can't always wish
truly and really for what they know to be best either for themselves or
others. And day by day, though still the fever touched her not, she
grew more pale, more than, more melancholy. Now and then, indeed,
it still occurred to her as possible that Michael might reappear again, as
many had done after many days of sickness; but, alas: none had eer
staid away so long as he had done She had questioned many who
had been ill concerning him, but none seemed to know or care any
thing about those who had shared the sick chamber with them; till at
length, a boy to whom she had often addressed these questions, be-
cause she happened to know that he had been taken to the sick ward
on the same day as Michael, replied as if by a sudden effort of rebol-
election,
Of  that chap? hIm what was one of the last as come? Ay, ay, I
mind all about him. He was dead and buried before he had been
down three days.''
Fanny Fletcher asked no more questions, nor ha she any longer
hope of following where so many of her happier companions were gone.
The fever was pronounced to be over, the Factory and Apprentice-
house were whitewashed, and a number of new inmates arrived. AI]
things in short at the Deep-Valley Mills appeared to be going on as
presperously as usual; a statement which could be hardly impeached
by the fact that one little girl there was growing paler and more sha-
dow-like every day.

a sheet-your eyes are sunk in your head-when I look at you, instead
of the smiles you used to give me, I get nothing but sighs, and all for
what  Can you in honesty and truth say that you have gained any
thing worth knowing by following your own option instead of mine?
WHat good in the world can you do, dear, by listening to all the
shocking stories that clergyman there told ou? I dare say he is a very
good man, and he looks like it, but upon my word I think he is doing
nothing but just wasting his time, as well as yourself; for though 1 sat
and said nothing, as of course it was my place to do, I listened to
every word, and it is just because I believe every word was true, that
common sense makes me see there's no good to talk about it. In-
need, and indeed, my darling, J would not make free to talk to you in
this way, which looks for all the world as if I was taking advantage of
for goodness to me, if I did not see that you was going the way to
torment yourself for everlasting, without doing one bit of good to any
one. For how, my dear, can you, or that good clergyman either, hope
to put down all the wicked doings he toldabout ? And to be sure he
said as much himself-didn't he Miss Mar? Then to make up your
mind to be quiet and happy, and let things that you can't mend, alone.
Put as many children to school as you like, my year, and you may
give them a prettyneat uniform, you know, and that will be a pleasure
for you to think about, and to look at; but for pity's sake my dear,
dear, child1 give up at once, and for ever, this bothoring yourself for
everlasting about the factories, which you can no more stop, Mary,
than you can stop the sun from rising in the morning, and setting at
night.'
Here the good woman ceased, and looked with some anxiety in the
thoughtful eyes of her young mistress. She felt that she did not un-
understand their expression, and no wonder, for MAry IBrotherton her-
self sat silently doubting how she should answer her. A languid
tceling, proceeding partly from fatigue and disposition, and partly
from the discouraging conviction that she had no very satisfactory ar-
argument by which to rebut her old friend's charge of useless devotion
to a hopeless cause, made her for some minutes unwilling to speak at
all. Then came a somewhat peevish wish to interdict for ever the
discussion of the subject between them; but as she raised her eyes to
utter it, she encountered a look of such humble love, deprecating her
displeasure, yet fondly clinging to the freedom which risked the incur-
in it, that her purpose suddenly changed, and instead of the chilling
command she was meditating, she threw her arms round the old
woman's neck, exclaiming,
oH ? my dear nursel  IIow much, how very much you must loe
mel since care for my already too-much-cared-for peace and quiet,
can harden such a heart as yours towards all the sufferings we have
this day heard recounted''
Thank God you are not angry,'' cried the affectionate old woman
kissing her, and then arranging the neglected winglets of her pretty
charge, and looking cheerily in her face, she said, ` Now then, mAry,

I won't tease you any more about it. You are so sweet and so gentle
to me, that i am quite sure you will not long think my heart is hard;:
and then by degrees you will find out that i am right; and then all
will go well again, and 1 shall see my dear girl look like herself once
mare.''
` Nurse Tremlettl the time is already come when the impossibility of
my efforts being of any avail to stem the torrent with which avarice and
cruelty are overwhelming the land, is made evident to me. So much,
dear nurse, I concede to you, and therefore on that point we will argue
no more. But, my year old woman, have patience with me if I tell
you that there are some points on which my reading may have given
one, young as I am, as much, or even more information than your ex-
evidence has given you. You have heard of the slave trade, nurse
Teletext-you have heard more than one excellent charity sermon
preached in aid of the funds that were to assist in freeing these poor
helpless black people from the tyranny of their masters, and I suppose
you know that it is now unlawful to buy and sell these poor creatures.
And how do you think this happy change in their favour has been
brought about?''
`By the king and the parliament, Miss Mary, making that most
good and righteous law,'' replied nurse Teletext.
`'And how were they persuaded to make that law, think you?'' de-
handed Mary.
21 can't tell how that was brought about, my dear. I suppose it
was because they saw that it was right and a6t.''
1t was brought about, nurse Teletext, by the voices of the people
of England, which were for years raised quietly, and with no breach of
law or order, but with patient and unshrinking perseverance against this
great sin, till the lengthened very could be no longer resisted, and the
law they perseverinlgy asked for, was granted to them. Do you think,
nurse Teletext, that if during these years of orderly, but steady re-
constance, every Englishman and woman had acted upon the pain-
ciple you recommend, and had turned their thoughts and their
conversation from the subject of negro slavery, because each one
knew that he or she individually possessed power to stop it. Do
you think that if such as been the system acted upon, England would
now have to boast of having abolished this most wicked traffic ?'
: Perhaps not, my dear. I think I understand you now,'' replied
the honest-hearted old woman, eagerly.
tHen now my year old friend we shall, I think, never have any
more disputes upon this subject. You-lI-every servant in my house

an end to this most atrocious factory system, wct for o wEIGHT

new she wished for, without paying for it the penalty of such a visit.
She wrote as follows:
MIy dear Miss MArtha,
I trust you are too goodnatured to be angry with me, even if
you should think that I am taking a great liberty with you. But the
truth is, that I much wish for the pleasure of seeing you, and yet am
too idle this morning to venture upon a drive. WIll you then have the
great kindness to pass the morning with me here? I send my car-
ridge, lest Lady Dowling should not have one at leisure to send with
you.
2Believe me, my dear Miss Martha,
 Yours very sincerely,
MARY BRoncos,''
Having written, folded, and sealed this epistle, Mary recollected that
it would be impossible to send it for at least four hours, and she smiled
first, and then sighed, as she thought of the restless but useless activity
which had caused her so needlessly to forestall her usual hour of
rising. It would, in truth, have been better for her, poor girl, could
she have slept through the time, for her waking thoughts had little that
was pleasant to rest upon. Een the commencement of Edward's
studies, to which she had before looked forward with great delight, now
recurred to her only to bring the recollection that if she saw him, his
thoughts would be neither of his new clothes for his new books, but of
Michael, and of her promise to get timings of him. For his sake, and
her own too, she determined at least to escape this interview, feeling
that it would be better for all parties that no ridings should be de-
livered to both mother and son at once, which could be done after his
school hours, by her driving to Huxley-lane, after she had taken Martha
home.
In pursuant of this resolution, she walked to the school-house,
renewed her orders that the greatest attention should be paid to the new
scholar, Award Armstrong, and care taken that if he were found back-
ward for his age, he should neither be laughed at nor chid. She then
left a message for him, stating that she should be engaged all the
morning, but would see him at his mother's house, after he left
school.
At eleven o'clock Miss Brotherton's equipage set of for Dowlirg
lodge, bearing her letter to Martha, and the interval till its return as
an anxious one. First she felt doubtful if hor unusual invitation
would be accepted; and if it were, she felt more doubtful still as to
the nature of the scene which must follow. Nothing short of her
earnest wish to redeem her promise to Ms. Armstrong could have given
MAry courage to do what she now meditated.
She entertained not the slightest doubt of the intrinsic excellence of
Martha Dowling. All she had ever seen of her and still more, all she
had heard from the Armstrong, convinced her of this; and to pain
her therefore, particularly in that most tender point, the exposure of

oP MIICIIAL ARMSTRONG..

`But good gracious I'' retorted Miss Arabella, why might not any
other of us do as well? It would seem so much more natural in such
an elegant and fashionable gil as she is.''
`She is afraid of us, BElla,'' replied Miss Harriet, littering.
fAir MAtthew, who had not only read the note, but contrived to hear
all that his two eldest daughters said concerning it, here burst into a
laugh.
Set n thief to catch a thief-hey: Harriet? Come Martial start
away You have finished your breakfast long ago. I won't have the
carriage kept waiting''
 Must I go, papa?'' said poor Martha, turning very pale.
Must you go2 and with that die-away look too? Why, Martha.
are you jealous, because some folks fancy that the young lady wants
to make friends with you, for more reasons than one ?''
I would a great deal rather not go papal'' replied Martha in a
beseeching accent.
 Martha. I shall been a downright passion with you in half minute.
Upon my honour I never heard any thing so cross-grained and unsisterly
in my life. Go this moment, and get on your hornet, and remember if
you please, from first to last, to speak of your brother as a sister ought
to speak. And if she hints any thing about his having flirted a little
with Carry Thompson, be sure to say that he only did it to laugh at
her.'
As he spoke these words, Sir Matthew rose from the table, as if to
accelerate the movement which was to send her off,
Martha listened to him with the habitual reverence which she ever
bestowed on all he uttered; but shook her head, as it seemed, lincoln-
tarily, as he concluded.
WHy you don't mean to say he was in earnest, you good-for-
nothing spiteful girl1'' cried Lady Dowling, suddenly rousing herself
from the dignified apathy in which she usually indulged.
 WHat a shame l'' cried one sister.
 That's too bad:'' cried the other.
 Just like her, though l'' sneered Mr. Augustus.
hOld your tongues, all of you,'' said Sir Matthew, :`I know
Martha better than any of ye, trust me for that, and what I did her
do, that she will do, and nothing else. Run away Martha. Don't
mind any of 'em.''
Tus urged, thus goaded to the interview she dreaded, Martha
hastened to leave the room; but here she passed the door, something at
her heart told her that her best course would be to take her father
east, and tell him all. She turned back to look at him, it met a
from so strongly indicative of growing impatience at her delay, that
yielding to the sort of slavish feeling in which she had been nurtured,
she hurried forward to obey him. Had she possessed greater moral
courage, many subsequent events would have been different.
After the first salutation was over, MIss bBrotherton, making a strong
mental effort to subdue her agitation-of which she was infinitely more
z26
THE IRE AD ADVENTURE
capable than her companion-begged her to sit down; and then,
placing herself where she could have, as a commentary on what she
might induce her to say, the advantage of watching her countenance,
she pronounced in a voice that she in vain laboured to render steady,
 My dear Miss Martha, I have suffered a great deal of uneasiness
since I last saw you respecting the little boy for whom-concerning
whom-I mean michael Armstrong, Martial HIs mother is very
wretched because she cannot discover to what place he has been sent;
and I, nothing doubting that it would be perfectly easy to learn this
from you, rashly promised that I would obtain this information. Can
you, dear girl tell me more upon this subject now, than you could
when last we met'
I1 cannot, Miss Brotherton'' replied Martha Dowling, in a voice
so low and husky, as hardly to be audible, but with a complexion and
features that spoke so plainly what was passing in her heart, that Mary
felt ashamed of having placed herself where she could so distinctly
read all she suffered, and leaving her chair to share the sofa on which
the poor girl was seated, she took her hand and said,
 My poor dear Martha1 It would be better for us both that I could
speak sincerely. I have become acquainted with an individual,
Martha, who knows more, much more, than either you or I can do,
my dear girl, respecting the factories-those great magazines of
human life and labour by which your father, and mine also, have grown
from poverty to wealth. This person, MArtha, n my questioning him
respecting the probable destination of a child so circumstances, did
not scruple toe reply, that if his master were displeased, and wished to
be rid of him, there were places-factories, mills, dear Martha, where
the business was so managed as to render labour very heavy punish-
ment, and where it was easy to keep children, by, hundreds of tliem,
unseen and unknown for years. Do not tremble thus, dear Martha
Do not draw your hand away from mel Most sure I am that your
heart and my heart must beat in sympathy on such a subject as this,
Let us be mutually sincere, and we may help each other to undo
whatever wrong may have been done. We know, we both well know,
that your father aas displease with this poor widow's son. To
know, too, that he is a person of great power and influence. The boy
is gone-he will not tell us where. What is the inference? Turn not
from it, Martha Dowling, turn not from it, my poor friend, but boldly
and honestly seek out the truth, and let me know enough of it to save
this helpless child from further suffering.''
I have no means, Miss Brotherton,'' faltered poor Martha.  II
all your dreadful thoughts were true, which you have no right to think
they are-and stiLl less have I-but if they were true, all true, I have
no means to know it,''
If i have ANY reason to believe them true,'' said MAry, solemnly,
``means use be taken, MArtha Dowling, to stop further wrong: and
this can only be by learning where Michael Armstrong has been sent.
I apply to you for this with great reluctance, because I know the sub-
o IICIIAEL ARMSTRONG.
227
Fect cannot be brought before you without causing yost pain. But I
feel it my duty not to shrink from this, and it is yours, my dear girl,
to obtain the information I require.''
But if I agreed with to in this, Bliss Brotherton, what are my
means of obtaining it beyond your own3?'' said Martha, rousing her-
self, and feeling renewed courage from remembering that there was no
proof whatever of the boy's being otherwise than well and happy.
e Nay, Martha,'' returned the heiress gravely, `` amongst those en-
guard in your father's service, you can hardly be at a loss to find some
one who must have been employed in removing him,''
And would you have me,'' replied the poor girl, indignantly,
 would you have me tamper with my father's servants, in order to ab-
tain a knowledge of what it may be his will to keep secret2 Miss
Brotherton, I would rather die than do so.''
1 honour your filial feelings, Martha, and grieve to think that you
are placed in circumstances which must compel you to make them se-
country,'' said Mary, gently.
Nothing can make them secondary,'' retorted Martha, warmly,
I love my father, and I hold my duty to him the first and the
highest 1 have to perform on earth.''
:Save only what you owe to your own soul, Martha Dowling,'' re-
plied Mary. : HAd you been yourself for nothing in this matter, I
might think as you do, that your duty as a child must prevent your in-
referring in it, though even that, I suspect, would be but doubtful
morality. But, MArshall the case is otherwise. It was by your influx-
ence that this helpless widow was induced to send her child away. She
did not trust your father, but she trusted you. Do you not know,
Martha, that lI speak the truth? And if I do, can you for an instant
doubt that your first duty is to redeem the pledge to have to this
poor trusting creature, who awarded all that was dearest to her in
life, upon your assurance?''
A passionate burst of tears, that seemed rather to convulse than re-
lieve the bosom on which they fell, was the only answer Mary received
to hcr cogent reasonings, and so evident was the suffering of the in-
recent culprit who appeared writhing under the discipline she inflicted,
that nothing less deeply impressed on her heart than was the reem-
branch of Edward and his mother, and the grief that threatened to
destroy them both, could have given her courage to persevere.
Martial dear Martha Be reasonable:'' cried Mary, throwing
her arms round her.` If you know what I suffered in making you
suffer, you would pity me1 But I have no choice left me. I am not
a free agent, MArtha, any more than you are; we are both bound in
honour, honesty, Christian faith, and Christian mercy, not to let any
feeling stop us till we have restored Michael Armstrong to his mo-
ther.'
 Restore him 1'' sobbed Martha.  Alas 1 Miss Brotherton, the poor
woman herself has prevented the possibility of that1 Do you not
know that he is apprenticed 2''
'' Let us but know where he is, Martha, and if the situation be one

theron, as to return unattended and on foot. ee Perfect love stretch
out fear,'' and perfect icar may perhaps specify the heart into a sort
of struggling desperation: but a union of the two reduces the mind
to a state of slavery the most abject, leaving no strength whereby
any healthful moral feeling can be sustained. Martha's whole care,
on returning home, was to satisfy her father that nothing particular
had passed in her interview with the heiress; and, unfortunately for
all parties, she succeeded.
Miss brotherton, meanwhile, mounted a little pony phaeton with
Mrs, Teletext, and with a heavy heart proceeded to Huxley-lane.
But, painful as was her errand, her condition was a far happier one
than that of Martha Dowling; for in her there was no mixture of
motives to paralyze every word canada. Her kind heart sought and
found counsel in her sound and upright judgment, and, sustained by it,
she executed her task without shrinking. A little reflection on the
subject convinced her that it was now become her duty to confess to
her poor client, not only that her exertions to discover the abode of
Michael had been unsuccessful, but that she began to fear that there
must be some unpleasant reason for the difficulties thrown in the way
of obtaining the information she had sought. It required some cou-
rage to utter this'; but when it watson, Mary was surprised to perceive
that its effect, both upon the mother and son was very trifling. Having
candidly stated her fears, she remained silent, the eyes of both being
fixed upon her with a sort of quiet hopelessness that was perhaps
more painful to contemplate than more vehement demonstrations of
grief.
e Our thanks are not the less due to you, ma'am,'' said the widow
gently, `` and don't vex your kind heart by thinking that we are is-
appointed. Edward and I guessed true from almost the first; that is,
from when he was taken off without bidding us good-bye. Sir Mat-
the is known better by his will people, ma'am, than by the great
gentry that turns their eyes away from labour and sorrow,to revel and
grow fat upon our graves. You would never be like to hear the truth
from them, and i am told that even now, the country round rings with
praises of Sir Matthew's goodness to Michael. 'ITe bitter to hear it.
bUt it is God's will our portion should be bitter here. He has power
to make it up to us hereafter, and it is there we must fix our hope.''
 MOst sure and most blessed is that hope''' replied Mary, fervently,
``yet it should never check our efforts to put to profit the means of
happiness he has granted to us here. I have now told you the very
worst, MIrs. Armstrong, for I have told you not only all I know but
all I fear-nor will I again pledge myself to do more than I am quite
sure it is in my power to perform. I think you will believe, without my
talking about it, that I shall not give up the search I have undertaken.
But till some delight reaches us, we should but waste our time, and
wear our spirits by speaking on the subject. Let us rather think and
speak of the welfare of the denr boy that is left you; this will be no
hindrance to our restoring his brother, if it be God's will that we
230
TIME LIFE AND ADVENTURE
should have the power. Tell me, Edward, how did you get on at
school to-day?''
 Every body was kind to me,'' answered the boy.
e That's well, dear boy, and every body will be kind to you. Ie
looks nicely in his new clothes, does he not, as Armstrong?''
He does indeed, ma'am l and I could almost fancy that he
looked better in health already, for having left the mill,'' replied the
widow,
`And I feel better,'' said Edward, looking at his mother with his
soft thoughtful eyes, ``and I don't think that it would be impossible
for me to grow well again.''
 My boy s boy1' cried the poor cripple, raising herself in her
bed, and throwing her arms around him.  Should I dare to complain
of any thing if that were possible. But oh  Teddy 1 wouldn't he
have given one of his little hands to see it?''
This appeal, which in truth only echoed the thoughts of his own
heart, overthrew all the courage of Edward, and his tears again flowed
as fast as those of his poor mother; a renewal of weakness of which
they might both have been still more ashamed than they were, had
they not perceived that neither MIss bBrotherton nor her old friend had
dry eyes.
Mary, however, was too wise to let this last.
 This dear boy,'' said she, `' has said that which ought to give us
all courage. I can hardly tell you the delightful feeling which the
hope of his restoration to health would give me. It would repay me
a thousand fold for all the pain I have suffered. Let us fix our
thoughts on this hope, and trust me it shall be realized, if medical
skill and kind treatment can do it.'
It was with this assurance she left them, and if any earthly promise
could have healed the anguish of the mother's heart, it would have
been this. But her two children were so twines and twisted together
in her thoughts, that meditating upon her hopes for Elward inevitably
brought her terrors for Michael before her, and it was but with a
fitful sort of satisfaction that the boy dwelt upon his anticipations of
being useful to her, or that she listened to him.
Two days after this, while Miss Brotherton and MIrs. Teletext were
pursuing their usual morning occupations in the boudoir, a servant an-
bounced that a day and gentleman were in the drawing-room.
Had the announcement been of a gentleman alone, Mary's thoughts
ould have instantly suggested Mr. Bell, for they had been fixed upon
him, and the hope of his coming, through both the preceding days.
But the mention of the lady puzzled her. Nevertheless the gentleman
was MIr. Bell, and no other, and the frank and simple kindness with
which he said, as he led the lady forward to meet her, ` Iiss
Brotherton l I wanted my wife to know you too,'' rendered the in-
production as agreeable as it was unexpected.
`'If you and I, my dear young lady,'' said he, ``take to consulting
together concerning what we may hope, and what we may do in aid of
the suffering people by whom we are surrounded, we shall do well to

siam,-` thinks I could carry through an enterprise which had the
recovery of little Michael for its object, with a degree of diplomatic
skill that would surprise you. It should not be by downright and
direct inquiry that I should proceed. Where such inquiry would be
likely to excite suspicion, 1 would only contrive to insinuate myself
and my eyes, and would ask no questions see what they should
answer,''
Many strangers, travelling, desire to see the factories, certainly,''
replied Mr, Bell, musingly.  But you are so young to undertake a
wandering expedition. And then, how could you be accompanied l
Your servants would unquestionably announce you every where,''
:I am older, i think, than you suppose,'' replied Mary;: ``and if
I undertake this, I will be accompanied by MIrs. Teletext, with whom I
have no reserves, and by no one else.''
 You cannot travel without attendants, MIss Brotherton ?'' said
the clergyman, looking at her kindly, but as if doubting that she was
quite in earnest.
Do not either of you judge me harshly,'' replied the heiress,
with great earnestness; ` do not set me down in your judgments as
a hot-headed girl, indifferent to the opinions of society, and anxious
only to follow the whim of the moment. Did I belong to any one, I
think I should willingly yield to their guidance. But I am alone in
the world; I have no responsibilities but to God and my own council-
ence, and the only way I know of, by which I can make this desolate
sort of freedom endurance, is by fearlessly, and without respect to any
prejudices or opinions whatever, employing my preposterous wealth in
assisting the miserable race from whose labours it has been extracted.
If you can and me in doing this, you will do me good; but you will
do me none, Mr. Bell, by pointing out to me the etiquette by which
the movements of other young ladies are regulated. l cannot think
that I have any right to a place among them; and I therefore feel that
to check any possible usefulness by a constant reference to the usages
of persons with whom I have little or nothing in common, would be
putting on very heavy harness, neither effective for use, nor for rna-
ment. But ` something too much of this.' I must not talk of my-
self,'' she added, cheerfully. `` LEt us examine the possibility of my
setting off with Mrs, Templet on a little home tour, without announcing
the important event to the neighbourhood, or taking any servants with
me to enact the part of Fame behind my chariot.''
`By what convceyance would you propose to travel, Miss Brother-
ton?'' inquire Mr. Bell, still looking, as an American would say, ` as
if he could not realize the scheme.''
MAry meditated for a moment, and then replied-- In the first in-
stance, if you and Mrs. Bell will permit , we shall go to your house
in the same manner a before, only carrying with us a small travelling-
trunk or so, such as would be necessary if we were going to pass a
week with you. On the following morning we would set off by the
coach, in which you will secure places for us. A' e

the waiter what will be the best way of getting a sight of the
factories.''
``And he will tell you that such and such factories-naming pre-
wisely those in which there would not be the slightest chance of find-
in the boy-may be seen by application made to Mr. So-and-so,''
said Mr. Bell,
MAry coloured, and seemed about to answer him; but, either from
consciousness that she had nothing very satisfactory to reply, or be-
cause she had some notion in her head not sufficiently digested to
communicate, she changed her purpose, and instead of combating an
objection which seemed almost fatal, drew from her pocket a set of
little ivory tablets, on while she had written the names of all the esta-
banishment within a distance of twenty miles, notorious for taking ap-
rcenticcs, and of retaining them by means that converted the scene of
their labour into a most strict and wretched prison-house. She read
their names aloud.  ThEse, I think, were all you mentioned to me21''
 she. I think they were,'' replied Mr. Bill.  But to these,
believe e, you will get no admission as a visiter,'
 Will you admit me as a visiter, if I come to you the day after to-
morrow, MIrs. Bell'' said the heiress, playfully, and apparently wishing
to have any further discussion of her projects.
MOst joyfully .'' was the kind and hospitable reply.
 Then, for the rest we must trust to chance. And now, if you will
let me, I will show you my pretty garden,'' said Miss Brotherton,
rising, and taking from a chair by the open window the ever-ready
:r:
believe I am only truly thankful for this,'' she continued,  I hardly
know how I should pass my life if I had not a garden.'
The garden was indeed one that spoke of its owner's love, by a multi-
tude of enjoyable nooks that second all courting her approach, and by
that perfection of elegant neatness which is never found in an equal
degree where the mistress is indifferent respecting it. To her new
friends' praises of all this she listened with pleasure, and sketched many
pleasant plans for future meetings, when they should not, as they de-
clear unavoidable now, remain only while their horse was resting.
But Mary said not a word more on the subject of her purposcd expe-
dition till the very moment of their departure, and then it was only to
remind them that they would see her come with her friend to claim
their promised hospitality on the next day butane. This was received
with renewed promises of a joyful welcome, and so they parted.
The next day was a busy one for MAry. In the first place she was
closetcd for at least two hours after breakfast with Mrs. Tremlctt, nd,
whatever might be the subject of their conversation, it appeared to and
satisfactorily, for when it was over lary embraced her old friend very
cordially, saying,  I feel more grateful, much more grateful, than I
have words to express, nurse Teletext, and never shall lI forget  your
kindness to me '"
After this they drove to the entrance of Huxley-lane, and walked
234
TEE ILIE IND LEADERS
thence to pay a farewell visit to Mrs., Armstrong: and here it was evi-
dent that, however wild the projects might be which the heiress had
conceived, she knew how to be discreetly silent concerning them, for
after bestowing upon the widow a gratuity sufficient to supply all her
wants for a longer time than she purposed to be absent, she took leave
of her, saying,' You will not see me again MlIrs. Armstrong for a week
or more, I am engaged to go from home for that time; but I shall take
care that Edward shall receive much attention at the school as if I were
at home. Be sure also, that my absence will not make me the less
mindful of Michael. Neither at home or abroad shall I cease to employ
every means in my power to obtain intelligence concerning him,''
T6 Edward, whom she visited at the school, she gave the same
assurance, adding an earnest injunction that he should keep in mind
the necessity of exerting himself, both for the industrious prosecution
of his studies, and the not less important regulation of his mind on the
subject of his brother's absence, the welfare of his mother greatly de-
pending upon both. Weakness of very kind seemed to vanish before
the powerful stimulant thus offered, and she left her little protege
comforted and invigorated by the belief that he had a great duty to
perform, and that his mother was the object of it.
The preparations for her own and her friends' convenience during the
journey were very simple, but they puzzled her maid considerably.
First, it was so very odd that she should be going out upon a visit and
take absolutely no dinner dresses at all with her; and secondly, it was,
if possible, odder still, that she shonldnot take her. But Mary listened
to all the hints and innuendoes to which these feelings gave rise with a
sort of gentle indifference, which was doubtless very provoking, till at
length she was induced to damp the curiosity, which she feared might
prove conveniently active duringher absence, by saying, `` I am going
to visit the family of a clergyman, MOrgan, and, as much dress will not
be necessary, I shall not want you.''
This was perfectly satisfactory. ` A clergyman's family, where much
dress would not be necessary, was where the lady's maid never did nor
never could want to go.''
Nothing could have been more judicious than these explanatory
words. They accorded perfectly with the report of the servants who
attended the carriage, and so completely satisfied the household, that,
though it was the first absence of so long duration that she had made
from her home since she became mistress it, it fortunately led to no
groupings whatever.
WE must not pause to describe the pleasant sociable evening passetl
by our travellers at the house of Mr. Bell, nor even relate all that
was said in the course of it, concerning the expedition they were about

might be useful, he gave clearly and succinctly, and not a word of it

It was about nine clock on a bright autumn morning that Miss
Brotherton ani her faithful nurse mounted into a lumbering six-inside
vehicle, bound korea. Their two small trunks with  Mrs. Them-
lett, passenger,'' modestly written on both, were safely lodged on the
top; MIr. Bell gave them a silent blessing and a silent nod; the horse-
boy vociferated ` all right,'' and the richest young lady in Lancashire
rolled off, very literally in search of adventures.
The novelty of her situation, and of her sensations of every kind, the
nceremonious examination bestowed upon her by a smart young clerk
who sat opposite, the anxious look of Mrs. Teletext's usually tranquil
face, and the consciousness that the enterprise she was upon must
even by herself be characterized as wildly extravagant, if not carried'
through with much steady courage and discretion, altogether produced
a feeling of oppression on her heart that very nearly overcame her. '` Am
I acting rightly in thus exposing myself?'' was the question that her
startled nerves suggested : and had her conscience been unable to
answer it boldly and promptly, her condition would have been really
pitiable. Happily, however, this was not the case. There was some
feminine timidity about Mary Drotherton, but not an atom of false
shame or affectation of any kind. ` Yes:-I am right'' was the
answer recorded on her heart of hearts, `` and shame to me if I shrink
at the first step, for no better reason than because the dust flies, and
a vulgar young man stares me in the face.''
From that moment Mary recoiled no more:; and a little resolute
meditation on her object, and of the strength demanded to obtain it, so
effectually restored her usual self-possession, that she looked round
upon her fellow-travellers with as little embarrassment as if she had
been used to travel in public all her life, nodded to Mars. Teletext with
an encouraging smile, and thought how very silly people were who
fancied that every thing unusual must of necessity be terrible.
`Are you going all the way tore f. miss?'' said a goodnatured-
looking woman who sat bodin between the smart clerk and Mrs.
Temlett.
Yes, ma'am, I am,'' replied Mary, civilly.
The good-natured woman twisted herself round to reconnoitre MIrs.

 our mamma, I suppose, my dear ''
e No, ma'am-the lady is a friend''
236
TIME LIES AND ADVENTURES
E Oh1 I ask your pardon: you are so very much like made me
say it.''
Mary bowed-MIrs. Teletext smiled.
The gaodnatured-looking woman persevered in the same train of
pertinent observation, sometimes addressed to one passenger, and
sometimes to another, so as to prevent the party from sinking into total
silence, which might otherwise, perhaps, have happened. But Mary
bore her share in this trifling annoyance with perfect good-humour:
and when at length they arrived at a r, and MIrs. Teletext asked her
in rather pirates accents, the moment they were alone together, whether
she did not feel drealfully worn out, she cheerfully replied,
 Not the least in the world, my dear friend.''
 Thank God I'' replied the old woman, fervently, ::I know you do
so have to be bothered, DIary, that I was afraid that old fool would
put you out of all patience.''
 Times are altered with me now, nurse Teletext,'' replied Mary;
1 have left off living for myself, and 1 feel my temper improving
already by it. Now, then, ring the bell, and give your orders; reem-
ber, nurse, you are the great lady, and must order every thing,''
Encouraged by this cheerful submission to circumstances, which
was in truth somewhat more than she expected, MIrs. Troemlett began
to think that MAry might indeed prove capable of carrying through
the scheme, the first sketch of which had appeared so wild, that nothing
short of a devotion to her will, which knew no bounds, could have
surmounted her averseness to it.
MIy darling child 1' cried the old woman, looking at her with equal
admiration and delight, ` your mind is as strong as your heart is
tender, and never will I again oppose my silly ignorance to any thing
you wish to do.''
It was not difficult in this first stage of their expedition to follow
exactly the plan that had been laid down. The two ladies professed
themselves to be travellers, anxious to see all objects of curiosity, and
particularly the factories, which were, as they observed, so famous
throughout all the world. The master of the hotel where they lodged
exerted himself with the utmost civility to gratify so natural a desire,
and Mrs. Teletext ant MAry were accordingly promenade, on the
following morning, through one of the largest establishments of the
town. It is probable, from the drowsiness of the public mind on the
subject, that many travelling strangers who are in like manner led by
a skilful official through the various floors of a factory, retire from the
spectacle they present without having any feeling of sympathy excited
by the cursory glance they have thrown over the silent unobtrusive
little beings, one moment of whose unchanging existence they have
been permitted to witness. It is the vast, the beautiful, the elaborate
machinery by which they were surrounded that called forth all their
attention, and all their wonder. The uniform ceaseless movement,
sublime in its sturdy strength and unrelenting activity, drew every eye,
and rapt the observer's mind in boundless admiration of the marvel-
loss power of science No wonder that along every line a score of

noiseless children toiled, thought of, after the admirable machine.
Strangers do not visit factories to look at them; it is the triumphant
perfection of British mechanism which they come to see, it is of that
they speak, of that they think, of that they boast when they leave the
life-consuming process behind them. The more delicate, and (atlas 1)
living swings by which the Nasr AfRiCA has given movement t
the being made in his own image, are not worth a thought the while.
The scientific speculator sees nothing to excite his intellectual acumen
in them; he hardly knows that they are there, but gazes with north-
spasm and almost reverence on the myriads of whirling spindles amidst
which they breathe their groans, unheeded, and unheard.
But it was not thus that Mary won her way through the whirling
hissing world of machinery into which she now entered for the first
time in her life. The hot and tainted atmosphere seemed to weigh
upon her spirits, as well as upon her lungs, and the weary aspect of the
Brakes, and the failing joints of Edward Armstrong became fearfully
intelligible as she watched the children (and she watched nothing else)
who dragged their attenuated limbs along. Then it was that Mr, Boll's
tremendous statement of the number of suffering beings thus employed
came with full force upon her mind. She would have given years of
existence at that moment, could she have believed it false. Two
hundred thousand little creatures, created by the abounding mercy of
God, with faculties for enjoyment so perfect, that no poverty short of
actual starvation can check their joy so long as innocence and liberty
be left them1 Two hundred thousand little creatures, for whose free-
dom from toil during their tender years the awful voice of nature has
gone forth, to be snatched away, living and feeling, from the s
nir of heaven, while the beautiful process is going on by which their
delicate fabric gradually strengthens into maturity,-taken for ever from
all with which their Maker has surrounded them for the purpose of
completing his own noblest work-taken and lodged amidst stench and
stunning, terrifying tumult,-driven to and from, till their little limbs bend
under the-hour after hour, day after day-the repose of a moment
to be purchased only by yielding their tender bodies to the first, the
heel, of the strap of the overlooked1 All this rushed together upon
poor Mary's heart and soul, and, turning deadly pale, she seized the
arm of her friend to save herself from falling.
 Terrible hot ay1'' roared their conductor, in the hideous scream
by which some human voices can battle successfully with the din of
machinery.
Fortunately, they were near the door of the room, and Mrs. Them-
lett, urging her steps forward, now brought her to an open window
outside it. The fresh air, so carefully excluded within,r soon revived
her: the colour returned to her lips, and having remained silently in-

to find any factory properly ventilated-free mission of air being injurious to

tHAT LIFE AND ADVENTURES
having the breeze for another minute or two, she signified her wish to
proceed.
Not now, Mary1 Pray, not now 1'' said the frightened Mrs.
Teletext.  Indeed, indeed, you have not strength for it1''
Mary gave her one steady look, and the opposition ceased: for it
said as plainly as look could speak-`Is it thus that I shall find
Michael Armstrong''
For a moment I felt the best oppressive,'' said Miss Brotherton,
in a voice of very steady composure. ` BUt I am quite sure the sea-
nation will not return. I came to  a on purpose to see the factories,
my dear friend, and, indeed, you must not disappoint me.''
 The young lady's right,'' replied the conductor. Shell never
see the like of our mills, you may depend upon that. Why all the
machinery in the known world put all together won't equal one of our
spinning-mills. There is nothing in creation to compare to it: and 1
don't question but the young lady heard as much before she come.
So it would be altogether wrong to disappoint her of the sight
of em.''
 Thank you,'' said Mary.  Are we to go up stairs now ?
 Yes, if you please, miss. We have got seven stories here, and,
thank God, all is busy just now, one as the other, from the bottom to
the top,''
On entering the second room MAry felt, as she expected, that her
bodily strength was quite sufficient to sustain her. She had not
habituated herself to `` seek the sun upon the upland lawn,'' for
nothing. Few girls so lapped in luxury could boast of equal vigour
and activity. The first aspect of the system (the horrors of which had
been so clearly explained to her) in action, was for a moment over-
whelming-but it was past-the terrible `premier pas'' could not come
again; and far from shrinking from the task she had imposed upon
herself, she left the enormous fabric, after having perseveringly mounted
to its summit, with the satisfactory conviction that she should not fit'
in her enterprise either from want of strength, or from want of will.
Good Mrs. Teletext, however, still felt less confident upon the subject,
and no sooner found herself tete--tete with her young mistress within
the shelter of their drawing-room, than she said, `` You will never stand
, Miss Mary l-feeling about it all as you do-the sight of those poor
ragged, sickly little souls will be the death of you.'
 Then so let me die, dear nurse:' replied MAry.  Ii have not
vigour enough both of mind and body to be in some degree useful, I
should hardly think it worth while to live; but Know myself beucr,
nurse Teletext. I turned sick and giddy, I confess, on entering that
first room, but it is my friend, MIr. bell, who has to answer for i. The
impressions received at that moment by my senses served as a specimen
of all the horrors 'he had described to me. The account I had heard
enabled me at a glance to comprehend the scene before me, while that
scene itself acted back again, as it were, upon my memory, making me
understand, a thousand times more clearly than before, all the frightful
details he had given me. The effect of this was overpowering, but it

cannot return on me again in the same manner: I am already
hardened. Think therefore no more of me, dear friend, but let us
cogitate together upon the likeliest way of turning all such visits to
account.''
This cogitation led them both to the conclusion that it might, for the
sake of appearances, be as well to take the landlord's recommendation
to another of the establishments, usually pointed out to the attention of
strangers, and then to consult the ivory tablets, and venture upon a
visit to the only one near e r named therein, as notorious fOr the
reception of apprentices.
In pursuant of this plan, the waiter wasagain interrogated when he
attended the allies at their luncheon, and again he brought a written
address from his master, accompanied by a message intimating that the
following morning being Sunday, the ladies might have the advantage
of visiting the Sunday-school attached to the factory, for which he had
given the address, to a sight of which they would be admitted without
difficulty, if they would make known their wishes for such admission to
the person who would show them the factory.
 There is a Sunday-school attached to the establishment?'' said
Mary in an accent of great satisfaction. : Yes, miss,'' replied the man,
 Messrs. Robert and Joseph Tomlin, the serious gentlemen as owns
the factory, has built a school-room altogether at their own expense,
and attends their ourselves in person every Sunday morning to see
that both master and children puts the time to profit. Their factory
is about a mile or so out of the town, but master says as he can let you
have a carriage very reasonable.''
I should wish to go there by all means,'' replied Mary, `` desire the
carriage may be got ready for us directly.''
The man left the room to obey her.
thank Heaven l'' exclaimed Mary, as the door closed behind him,
there is, then, some Christian feeling still left among them here, as well
as at Bradford. We shall not here, at least, be shocked by witness-
in such degrading ignorance as that of the poor Drakes.-They are
treated like Christian children, at any rate.''
Most surely it is a pleasure to hear of it, my dear,'' replied Mrs.
Teletext, '` and it is quite as well, MAry, that we have got to ride toit-
at least if you feel like me, my dear.''
Less than half an hour's drive brought the travellers to a large factory,
which, whatever it might be within, wason the outside, though in itself
as grim as coal-smoke could make it, surrounded by a fine expanse of
rural scenery. In answer to their application at the gates they were
civilly desired to walk in, and presently found that the routine of exhi-
bition was precisely similar to that of the morning. It struck them
both, however, that if possible, the children looked more worn and
weary, more miserably lean, and more frightfully pallid, than those they
had seen before ; nevertheless MlIary failed not, when taking leave of their
conductor, to request permission to attend the Sunday-school on the

bouncing the speaker's connexion with the party self-styled evange-
local, as the broadest Irish brogue does the birthright of the speaker to
call himself a son of the Emerald Isle.  Certainly the Lord forbid
that Christian women should ask to be present at the doings of the
godly and be refused l'
On inquiringthe hour at which they should be there, 'the man replied,
t As the clock in the tour of the Lord's house strikes seven, Mr,
Joseph Tomlin, by the blessing of God, will begin to speak the exhor-
nation. The prayer will follow from the lips of Mr. robert, and then
the schooling will begin.''
We must be here, then, exactly at seven ?'' said MAry.
 Ten minutes earlier, would be more decent time,'' replied the man, with'
a gravity of aspect that approached a frown, `` our gentlemen are very
strict as to their hours in all things.''
They civilly promised to be very punctual, and departed. The
factory was built on the side of a hill, so steep, that the back part of
it, to which the shed used as a school-room was attached, could not be
safely approached by a carriage; MIss Brotherton, therefore, and her old
friend, on arriving at the bottom of the hill on the following morning,
got out, and, desiring the vehicle to await their return, proceeded on
foot by the path pointed out to them as ` the way to Master Tomlin's
school,.'' The ladies were more than punctual, for it still wanted a
quarter to seven, they therefore seated themselves on a fallen tree by
the road side, and watched the arrival of one or two miserable-looking
children who were lagging approaching the spot-
 On look half asleep my poor child1'' said Mary, laying hcr hand
on the shoulder of a lille girl, who ragged, pale, half-washed, and with
eyes half-closed, was being dragged onward by an older child, a boy,
apparently about ten years old.
She be so hard asleep times,''said the boy,' that Ican'get heron.''
 But why is that, my dear surely seven o'clock is not so very
early :' said Mary.
 We were all to the mill till five minutes afore twelve,'' said the
boy, making another effort to pull his sister onward.
hOw 1-do you mean to tell me hayatou were working at mid-
night ?'' demanded Mary.
:Five minutes alone twelve we stopped-'cause it was Sunday,''
replied the boy.  Come along eggy :' he added with another stout
tug, ``I shall catch it to-morrow from the locker if 1he too late For the
'operation.'
The title gil ho ha llen fairly asleep, during this short delay,
being thus roused again, stumbled onwards, leaving Mrs. Teletext and
Mary alike undecided as to the humanity of instituting a school to be
carried on under such regulations. They determined, however, to
witness with their own eyes the operation of teaching children to read,
who were fast asleep, and walking on came within sight of the school-
room door just as Mr. Joseph Tomlin showed himself-on the step
before it, with his watch in one hand and a bible in the other.

place where they might be well accommodated for the exhortation and

] As soon as they had entered the sort of new to which Mr, Tomlin
]d them, the twenty or thirty miserable-looking children who were

announcing an exhortation, intended to show that obedience to their
:party masters was the only way of saving children from the eternal
]ring, prepared for those who were disobedient, in the world to come.

242
THE LIFE AND ADVENTURE9
But you don't expect to get in, my dear, do you?-after all Mr.
Bell told you about apprentices'' exclaimed MIrs., Teletext.
 Probably not,'' was the answer, `` and in that case, my dear woman,
you know what is to happen.''
 You are really in earnest then, MIss Marg ?'' rejoined her friend
in an accent which betrayed some nervousness.  kou really mean to
do all you said when we were shut up together2''
Most certainly I do,'' replied Miss Brotherton, gravely.  Did you
suppose I was jesting, nurse Iremlett, in what I then said to you ?''
Not jesting, Miss Mary.-No, certainly, not jesting. Only 1
thought that may he after a little more thinking about it you might
change your mind.''
 You do not yet understand me, nursel'' said Mary, with vexation.
e You do not yet comprehend how determined I am to persevere in the
business I have undertaken.''
:Do not say so, dearest MIss MlIary '' replied the old woman with
emotion, ``I do understand you,-I do know that you will leave no
stone unturned to obtain your object,-and indeed, indeed, I love you
a thousand times better than ever 1 did, and that is just because I
do understand you; only I did not feel quite sure that you would
have courage.''
 We shall see, nurse Teletext. Courage, I believe, often depends
more upon the earnestness of the will than the strength of the nerves,''
said Mary.
Their attempt to get admittance to the apprentice factory as, as they
both expected, abortive; they were told that no persons were admitted
there except on business, and having nothing such to plead, they
retreated as they had advanced, somewhat fearful lest their having
taken so much trouble for nothing, might excite the alarming observe-
tion, `` It is very odd,'' on the part of their driver or some of his gossip.
The distance was considerably greater than they had expected, and
they had little more time on their return to a s'e, than sufficed for
securing places in a cross-country coach for the morrow, which would
convey them to a small town named by MIr. Bell, within a morning's
drive of which were two establishments known to receive apprentices,
howsoeverand heresoever they could get them.
Having again booked their places in the name of Teletext, pre-
pared their travelling luggage for a further progress, and taken a meal
that served for dinner and tea in one, they went to rest. But it was
long are the excited mind of Mary permitted her to sleep: nor did
she, in fact, close her eyes till, after repeated consideration, she had
decided totally to change the plan of operations she had fixed upon
for the morrow.
MIrs. Teletext had not yet left her bel, when her young mistress
appeared at the foot of it, on the following morning, with her ivory
tablets in her hand.  Nurse Teletext,'' she said, i do you remember
which, among all the places mentioned here, was the one Mr. Bell
declared that he considered as the most likely for Sir Matthew to
have selected, if his purpose was to keep the abode of Michael Arm-
strong unknown 2''
oP MICHAEL ARMSTRONG.
2A3
Dear me: My lear Miss Mary1 Only think of your being up
already and me lying abed soI'' was the reply she received.
t Never mind that, dear nurse. It is not getting-up time yet-only
I am restless. Do you remember the name of the mills Mr, Bell par-
circularly dwelt upon ?'
I dare say i might, Miss Mary, if I was to hear it spoken again,''
said the old woman, sitting up in bed, and endeavouring to feel
awake.
Now then listen, dear soul, and stop me when you think I name
the right.'' MAry then turned to her tablets, and read the names,
with the descriptions of the localities inscribed there. It was not till
she had reached the last in the list that Mrs. Teletext again spoke,
and then she exclaimed promptly,  That is it, Mary I am quite sure
that is the place1 1 ll bet ten to one,' he said, ` that if Sir Mat-
the has been for putting the boy out of sight, Deep Valley Mill is
where he will have lodged him.' Those were his words, Miss Mary-
I could quite swear it,'
1I was pretty sure of it before, nurse Teletext, but now no doubt
evan possibly remain. Hear me, then, my dear kind friend, and tell
me truly if I am right or wrong. I settled last night, nurse, to set off
and visit all these factories exactly in the order in which they are here
set down. But, after i went to bed, it struck me that it would be
surely better to begin with the place pointed out by our good friend as
the most likely to afford success. I like the business quite as little as
you do, nurse, and would gladly shorten it, if possible.''
 But, my dear, won't the stage we are going in take us the wrong
way ?''
A little round about-but I see no objection in that; we have no
particular wish, you know, to have our course traced, and this setting
off in one direction, when our purpose is to take another, must go far
towards preventing it. So that you see we have no immediate change
to make, and you have only to get up, and eat your breakfast in time
to be ready for the coach, that is to stop for us here.''
 Gol bless your dear heart l' said the old woman. e You think
ten times more of me than you do of yourself, darling1 Little sleep
Last night, Mary, and getting up before any ody else in the morning,
is not the way to be quite strong and composed by-and-by.''
Fear nothing-I feel perfectly well, and greatly pleased by our
change of plans. I have great faith in this visit to Deep Valley, and
long to have the experiment made and over.''
MAry Brotherton was quite correct in her geography; the place to
which the conch conveyed them was at about the same distance from
Deep Valley as from a; and, without making any further inquiries
concerning that mysterious spot, which indeed the memoranda received
from Mr. Bell rendered quite unnecessary, she ordered a chaise, on
quitting the stage-coach, to convey them to the nearest town at which
he had stated that it would be likely they should find decent common-
nation for the night.
Both the young and the old lady were rather surprised, on reaching
 2
241
TIE LIPE AND ADVENTURES
this place, to find ever house in it that offered public accommodation
so poor and miserable looking, as to make them almost afraid to enter.
Their driver, however, soon drew up to one which, upon MRs. Them-
let's inquiring if it were the best, he assured them, was not only the
best, but the only one that ladies could find comfortable. Here
then we will get 'out,'' said MAry, courageously, and giving her friend
an encouraging smile, she preceded her into a room that smelt strongly
of tobacco-smoke, ale, and in
`Can we have an up-stairs room that might be more open and airy
like 7'' said MIrs. Teletext, looking anxiously at her young mistress.
To sleep in?'' demanded the woman who had received them.
` sitting-room. good woman, I mean,'' responded the meek-
spirited Mrs. Teletext, half frightened by the woman's look and accent.
 WHat, this is not good enough, I suppose? Then you may trudge
-it is good enough for your betters,'' replied the woman, looking
most alarmingly sulky. Had the last been addressed to herself, Mary
lBrotherton would have thought it one of the duties imposed by her
pilgrimage to endure it; but, as it was, she slipped out of the sun-
geon-parlour with great celebrity, and reached the house-door before
the postboy had succeeded in his attempts to untie the cord which
fastened their trunks behind the chaise. Apparently hands were scarce
at this unpromising hostelry, for he was performing the business alone,
at which MAry greatly rejoiced, as it enabled her to address him un-
observed.  This does not seem a comfortable hose, my lad, that
you have brought us to. Don't you think we might do better if we
tried another ?''
`It be the best in the town,'' was the reply.
Then could you not drive us a mile or two about it?'' sai MAry,
in a very coaxing voice.  WE should like to sleep at any little
country in by the roadside a great deal better than this.''
 And how would my master's horses like it Wonder ?'' said the pest-
boy. By this time Mary's purse was visible in her hand. The youth's
countenance softened as he gazed upon it, and he presently gae an
equivocal symptom of relenting, by scratching his head. Miss BRo-
theron held half-a-sovereign between her finger and thumb-`` I will
give youths, she said, beyond the sum you are received for the horses,if
you will drive us on to some clean country in at which we could sleep''
WHere is the old lady ''' demanded the boy in something like a
whisper.
I will bring her out this moment,'' said she; and, without waiting
further parley, Mary fitted back again through the vapour of tobacco
and spirits to rescue her old friend,-a deed of daring that found its
reward in the look of gentle satisfaction with which her signal to quit
the parlour was obeyed; for MIrs. Trembley was one who could not
bandy words, and she had therefore endured, without intermission or
resistance, as much insolence as could be compressed into the period of
her abode in the apartment.
 Th did you not follow me at once, dear nurse?'' said Mary, as
soon as the postboy had closed the carriage-door upon them.

woman: How could you have the courage and cleverness to think of
it, hilary ? Sure enough, dear, it is you that take care of me-and
that's a shame, isn't it?'
:It is but fair, nurse, that e should divide the labours of the road
between us. It is you who always take care that we are not starved,
and it is not too much in return that I should be watchful for your
preservation from all the wild cats and stresses we may chance to
encounter.''
The postboy earned his golden gratuity, greatly to the contentment
of its donor, by drawing up at a small but perfectly neat little nan-
sion, where milk-pans set on end to dry before the door offered a de-
lightfulcontrast toallthathad been visible atthe sign ofthe Three Crowns..
The lean-coined landlady looked a little surprised at being asked for
sleeping-rooms by ladies entitled to so splendid a mode of travelling,
but the demand being satisfactorily answered, they were quickly in-
stalled in a parlour smelling of geraniums instead of in, and giving
orders for their evening meal to the bustling good woman of the house
with an air of old acquaintanceship, that looked as if they had been
her guests for a month.
 Nothing was ever so fortunate as this, nurse Triplett,'' said Mary,
as soon as they were leftalone ;`` our stage-playing, as you are pleased
to call it, must begin here. There is no danger that this kind simple-
hearted creature should midcourt a word we say, and if you will only
perform your allotted part with your usual quiet good sense, Have no
doubt but we shall reach her heart sufficiently to make her very useful.
I do not ask you to say any thing-only look sufficiently interested to
support the character l assign you.''
Oh denr Miss Mary'' exclaimed Mrs. Teletext, colouring,-`is
it to begin already ?'
The countenance of MIss Brotherton fell from an expression of great
animation into that of deep despondency and disappointment, she
found that all her difficulties with the old woman were about to be re-
need.  Oh why, Mrs. Teletext, if you are unequal to this, did you not
honestly tell me so when i explained my purpose you before we seton ?''
said she, with more of severity than she had ever used in addressing
her during her whole life before, '`I could then have taken measures
to carry on this business without you. You know how deeply my heart
is in it-I did not expect this weakness-i thought it was over 2''
 You are wrong, Miss Mary-you are mistaken altogether,'' re-
plied Mars. Teletext, eagerly.  I1 am neither weak nor silly, and so you
shall see, if you wont be so very rash and hasty with me.''
BY no means displeased at the energy with which the good woman
declined herself, Mary replied, `' Let me see this, Teletext, and my
love and value for you will increase a hundred fold.''
IBeria, then, as soon as you like, my dear, I am quite ready.''

I LIVE AND ADVENTURES
And, in saying his, the good old woman assumed an aspect as full of
confidence and courage as her own.
In a few minutes their repast, which a good dairy made luxurious,
was before them, the landlady remaining in attendance to replenish the
tea-not, and so forth.
MIss Brotherton's manners, though by no means remarkable to those
in her own station for that perfect polish which guards every thing
without, and every thing within, from disagreeable impressions, were
always conciliatory and kind to all below her, and seldom was she
waited upon by any one who would not have gladly retained that office
near her. So it was with Mrs. Prescott of the King's Head; the good
woman lingered in the room, evidently because she liked being there,
and taking advantage of this, Mary addressed her, venturing to give
her the name she had read upon the sign.
 WE are in Derbyshire, are we not, MIrs. Present ?''
e Yes, miss; this is Derbyshire, sure enough.''
 That distance is it from hence to Deep Valley ?'
 WHat, the factory, miss, that is called Deep Valley MIll g
e Yes; how far is it to that factory ?''
e Why it is not over easy to say rightly, seeing that there is no direct
road to it, It is  lonesome out-of-the-way place as ever human
beings thought of taking to, and I can't say as much is knowed about
it by any of the neighbours round. There is a cart-road, I believe, as
goes right down to the mill, but the nearest way would he over them
hills there, of course, because the factory is built down amongst the
very middlemost of 'em,'' replied Mrs. Prescott.
 WOuld the walk over the hills be too far for my, aunt and me2''
inquiced Mary.
Oh dear yes, miss1 I should think so1 Besides, 'is no place
whatever for allies to goto. The poor little return as bids there
bean't no sight for them to look at; and, besides, nobody of any sort
is ever let to look at 'em.''
We must get there, somehow or other, Mrs. Prescott,'' said Mary;
: and I trust in God that we shall not be refused admittance, for our
business is no common one''.
 You have got business at Deep Valley MI1? demanded MIrs.
Prescott, abruptly.
Indeed we have,'' replied MAry, `` and, by some means or other,
we must get in, and, what is more, we must see every apprentice
they have.''
he woman shook her head.
Have had more in one lodging here for a night,'' said she,
: to for some reason or other was curious to get inside of
Deep Valley Mill. But I never knowed one of 'em that ever did
more than get a look down upon it from the top of one of the
mountainous hills out yonder: and it's no easy matter, they
say, to get to the right place even for that; for, by what folks say,
them as built the mills seem to think that they could puzzle the

wicked one himself to find 'em out. But there's one eye as sees
em, if no other do,''
These last words were added in a matter that might, or might not,
be noticed, according to the pleasure of the parties within hearing.
Mary did not notice them.
 Could you have the kindness to tell us to  whom  we should apply
for permission to go through the factory ?'' said she.
`Indeed, miss, I am happy to say knows nothing about 'me, and
if all's true as Ive heard said over the ale-pot by the kitchen fire, the
more people ask for leave, the less they are likely to get it. Bnt may
I make so bold, miss, as to ask the reason why such ladies as you want
to get in there? It would only break your hearts: and what's more,
they've been having a horrid fever there, and that I know for certain,
though they sent the poor little return of by night to be buried, some
to one churchyard, and some to another, to stop people's tongues. It
bean't no place, ladies, for you to go.''
 WHen I tell you why we wish to enter there you willing say so,''
replied MAry. The mill is worked by apprentice children, is it not2'
 Yes, miss, the more's the city--for that's what makes the poor
wretches slaves for life-for not many of 'em, by all accounts, lives till
their time is up.''
t' Hear me then, Mrs. Prescott-among those miserable apprentices we
hope and expect to find a dear child who belongs to us.''
``Lack-a-day s what a story-book that would make a'' exclaimed MIrs.
Prescott.  How long is it since you lost him ?''
It is a long time,'' replied Mary, evading the question, ` and it is
a long story to tell how it happened. He is my own brother-and
this lady who is come with me is our aunt.''
 Are you quite sure, miss, that you shall find him there?''
:How can I say that, Mrs. Prescott, when you tell me so many of
the children are dead ?'' replied Mary. : Bnt so much do I think I
shall, that I will give five sovereigns to any one who will only put me
in the way to get admittance to the mill.''
MIrs. Prescott again shook her head.  There be a man and a many
poor souls round about that would do almost any thing honest for such
a reward; but if any body told you they could do as much, they would
only deceive you, I don't believe there is any body in the parish, not
even the person, could make 'em open their doors to let strangers in.''
Do you think that the person who has the power to open them
would do it for a hundred pounds?'' demanded MIss Brotherton.
`I can't take upon me to say, miss; it sounds like a fortune to me
--but they are all rich at Deep Valley, as folks say, managers, over-
lockers, and all-so, may be they may't think so much of it.''
t Mars. Prescott, I would give five hundred pounds, rather than not
look over the children at Deep Valley MaIl.''
The woman stared at her with a very natural mixture of curiosity
anl astonishment; but there was a friendly interest in her eye, also. ``It's
late to-night, ma'am, to do anything,'' said she, `` and if you'll released
to say nothing to nobody till my husband comes home, I don't know
2A8
rIE LIE AD ADHERES
but what he may be as likely to think upon what would be the best
way to set about it as any body; not that he ever heddles or makes
with the people of the mill in any way, but he's a god schollard, an 
guck-witted man too, as ever I knowed, though I say it as shouldn't.''
This proposal was readily agreed to, and the interval till their host's
return employed in a ramble of a mile or two along the road, where a
recent shower had laid the dust, while every woodbine in the hedges
which skirted it, sent forth a delicious perfume. The outline of the
hills around the, though hardly deserving MIrs. Prescott's epithet of
mountainous, was bold and picturesque, and the foreground, with its
hanging levels and rich across, altogether formed a scene of consider-
able beauty-
 AIR this is very pretty, my good Triplett,'' said Mary, offering he
arm to her old friend to assist her ascent of a steep hill, `` and I should
enjoy it greatly did I not fancy that could we look over yonder hill-
tops we should see a hateful roof, excluding the sweet breath of evening
from the helpless creatures it encloses.''
g tet ye es teh ee or tem roo it, ny dear
child,'' replied the old woman; ` let that thought comfort you.'
 Should I succeed :' cried Mary,`` should I indeed carry home that
little fellow to his poor mother and my pretty Edward, I should
certainly feel something approaching to perfect happiness But if 1
fail . how shall I bear to meet them ?
 Think not of it, deal see how that last bit of sunshine comes full
on your face as you talk about it; that is a sign my dear that you
will have your wish.''
It was the last bit of sunshine, for the next moment the golden disk
was hid behind a ridge of hills; yet they walked on for nearly a mile
further, and, when they returned to the King's Head, they found the
good man of the house already returned, and his puppet, as his wife
assured them, very nearly finished. ` He shall come to you in half
minute, ladies, if you'll please to be state, while I bring in the
candles;-I have told him all you said to me, and we don't seem so
much put out about it, by much, as me,-but he's uncommon 'cute, as
you'll find when you comes to talk to him.''
In about a quarter of an hour Mr. Prescott knocked at the parlour-
look, and being properly introduced to the allies by his wife, was left
standing before them, while she retreated to pursue her various avo-
cations.
 Your wife has told you, Mr, Prescott, our reason for coming here ?''
said Miss Brotherton, glad to escape the repetition of her fictitious
tale.
 She has, a'am,'' was the succinct reply.
:And do you think it possible for us to obtain admission to Deep
Valley M1ill, and to go over it in such a manner as to give us an oppor-
unity of seeing all the children ?'
If I had heard that much, as to your purpose, ladies, and nothing
more, I should have said to, you could nomore get into Deep Valley
factory than into the moon. But my misses added something to the
oP IIOIIAEL ANiStON.
249
back of it, as makes n difference.'' This was said with a look and
accent which fully justified MIrs, Prescott assurances of her good man's
 cuteness.''
I think, Mr. Prescott, that she said no more than I am willing to
make good,'' replied Mary. ''I do not wish to expend money wantonly,
but, if less will not serve, I am ready to give five hundred pounds to
; P-9n who could enable me to see all the children in Deep Valley
Mu
 I is a long sum,miss,'' replied the man thoughtfully, ` and I can't
but fancy that less might serve. The people as is in authority there
is bad people, I don't scruple to say it, and sooner than open their
doors for pity towards any Christian soul, man, woman, or child, they
would see 'em all in the bottomless pit. But 'is just because they do
all the wickedness we heard of, that I see hope they may be bought to
break their own laws; for if they does one thing for the love of gold,
they may do another. Tis plain enough to see, to be sure, that they
know it is for their interest to keep all eyes off their cruel goings-
on-and what's for their interest they won't easily give up.-So it may
be that squire Elwood Sharpton himself would turn away from five
hundred pounds, rather than show off his poor miserable apprentices.-
Bu that many't hold good for his agent, and I believe in my heart that,
if we could quietly get to over Woodcock the manager a hundred
pounds, you would not have long to wait for a sight of the children,''
``And low is this to be done, Mr. Prescott?'' said Miss Brotherton,
if you can undertake to manage it, you may put what price you like
 your services, I feel certain that you would not name a higher sum
than I should be willing to pay.''
 Why, as for me, miss, lI must not be known to meddle or make in
the matter. Squire Sharpton would have my licence, away before I
could say Jack Robinson. Any advice I can give is at your service,
and I may be able to put to up, perhaps, to doing the thing in the
likeliest way; but as to my going to the mill, it won'1 do. One reason
is, that 1 never was there before, and it's like enough that, seeing a
stranger, they'd set the dogs me before I had time to say my errand.
No 1-that won't answer. The only man I can think of as would give
us a chance is one Smith, the miller as serves 'em with oatmeal, and
pretty stuff 'tis, as ve been told, which don't speak over-well for his
honesty, youll say, though, 'is likely the price is in proportion.
HIowsomever, whether he be good or bad, I don't know another as
comes and goes to Deep Valley as he does, and that's what makes
me fix upon him as a messenger,''
``And when could I see this man ?'' demanded Mary.
 WHy, times to-morrow, miss, there's no doubt, if IT goes and
gives him notice,''
Then, do so Mr. Prescott, and be assured your trouble shall not
be forgotten.'
There is no fear of it, miss,'' replied the acute landlord with very
honest sincerity, ``and 1ll go to the mill outright. But I think-
you'll be pleased to excuse me for speaking my mind-that you two
260
TIE LIPE AND ADVENTuRE
ladies must settle between yourselves what you'd be willing to give
timothy Smith himself for the job-seeing that he's not one to work for
nothing;:-and another thing I'd make so free as to mention is, that
you'd do well to make him understand that you don't want to get in-
side their wicked den, but only to see the children, one and all of 'me
--and then you know, miss, they may trim 'em and scour 'em upa
little for shame's sake, afore they brings em out''
Miss Brotherton, after this conversation, felt as fully convinced as
the good wife herself could desire of the value of the landlord's head,
and determined to be guided by his advice. After a little further con-
variation between them, it was settled that she should write a note to
Mr. Woodcock, the manager, in readiness to rise into the hands of
Mr. Timothy Smith on the following morning, if she could prevail upon
him to deliver it
Mr, Prescott performed his part of the business ably, For the portly
miller was waiting for the ladies in the parlour when they returned from
their early walk.
Miss Brotherton possessed a sort of instinctive skill in reading the
human countenance, which rarely deceived her, and it took her not
long to discover that the man she had now to deal with was one upon
whom it would be folly to waste any arguments which did not affect his
own interest. She, therefore, briefly stated the fact that it was of great
importance to her to obtain sight of all the apprentices at Deep Valley
Mill, having great reason to hope that she should find a young relative
there, for whose release from all engagements she was willing to a
handsomely,
 It is not the custom, ma'am, to admit visitors at that factory. It
have been found to hinder the work,'' replied the miller solemnly.
So I understand, sir. But, hearing that you are in the habit of
visiting the mill on business,.I have taken the liberty to send for you
in order to say, that if you would undertake to deliver this note to
Mr. Woodcock, the manager, I would willingly give you five pounds
for your trouble.''
 That is hardly enough, ma'am, for the risk of offending goodman
customer,'' replied the miller.
 WIl couple that sum induce you to do it for me?'' sail MAry.
 On what day do you wish it to reach Mr. Worldcom's hands ?'
demanded Mr. Timothy Smith, endeavouring to retain a doubtful
expression of countcnance.
``Io-day, sir: as early as possible.''
'i,i, i i union with s, na4 rt eo ao t
mince the matter, or deceive you in any way. if you will pay me down
twenty pounds in gold, or Bank of England notes, I will consent to
give up all the important business I had filed to do this morning, and
undertake, not only to give your letter to MIr. Woodcock, but to use
my influence with him--which is greater than you may guess for-to
make him do what you wish, provided that you treat him with the
linearity which a gentleman like him has a right to expect.''
Miss Brotherton edgeworth her pocket-book.
o MICHaEL ArMSTrONG.
2s1
I will give you the twenty pounds you demand, Mr. Smith,'' she
said in a tone as business-like and decided as his own, `` if you perform
my errand successfully. I will give you this ten-pound note now, as pay-
ment for conveying theletter, and another of the same value when you
return to me with the managers permission to see the children who are
apprenticed at the mill.''
Mr. Timothy Smith Looked at MIss Brotherton's pocket-book and he
looked a her. Isis glance at the first inside a strong inclination to
increase his demands; but the miller had studied the human county-
nance as well as the lady, and when he looked at her he felt certain
that though young, rich, and very eager in pursuit of her object, she
was not a fool, and that if he pushed her to a more preposterous pay-
ment than he had already proposed, she would be likely enough to
turn about and look for another agent. He therefore securely replied,
iT is all fair, mama; I agree to the terms.''
And without wasting any further time, the man of the mill received
the note, put on his hat, and departed.
Not all Mary's self-command, and, considering all things, she has
a great deal, could enable her to await the return of her costly lessen-
gcr with composure. All that she heard of this mysterious mill tended
to prove that it was precisely such a place as Sir Matthew Dowling
would be likely to fix upon as the abode of Michael. The more she
meditate the more she became convinced that the boy was there, and
she was hot and cold, pale and red, a dozen times in an hour.
She had kept a copy of her letter to the manager, that she might
show it to MIr. BEll, from whom she hoped to receive absolution for the
innocent fraud she had practised. To ireland re-read this letter, and
to speculate with MIrs. Teletext upon its probable and possible effects,
occupied some portion of the tedious time; slowly dragging her steps
up and down Mrs. Prescott's little garden, and occasionally sitting for
a fidgety five minutes in a power of scarlet-runners, employed the
rest. But the morning seemed endless, and more than once she sus-
pelted that her watch stool still.
The important letter to Mr. Wooilcomb was as follows:
' Sir,-A wealthy and respectable family have recently had reason to
believe that a dear child, long considered as lost, has been sent as an
apprentice to Mlr. Elwood Sharpton's factory at Deep Valley. Fully
aware that the examination necessary to prove whether this hope be
well founded, must be attended with considerable trouble to you-
inasmuch as the children must be brought out from their work for me
to see, l beg to say that, if, without giving me further trouble, you will
permit this, I will pay the sum of one hundred pounds for the adcom-
location. Should it be refused, l must have recourse to other means
for the purpose of ascertaining what it is so important for me to know.
I am, Sir,
 Your obedient servant,
 DonBAs TiEr,''
It was not till five o'clock in the afternoon, by which time Mary
was fully persuaded that her commission had failed, that MIr. Timothy
262
THE LIFE AND ADVENTURES
Smith, in his white hat and well-powdered blue coat, was again seen
approaching the KIng's Head. The heiress, who was sitting near the
window, started up, and would certainly have stepped forward to
meet him, had not Mars. Teletext whispered,  Sit down, Miss Mary,
sit down, there's a darling, and look like a great lady as you did
this morning: and that's what you are, and always should he.'
Mary repeated herself, and, after a short interval, the miller
knocked at the parlour-door, and was desired to enter. Miss Drotherton
pointed to a chair. and he rested himself. e The weather is warm,
ladies,'' said he, drawing forth a cotton handkerchief, and wiping
his head and face, `` and I have not altered in my errand, as you
may see by the state I'm in; but my horse is getting in years, like
his master, and it's no easy work to drive him by such a road as
that I have come by.''
Have you succeeded, sir?'' said Miss Brotherton, looking as
grand as Mrs. Teletext could desire.
I am happy to say, a'am,'' he replied, with dignity, ``tliat the
second ten pounds is fairly won.''
I rejoice to hear it,'' cried Mary, brightly colouring; ``and I shall
have great pleasure in paying it. When, sir, may- I see these child-
aren 7'' she added, pulling ut her pocket-book as she spoke
' Here, ma'am, is Mr. WYoodcomb's reply to yaurnote, and on the
reading of that, I look to hear you say that the ten pounds is mine.'
Miss Brotlerton took the dirty epistle offered her, and real:-
mIRanda,-MIy employer is strict in his orders not to let the hands
be interrupted, as they too often are in some mills, to gratify the idle
curiosity of strangers. But in consideration of your handsome pro-
pedal, and hoping that you won't scruple to follow it with a like sum in
case of your finding and carrying away the child, which will be no
more than just, seeing that if a part with a hand I must get another in
the place of it, on this condition I am willing that all the children on
the premises shall be placed in the feeding-room for your inspection at
twelve o'clock to-morrow.
I am, Madam,
 Your humble servant,
sERIEs WoonconB.''
The miller kept his eye fixed upon her as she read, and the result he
looked for followed the perusal of the despatch he had brought. Miss
Brotherton handed the letter to her friend, and then drew the promised
bank-note from her pocket-book. The jolly miller rose, and received
it from her hands. I thank you, madam,'' said he, folding it care-
fully, `` and I eg to say, in return, that you would have been troubled
to find another man who could have done your erred as well,'
I am quite satisfied, sir,'' she replied, ``and will only ask in
addition to what you have already done for me, that you would be
obliging enough to tell me by what conveyanee it will be best for us to
get to the factory to-morrow? MIr. WVoodcomb, as you probably know,
has named twelve o'clock. I suppose the distance is too great for us
to walk 2'

`QUite impossible, ma'am-altogether out of the question. But I
shall have no objection to hire out my chay-cart for the day, if so be
you would think that suitable,'' said the obliging miller.
1 have no doubt it would do perfectly well, provided you have a
horse that can draw it-I should be sorry to lose time in going, and
should not choose to be later than the hour appointed,'' replied Mary.
 I1l Took to having a fitting horse, ma'am, and one as is used to the
road, and that is what but few are. The road is not very good one in
parts, that's the truth, and I'm not over sure that there's another man
besides myself that would like to undertake the job: but 1'he no
objection to driving you myself, ladies, provided you think it worth
while to pay a tradesman for the loss of his time-of course I can't
charge my labour like a postboy.''
If you take means, sir, to get us to Deep Valley Mill, by the hou
appointed, and drive us back again solely to this house, we shall not
dispute about the price. But remember, if you please, that the
carriage, or cart, or whatever it is, must have accommodation for
the child I hope to bring away with me.'
 I will take care of that, ma'am. I will put a little stool in on
purpose-and I think if 1 say two guineas, ma'am, for the job, which
is no easy one, that you can't-complain of the price.''
I certainly shall not complain of i,'' said Miss Brotherton.
Nine o'clock was then mixed as the hour of setting out, and Mr.
Timothy Smith departed.
Mls. Prescott's roast chicken and French beans were treated very
differently from her previous breakfast and luncheon. Mary Brotherton
was in higher spirits than she had enjoyed for many weeks-she felt
confident of success, and for the festive in her lie, perhaps, fully
enjoyed the possession of the wealth which gave her such power of
surmounting difficulties. The kind-hearted Mrs. Trembley was at
length as sanguine, and almost as happy as herself; and very freely
confessed, again and again, that her dear yong lady knew ten times
better how to manage things than she did, old as she was.
The evening was again spent in a long late ramble, and though they
did not forget that over a certain towering height, pointed out by Mrs.
Prescott, lay the dismal spot called the Deep Valley, the exceeding
happiness which was anticipated for one who dwelt there, male them
almost forget the misery of the rest.

MIr. Timothy Smith was punctual to his appointment, and at a very
few minutes past nine, MIrs. Teletext and Mary were jogging along in
the miller's jockey-cart, on a seat wherein cushions, that looked very
like pillows, had been carefully strapped, and with a little stool placed
before them, the sight of which conjured up so delightful a picture of
the manner in which they should return, and the joy it would be her
lot to confer, and to witness, that the pretty eyes of the heiress
sparkle through tears of pleasure, and she would not have exchanged
her present expedition for the best party of pleasure that ever was
devised by man.
A considerable part of the way was the same as that followed by
MIr. Parsons when he conveyed Michael to the factory, and need not
be again described. The tranquil loneliness of that portion of the
road which ran along the stream, before it made the turn which
brought the hideous prison-house in sight, lulled her spirits into a
state that but ill prepared her for the aspect of the grim, desolate-
looking dwelling into whose recesses she was about to penetrate;
and when it suddenly became visible, something like a groan
escaped her.
I hope that jolt didn't hurt you, ma'am ?'' said the miller, turning
towards her.  Here we are, safe and sound, and that's half my
bargain, at any rate.''
The vehicle drew up to a small door in the exterior wall of the
extensive enclosure in which the buildings stand; MIr, Smith threw the
reins upon the neck of his horse, and bringing his stout person cau-
tedious to the ground, offered his services to assist the two ladies in
doing the same.
Miss Brotherton trembled as she stood waiting till the miller's
summons at the door should be answered. Now that the moment was
come which was to decide the question of her success or failure, she
no longer felt the same confidence which had cheered her while the
trial was still distant, and her heart sunk with anticipated disappoint-
ment. Several minutes of irksome delay gave her time to dwell on
these oppressive forebodings: and when the door was at length slowly
and cautiously opened by Mr, WYoodcomb himself, er pale face spoke
such painful anxiety, that the suspicious guardian of' the unholy spot
was comforted from the satisfactory conviction that her tale was true,
and that she came not under any false pretences to look at that which
he considered it to be the first duty of his life to conceal.

Good morning, Smith-all's right, and all's ready for you. Walk
io, ladies, if you please,'' said the stern manager, relaxing his habitual
frown, and intending to be extremely gracious.
Mary and her friend stepped forward, and heard the stout lock and
two heavy bolts secured behind them.
 This way, ladies, this way, if you please; there is no need to
trouble you to enter the factory, which, do what we will to keep it
nice, can never he quite free from dust. You are a trifle after your
time, Mlr. Smith, but it's no matter; dinner time is over, but if the
allies will walk into this room they shall have all satisfaction. How-
however, as the young uns is again at work, I can't well stop the mills
to march 'em in all together. Nevertheless, I don't see but it may be
quite as agreeable, or may be more, for the ladies to look at 'em one
Or two at a time''
Miss lBrotherton did not attempt to speak, but played herself in a
chair near the open door, and bent her head to indicate that she was
satisfied with the proposed arrangement.
 You had est walk this way with me, Mr. sMith,'' said the ami-
able WVoodcomb, `` the ladies look quite agitated, as is but natural,
and would sooner be without strangers I don't doubt.'' A proposal
which truly was a welcome one to all parties-for MIrs. Teletext and
Mary longed to be at liberty to speak without restraint-Mr. Smith was
thirsting for his accustomed mug of age, and the manager himself
bursting to make a few inquiries respecting his mysterious visitors.
HAve you seen the colour of their money yet, friend Smith?''--.
were the first words uttered as they crossed the court.
 Twenty good pounds,'' replied the miller, expressively patting the
pocket were the treasure lay, ``and given as freely as if it had been
twenty ence-out of a full pocket-book, too, Mr. Woodcock, I can
tell you that-and I can tell you besides, that your money's as sure as
the bank, and your customer one as is thinking of her own concerns
and not of yours.''
 That's what Is judging too, Mr. Smith. One can see in a
minute if folks eyes are roving here and there, up and down, to take
account of all they can see. God grant that those poor whey-faced
females may find what they want, and we shall both of us have made a
good day's work of it. I sha'n't wish the thing talked of, that's a fact,
not but what i shall be ready with an answer, if 1'm trouble with
questions. People as have money to throw about, like these folks,
are not to be put off with a short word, and a lock turned in their faces.
It may't chance once in a century that any such should trouble
themselves concerning the cart-loads of live lumber as we takes off
to relieve the overstocked parishes. But now itis come to pass, in
course we must manage to get through it quietly-so 'm not without
my answer, Mr. Smith, if the squire should hear of it, and make
a riot.''
e No, to be sure you are't-besides there's no need to say nothing,''
replied the killer.
Mr, Woodcock, in answer to this, gave an asserting node, and in

approving smile. : Now then, my man,'' said he, more gaily than he
often uttered any thing, `` sit you down here, and you shall presently
have a snack and a mug to keep you company. 1'Il see myself to the
turning in a few of the hands at a time, to be looked at. For I have
been thinking the matter over, Master Miller, and I judge it will
make ten times less talk and tumult that way, than. if they were all
turned out at once. I'll have out a few boys and girls together,
chance-like, just as they come-and ten to one nobody but Poulet
will find out that there's any thing more going on than some job, as i
want to get done.''
Mr. Woodcock accordingly proceeded to the different parts of the
large establishment, and contrived, without stopping the work and
where, to perform the task he had undertaken. As the selected child-
aren came forth from the various rooms, he told them to cross the
court to the'prentice-house, where they would find one as wanted to
look at them, adding an order to come back again as quick as light,
i they didn't wish to bc strapped dead.
WHenever such promises were made, Mr,. Worldcom was known to
be strictly a man of his word; and Mary and her friend had soon
gazed ith anxious eyes and shuddering hearts upon a greater number
of half-starved trembling little wretches, than could possibly have been
made to pass before them in an equally short space of time, by any
other mode or process whatever.
They came so quickly in succession, however, that no interval was
left in which Miss Brotherton and her faithful attendant could exchange
a word on the melancholy panorama of human misery that passed be-
for them. Strange and unwanted as was the spectacle of `` two ladies
sitting in the 'prentice-house,'' the cover and frightened children, for
the most part did little more than stand before her with eyes ad
mouth wide open for a single minute, and then start off again, while
Mary herself aided the celebrity of the process by a share of the head,
and a way of the hand, which indicated plainly enough that they
were not to stay, but ge.

spirits worn with repeated disappointments, and thecontemplation of
the wretched creatures for whom she knew she brought no help.
 he train seems endless1''
The old woman returned her a speaking look, and whispered in her
ear-'` Could you not question them, wary? light not this dismal
work be shortened by your asking them if the boy is here? They
can't have any reason to hide him. They can't be agents of Sir
MAtthew,'
Mary took the hint, and said to the next young skeleton that pre-
seated itself- Can you tell me if there is a boy here named Michael
Armstrong'
The result was a stupid and silent stare, and, without answering, the
child darted off like the rest. Thrice she repeated the question, but
with no better success, for two out of the three were among those newly
arrived to supply vacancies caused by the late mortality, and the third
of 3ISRAEL ARMSTRONG.
257
from working and sleeping in another chamber, had never heard poor
Michael's name.  No:'' was pronounced by this one, `` No, ma'am,''
by the two new comers, and Mary's heart almost failing her, she re-.
sued her silent examination. In truth there was in most of the
happy faces that has presented themselves, such a look of blighted
intellect, and dogged apathy, that she clung to the ever-lessening hope
of using the boy appear, in preference to any further questioning.-
And thus the coming and going lasted for another half-hour without a
word being spoken.
At length the sad monotony of the spectacle was broken, at least to
the eyes of Mary, by the appearance of a little girl, who though pale
and lamentable thin, had not yet lost thereby the sweet expression of
her delicate features, neither had the soul within yielded to the para-
lying influence of the hopeless, helpless, unvarying misery by which
she was surrounded. Her soft gray eyes still retained their eloquent
power of speaking, and the look of surprise, mixed with something
that was almost approaching to pleasure, with which she fixed them
upon MAry's face caused her to make a sudden movement to detain
her, as the child, following the example of the rest, was turning away.
At first this movement was caused entirely by the interest which the
little creature herself inspired-but it almost immediately occurred to
her, that here, at length, there was a chance of receiving a rational
and intelligent answer to any question she might ask:  and such
strength did this idea gain as she continued to look at the child, that
she told MIrs. Strelet to stop the approach of those who were coming
on, and by keeping them waiting in the court for a minute or two, to6
give her time to see if she could not learn something from this most
interesting-looking little creature. MIrs, Teletext showed that she toa
thought something might now be hoped for, and with great alacerity
stepped out into the court to meet the fresh arrivals, shutting, to
MAry's extreme satisfaction, the door of the room behind her.
 MIy dear little girl'' said Miss Brotherton, taking the child's pale
and slender hand in her, `` How came you in this sad place? You
do not look as if you were used to it.''
nOt for very long, ma'man,'' was the reply.
 But you have been here during the few last weeks 2''
t I have been here for several months,'' answered the little girl.
Can you tell me''-and MAry almost gasped as she asked the
question-': Can you tell me, if there be a boy here called Michael
Armstrong ?''
The look of modest and well-pleased curiosity with which the soft
eye were fixed on Mary's face, was instantly changed or an expression
of deep anguish--for a few moments no reply was uttered, and large
tears were already chasing each other down her cheeks before the term-
bling child found voice to speak; at last she uttered, almost in a this-
per, and still looking through her tears in Mary's face-' Michael Arm-
strong is dead ''
 Dead:-Oh, do not say sol'' cried Mary, in a voice so shrill cs

paleness spread itself over her face and lips, she seemed choking, and
perfectly unable to articulate, but clasping her hands together, and
dropping on her knees before Miss Brotherton, raised her eloquent eyes
to her face with a look which required no commentary.
Open the door, NIrs. Triplett '' said Mary. `` Don't you hear
the knocking? This is the child I shall take away with me,'' she
added in a whisper, and with a look that her friend perfectly under-
stood.
MIrs. Teletext opened the door, and the well-pleased Mr. Wool-
comb stood before them.
 That's well,'' he said, looking at the kneeling child, and at Mary,
whose arm encircled her neck, with an air of great complacent. I
thought by what those said, as you sent back without looking at 'me,
that you had found what you wanted. And now, ladies, I hope to
remember the conditions.''
Do not doubt it, sir,'' replied Miss Brotherton, instantly drawing
forth her pocket-book. here is a note of one hundred pounds to repay
the trouble I have given you, and here, a second of the same value
to atone for the loss of Fanny's labour.''
All right, ma'am,'' said Mr. Woodcock, very graciously, ``and if
you had but told me that it was a little girl, with a very pretty face,
and that her name was Fanny, I could have saved you all your trouble,
for we don't happen to have another that would answer to that
description.'
Have taken no trouble, sir, that at all regret,'' replied Miss
Brotherton, `` but I am anxious to set off on my return without any
farther loss of time. WIll you have the kindness to inquire if Mr,
Smith is ready ?'
I don't doubt, ma'am. but he will be ready to obey orders, though
the horse have hardly been baited well yet. Howsomever, those as
pay well generally looks to have things done in a little less time than
other folks; and it's very right and fair that so it should be. If a horse
can stand, he ought to go, if his owner is well paid-there is no doubt
of t,'
I should be sorry to distress the horse,'' said Mary, ` and if he
be not sufficiently rested, we must wait''
At your pleasure, ladies, at your pleasure. Pray sit down and
make yourselves comfortable. And of course your ladyship would like
to have this pretty little girl here made as decent as we can manage:
the dirtiest part of her clothes can be changed easy, though the misses
of the 'prentice-house being lately dead, pts us out a little in our
management. However, if little Miss Fanny, as we must call her now,
will please to come up stairs with me, i can make her look a deal
better, I will answer for it.''
Fanny Fletcher having been raised from her kneeling position by
the hand of Miss Brotherton, still continued to hold that hand tightly,
and the young lady now felt so strong a compression of her fingers,
and was at the same time conscious of so tremulous a movement in
s2

TEE LFE AND ADVeNTURE
the person of the child, as she nestled closely to her, that she felt
persuaded the proposal of Mr. Woodcock had frightened her.
You are very kind,'' she replied, drawing the child, solid as its
wretched garments were, still closer to her, ``you are very kind, sir.
But 1 shall prefer taking her away, exactly as I first looked upon
her.''
 Dear mel only to think of that now1 That's the beauty of what's
called natural affecting1 Then if you will please to keep seated Ill
go tell Miller Smith as you're ready, and all the business done, so as
he may set off as soon as he is able,''
Mary again thanked him for his civility, but felt disposed to think
that he might have executed his mission more satisfactorily, when he
returned in about three minutes, with the assurance that Master Smith
would be ready to start in little less than an hour.
An hour at that moment seemed to Miss Brotherton an almost in-
terminal space of time; she felt painfully conscious of being,
` confined and pent up'' with sin and suffering. Heated, agitated,
and impatient-panting for the fresh air, and longing to question her
little purchased protegee, concerning poor Michael, she determined to
walk forward on the road they had that morning traversed, and letting
Mr. Smith and his cart overtake them.
Should yu dislike walking on, Mrs. Teletext2'' she said.  My
head aches, and 1 am sure nothing will relieve me but a walk,''
:I should like it to, my dear,'' replied her observant com-
anion, looking anxiously in her face, and perfectly understanding her
feelings.
 WAlk, ladies I'' exclaimed Mr. WVoolcomb, looking exceedingly
shocked, ` allies such as you to walk out upon our wild moors? Oh
dearno1 That is quite impossible:'
. This was said to prove at once his tender care of personages possess-
in the power of dispensing hundreds, and to show that he was not
unacquainted with the refinements of polite society; but this civilly-in.
tended opposition to their exit produced on his hearers an effect very
different from what he intended.
That Fanny Fletcher should tremble at the mention of delay was
not extraordinary, but that Mary should hear again, in fancy, the
grating sound of the locks and bars, which had closed behind her as
she entered, and feel a sick qualm at her heart, as if she were be-
traced, and doomed to remain in that hateful spot against her will,
showed that her nerves had indeed been severely shaken, and that her
heroism had more of zeal than strength in it.
Mrs. Teletext, too, looked exceedingly annoyed, though certainly
without the same lively recollection of the bolts and bars; but she
was so accustomed to consult the wishes of her young companion, and
to feel at ease herself only when she saw her so, that she too coloured
with impatience, and sustaining amicably her character of aunt, said,
`1 beg pardon, sir, but I know my niece's constitution so well, that I
am quite sure the jolting of that rough cart would not do for her just

261
at present. She is a great walker, an a mile or so, creeping along
in the fresh air, will do her a deal of good,''
`In course you know best, ladies, and I can't, for certain, take the
liberty to oppose. But, by your leave, I'll just mention your plan to
Mr. Smith before you start, and then, maybe he'll be for pushing on
his horse a little,''
o saying, Mr. Woodcock left them; when MAry, turning to the
little girl, said,  Have you any bonnet and shawl to put on, Fanny ?''
1 don't know,'' replied the child.
 Not knaw? How can that be, Fauna ?''
 Because I have never been out of the doors since I first came
into them,'' said Fanny.
 Poor denr: I wish they would not keep you here any longer-
this is quite intolerable I'' said Mary, again opening the door, and
looking impatiently across the dismal court.
 Keep me here?'' murmured the little girl, in a voice of the most
evident terror. ` Do you think they will keep me here ?'
No, no, my poor child, they shall not keep you more,'' said Mrs.
Teletext, kindly.  Hure come the two men together.''
Fanny did not venture to look at them, but Mary did: and again, in
spite of her reason, she felt terrified at the idea that she was in their
power. MIr. WVoodcomb, indeed, looked smiling and obsequious as
before, but in the countenance of the burly miller there was something
of opposition and displeasure that she could not understand.
Setting of walking, miss, is very like billing your driver,'' said
he, with considerably more bluntness than civility.
 la1 does he mean, Mrs. Temlett?'' said MAry, turing pale.
You had better pay the gentleman before you set out, my dear.
That's what you mean to say, isn't it, sir ?''
Why surely, mama, it would be more like doing business'' replied
the man, looking a lille ashamed of himself.
Is that all?'' sid Mary, inexpressibly relieved, and drawing out
her ready purse with such cheerful alacrity, that could the hearts of
the two men before whom she stood have been read, there might
have been found in both a strong inclination to profit by it a little
further.
That, I think, sir, is the sum you name for the fire of your
vehicle ?'' said Mary, extending her hand with two sovereigns towards
him.
MIr. Timothy Smith took the money, but certainly thought that if
that sharp-eyed rogue Woodcock had been further he might have hit
upon some excuse for demanding more. As it was, however, he could
not endure it, and with a rather surly inclination of the head,
pocketed the gold, and left the room.
Now then, sir, if you please,'' said the still frightened Mary, `` we
will wish you good morning.''
Yes, ma'am, surely, you can go if you please. Only perhaps you
might like, for the honour of your oung relation here, to leave some little
gratuity to be divided as a little treat among her late companions?''
26a
TO LIE AND ADdRESS
Mary looked in his face, and the sort of half-ashamed glance with
which the extortion watched the effect of his work, appeared to her
so sinister, that with a sudden feeling of something like rational alarm,
she remembered that she had only a few shillings left in her purse, and
that again to open in his presence her still well-filled pocket-book,
might be dangerous.
Aunt Teletext, have you any money to lend me2'' she said, at
the same time drawing out again her almost empty purse. I am
very sorry I have only these few shillings left; but I will willingly
send you five pounds, sir, for the purpose you mention, if the miller
will take the trouble of bringing it to you.''
Oh1 It's no matter, ladies. Pray do not trouble yourselves
any more about it,'' replied Woolcomb, keeping his eyes, however,
furtively directed towards Mrs, Teletext, who was still engaged in
seeking for money in the recesses of a very large pocket.
I have two pounds and a few shillings, my dear,'' said the old
lady, at length placing her little leather purse in Mary's hand.
 That will do, that will do perfectly,'' said the worshipper of
Mammon, with an air and one of the most amiable liberality, but at
the same time stretching out his hand, in which he received the entire
contents, uncounted, of Mrs, Teletext's purse, which Miss Brotherton
unleashed, anl emptied into it.
Had she studied the man's character for years, she could not have
devised any maneuver so likely to hasten the unlocking the door
which enclosed them as thus emptying their two purses before his
eyes. He now moved forward of his own accord, drew forth from the
pocket of his coat the massive key, applied it with a large, strong, and
effective and, to the enormous lock, drew back the heavy bolts, and
finally threw wide the hateful door.
The three females passed through it with no lingering steps, and
hear it close heavily behind them, with feelings assuredly very if-
ferent in degree, but in so far the same, that each one as she stepped
over the threshold, breathed a prayer that she might never repass it
again.

are happy enough to feel that they are quitting those hideous walls for
ever, it can hardly fail to convey a sense of beauty, freshness, and
freedom, sufficient to expand the heart with admiration and delight.
Mary felt disposed to found along the grassy path side the stream
with the joyous playfulness of a child, and rather than have re-entered
that creaking door again, would have been tempted, like another Un-
dine, to plunge into the water, and take her chance of finding quarters
less hateful beneath its rippling wave. Mrs. Teletext breathed more
freely, and seemed to have recovered the elastic step of youth, as she
moved briskly on. lut compared with what was passing in the breast
of the ragged, dirty little creature that walked beside them, their
feelings were most earthly cold and dull. Her small and was still
clasped in that of Miss Brotherton, who felt that the child was urging
her onward, even faster than she was inclined to go, while her head
upturned towards the towering heights which hemmed them in,
seemed eagerly seeking an outlet from the region that her soul ab-
horned.
 ou are flat, denr Fanny, are you not, to know that you have
left that frightlul place?'' said Mary, kindly pressing the little emacs-
aged hand she held in hers. The child stopped short in her hurried
walk, and looking up in her deliverer's face, with a doubting anxious
look that it was painful to see, murmured very softly, and as if fearing
to be overheard from within the walls,
Shall I never, never go back again ?''
 No, never Fanny  Do you think I would be so cruel as to take
you baek ?2'' said Mary.
I do not know if it is not all a dream,'' replied the child. I1
have dreamed that I saw green grass, and felt the air upon my face,
before.''
 Do not be afraid, Fanny You are not dreaming now,'' returned
Mary. `" Run on, and gather that fine large stalk of foxglove. You
never saw such a gay flower as that in your dreams, did you ?''
The little girl sprang forward, and falling upon her knees on the
grass, plucked the tall flower, and pressed it to her lips, and to her
heart. But though this was a childish action, it was not done child-
ishly: there was an appearance of deep feeling, and even of devotion
in her look and attitude which strongly awakened MAry's interest, and
when the little creature rose again, and holding the flower in one hand,
said the other once more into that of her new friend, the heart of that
friend yearned towards her with newly-awakened tenderness. But
when she spoke to her, and endeavoured to lead her into conversation,
the attempt entirely failed. There are many who might have felt
disappointed and chilled by this; but MAry Drotherton had truer sym-
cathy, and as, from time to time, she felt a loving contraction of
Fanny's little finger upon her own, and sometimes caught her looking
up, as if by stealth into her face, she felt no misgivings as to the cause
of her silence, but loved her the better from knowing that her heart
was too full to speak.
They all, and as if moved by one common impulse, walker quickly

THE LIFE AND DVsNTUnES
forward as long as their road continued along the margin of the
stream; but when it turned round the steep hill's base, and began to
mount, their pace relaxed, Mary felt that her lille companion dragged
on her steps with Labour, and perceived that Mrs. Trembley was out of
breath.
Let us sit down under this ash-tree, and wait for the jolly miller,''
said Miss Brotherton, '`it cannot be very long, I think, before ha
overtakes us.''
This proposal was the more amiable, because, in the first place,
MAry could herself have run from the bottom of that steep hill to the
top, almost without perceiving that it was any hill at all:; and in the
next, she so exceedingly disliked both the miller and his cart, that
had she consulted her own inclinations alone, she would probably
have preferred retracing the whole way on foot.
But very gladly was her proposal for rest accepted, by both her old
and young companion, and long did they remain seated under their
pleasant canopy before they any of them grew weary of it; till at
length, after consulting her watch, Miss Brotherton expressed a doubt
whether the fat miller and his lazy steed intended to overtake them at
all.
Good gracious, my dear do you really think so?'' said MIrs.
Teletext, considerably alarmed. e WII, Mary, we shall never get
back to Mrs. Prescott's without in 
I hope I may be mistaken, my year old woman,'' said her kind
mistress, affectionately; ` for I fear such a walk would be too much
for you. But when I remember that he is paid, and remember, like-
wise, how very little he seemed actuated by any motive, save that of
sordid interest, I confess that I do think it very probable he means to
leave us in the lurch,''
Then let us walk on, Miss Mary, without saying a word more
about it. The shadows are beginning to grow long already, and you
shan't be kept out half the night by my laziness. Come along, little
gil.'
With these words, MIrs. Teletext raised herself from between two
comfortable roots, which had made her an excellent arm-chair; but
the little girl whom she summoned to do likewise, though she exerted
herself to get on her feet, seemed hardly able to stand.
Miy poor Fanny, you are quite knocked up:'' exclaimed MIss
Brotherton, looking at her with great anxiety.  How in the world
shall we ever be able to get her, on 1''
 It is only because I have not been used to walk lately,'' said
Fanny; '` that is, not as we have been walking now. Our work keeps
us always on our left, and that makes them bend about so, when I
try to walk; but I can walk though it hurts me, and I think it would
be better to die outright in getting on, rather than rest. so near the
factory-so, please ma'am, I quite ready to go on.''
And again the party set off, but the difficulty with which the little
Fanny got along became more obvious at every step, and it soon be-
came evident that to get as far as Mrs. Prescott's would be impossible.
or MIICIIAEL ARMSTrONG.
265
The dilemma was not a pleasantone. They were still in a part of the
road so little frequented, that it was probable they might wait for
hours without obtaining assistance from any passer by, nor did either
Mars. Teletext or Mary recollect to have seen any dwelling nearer
than the high-rond, from which they were still at a considerable dis-
dance.
The distress of the little girl was painful to witness. At the very
moment when the dark cloud which had seemed to settle upon her
was withdrawn, and hope gradually and with difficulty, as to eyes long
unaccustomed to its light, began to reach her; at that very moment het
strength failed, and a sensation, like the sickness of death, rendered
every attempt at further exertion impossible.
``1 must stay here,'' she said; ` it is the will of God.''
No, no, Fanny,'' said Miss IBrotherton, seating herself beside her,
and letting the languid lille head rop upon her bosom; `` you have
no reason to think that, while I have a thousand to believe the con-
tracy. It is a most strange chance which has brought me here, and
places you in my hands-this was by the will of God, and I will not
believe it has so chanced, only that I may see on die.''
 You must not stay here,'' said Fanny, feebly; ` night will come
presently, and you must go fast to get home. Do not be sorry for me
-but, indeed, I think I am as bad as Michael was, when he fell sick,
and was carried away to die.''
Did you see-'' began Mary, eagerly ; but suddenly stopping herself,
she added, ` Not now my poor Fanny, you must not tell me about it
now-when I have got you strong and wellat my own home, we will talk
of poor MIchael. Try not, to think how glad you will be when we have
got you home, and all our difficulties are overt But something must
be done, l know, a poor child, before this can be. How had we
best act in this dilemma, Mrs, Teletext? Do you think you shall have
courage to remain with this poor child while I run on, and endeavour
to find some house where we may get assistance?''
 Alone, Miss Mary ?'' replied the good woman, looking terribly
alarmed.  How can t let you set off in a strange, wild country like
this, with nobody to take care of you? Let us go together, Mary;
nothing can hurt this little girl, you know, while we are away.''
 Think it or once more, dear Triplett,'' said Mary, ``and then
I believe you will receive that there is more chance of your being use-
ful to her, than to me. I shall get on faster without you, good nurse,
and with a lighter heart than if I took you for company, while this
little creature was left with nothing but her own melancholy thoughts
and childish terrors to comfort her.'
Then I will stay,'' said the poor woman, sighing heavily: `but
just think, MIss Mary, how I shall feel till you come back again'
I will not loiter to amuse myself,'' replied her young mistress with
a cheering smile; ``and now take my place, and let this poor little
heat rest on your shoulder,'
She shall lie down on that bit of level turf yonder, with her head

Glad to find that her unexpected companion in this most desolate
spot, was of the safer, because the maker portion of the human race,
the wandering heiress determined to address her; but deemed it
wisest to approach her visibly, instead of starting the poor soul by
speaking to her unexpectedly from the spot where she stood. For this
purpose, she gently descended from her elevation, and making a little
circuit, presented herself before the eyes of the sun-gazer.
The old woman, for such she was, sat nose and knees together, in a
sort of hole which completely sheltered her in every direction but the
west; and from the earnest manner in which her dim eyes were fixed
on the last bright rays of the setting sun, it seemed as if her lair was
chosen on purpose to look upon it.
The appearance of Mary seemed to startle her, but not much;: for
after looking at her for a minute as if she examined her person with
difficulty, because her eyes were dazzled by the object on which she
had before been gaming, she said, pointing a stick that she held
towards the point whence the bright orb had just disappeared,
 who be you, coming to spy out old Sally at her devotions?''
I want to find a house, my good woman, for I have left a poor
child very ill at a short distance from hence; I want to find people
who can help me to remove her''
There are no people here,'' said the old woman, in a gentle but
melancholy voice, and turning her eyes round the desolate moor as if
in confirmation of the assertion.
``ut perhaps you may be able to tell me where I can find some
one ?'
O dear1 O denr1 there is no want of finding for such as you.
Just g upon the high-road in turn yourself about, and say,`Come
to me,' and you'll be seeing em flock in, right and left, and north and
south, all bowing and scraping as genteel as possible. 'Tis only me
as lives in a hole, and prays to the sun every night to be so kind as
not to make me the next morning: 'is only me that never sees any
boy. I am the only woman in all the world-all the rest have got
their death in the factories.''
There are many circumstances of more danger, that are infinitely
less appalling than meeting, when out of sight of every other human
being, a poor frail shattered remnant of humanity with a disordered
wit. Mary shuttered as the wild speech of this poor creature con-
firmed the idea of insanity which her appearance suggested, and her
first impulse was to turn and run. But her steps were stayed by the
shell, tircabling voice of the old woman., who in an accent, the most
helpless and forlorn, called after her,
 One minute-only stay one minute Let me look at you one
minute 1''
MAry turned again, and all feeling of terror was lost in pity as she
beheld the miserable little crippled figure which was hobbling towards
her. Her height hardly reached that of an ordinary child of tele
years old, her gait showed that her legs were dreadfully deformed, her
uncouth garments hung about her in tatters, and as she painfully
268
THE LIFE AND  ADVENTURES
rolled herself at every step round the stick by whose aid she was sup-
porter, it was hardly possible to conceive a more complete image of
poverty and decrepitude, than her whole appearance offered.
 Do not hurry so'' cried Mary, every idea of alarm lost in con-
attempting her suffering helplessness.  I will not go yet, if you wish
me to stay.'' They were now close together, and the shaking creature
looked up in her face, with a soft, silly smile, that had all the woful
innocence of liability. WIth a small, skinny and that was deli-
lately pale, and perfectly clean, she took the end of Mary 's silk scarface
gazed upon it in sort of ecstasy. `` Oh, fine  oh, pretty, pretty, pretty ?''
she exclaimed, smoothing and putting it with her hand, as fit had been
a time and favourite bird. `` I think,'' she added, with a sagacious nod,
that I know where you come from. This just the things, I know, that
they wear in heaven-I think i know where you come from.'' Then
breaking into what sounded like a genuine laugh, she again repeated,
1 think I know where you come from-that is what the overlooked
man said to me,'' she added, lowering her voice to a whisper, ``when
he caught me running away from the factory. It is not so very longage
--I can tell you all about it, if you would like to her-and it is not like
the rest of the things you know,'' touching her forehead with her for-
finger;`` I don't tell that backwards and forwards, nonsense-fashion,
like the other things I talk about-that was beat in upon my brain by
the blacksmith, and nothing can ever take it out again, they say, till
one of the angels does it in heaven. It used to pain me a good
deal,'' she continued, taking off her hat, and laying her open palm on
the top of her head, ` but since I took to sitting on my throne there,
as the folks call it, and gathered the dew morning and night to put
upon it, the pain is a deal better.''
tI cannot hear for astorino,'' said Mary, gently, `` because there
is a pair sick girl on the side of the hill that wants me very bad-she
comes from the factory too, and she is too ill to walk-can you tell me
where I can find any body to help me carry her?''
`` Come from the factory, is she? Denr, dear, der, dear: She
will be sure to die, you may depend on it-they all do die, except
me. Don't you fancy that you'll ever take her hack alive, it was only
IN that could bear that, and I was but in the head for it, as I told
you.''
 I do not want to take her back,'' said MAry,  I want to help
her. Where do you live Are there any houses or people near this
place? Now, be a good woman, and take me where i can find some-
body to help us.''
ees, I will,'' replied the poor creature, in a tone which convinced
Miss Broatherton that she understood her, and at the same time be-
ginning to hobble on before her towards the road.
Nothing probably less pressing, and less hopeless than her present
position could have tempted Mary to trust herself to such a guide:
yet she felt a strange sort of confidence that the old woman knew what
she was about, and though aware that the experiment was rather a

269
desperate one, determined to follow wherever her feeble guide should
lead, certain, at least, that the distance could not be very great-
There was, however, much more strength and power of locomotion
in the little cripple than she gave her credit for. Having contrived to
crawl through the grassy dyke that fenced the moor, she crossed the
road obliquely, and making her way through a very imperfect hedge
of fuze and quickest, hobbled on across a bit of miserably arid stub-
ble, which presently descended abruptly, and led to a tuft of stunted
older-bushes, beside which stood a small farm-house, with its cow-yard,
barns, and ricks.'
Surprise and delighted to find herself so near a human dwelling,
MAry had hardly patience to restrain her steps to the pace of her post
guide, nevertheless she had not the heart to leave her, for there was an
expression of pride and pleasure in the woman's eye as she turned
round from time to time as they advanced, which she felt it would be
most cruel to check by showing that she could do without her. So
it was together that they reached the bottom of the steep descent, and
together that they entered the kitchen of the farm-house, where a very
decent-looking, middle-aged woman was engaged in preparing sup-
per. She looked exceedingly surprised at the appearance of Miss
Brotherton, and for a moment turned her eyes from her to hier com-
anion, and back again, with an air that was almost bewildered; but
soon recovering herself she courtesies with much respect, and said,  1
hope you haven't been scared, ma'am, by falling in with this poor
cretur? She is as harmless as a baby.''
Oh, no1'' replied Mary,' she has been very kind to me, for who
has brought e here, where I should never have been able to get with-
out her, the house is so completely concealed-and I want help, ma'am,
very much indeed.''
 You haven't met no accident, I hope ?'' said the good woman,
kindly, and ceasing her notable operations, she drew forward a wooden
chair for her guest to sit upon.
Thank you very much,'' said the young lady, seating herself.
e Yet it is not rest I most want. I have a little girl with me whom I
have left by the side of the road that locals from the mills; she is too
weak and ill to get on, and I hope you will be able to lend me some
conveyance-a cart, a raggn, any thing to take her as far as the
King's Head, three or four miles I oppose from hence, upon the turn-
pike-road: I would pay well for it.''
From the mill ?'' repeated the woman staring
Yes; from the place called Deep Valley Mill,'' replied Mary,
`` perhaps rather more than a mile from here.''
Oh! ma'am, I know the Deep Valley Mill well enough,'' was the
answer. : ALl M, Worldcom's own butter and milk comes from
here. That is not the difficult. Bat we shaft like to have nothing
to do with carrying away any child from there.''
 You neck fear nothing on that point,'' replied Miss Brotherton,
eagerly, `` I have paid for permission to bring this child away.''
 That alters the case for certain. bUt-I ask your pardon, malm,
270
THE LIFE AND ADVENTURES
--there is something very odd too, in such a lady as you walking
away from the factory with one of the children.''
e Indeed I do not wonder at for saying so. But believe me, I
tell you nothing but the truth when I assure you that I have permits-
sion, and have paid largely for it, to bring this child away. Our un-
fortunately attempting to walk was merely accident, and occasioned
entirely by my foolish impatience to get away from the place before
Mr. Smith, the miller, who took me there, thought his horse sufficiently
rested to return.''
MIr. Smith, the miller2 Then for certain all's right-for they be
known for the greatest of friends, MIr, Woodcock and he-and I dare
say my husband, ma'am, would be proud to help you when he comes
home. It's coming dark fast, and he won't be long I dare say.''
 But I must go back to this poor child; I have left her with an
old lady, who will, I fear, be greatly alarmed at being left so long,''
said Mary.
t Poor held'' repeated her limping guide, who, from the moment
they had entered, had been reposing herself, by sitting on the floor,
and had not spoken till now.,  Poor child -think of that s-and
she comes from the factory1 Think of speaking in that way of a
factory child t''
 Hold your tongue, Sally, or I'll give you no porridge for supper,''
said the woman, but by no means harshly; and as she spoke, she drop-
ped into the maniac's lap a piece of bread that lay in a plate upon the
table.
:Had your factory child got this now,'' said poor Sally, nodding
her head with a sort of boastful exaltation, ``she would not be so
terrible bad. But there's nobody but me as gets this. I am the only
old woman in the world; all the rest die young-and most of 'em,''
she added, in a whisper, `` before they get away.''
 Was this poor creature at the Deep Valley factory when she was
young ?'' demanded Miss Brotherton.
She tells you quite true, ma'am,'' replied the farmer's wife, re-
suing her cookery, which consisted in chopping up bacon, cabbage,
and potatoes, for the frying-pan. : She talks nonsense about the
moon sometimes, and is very wild when it comes to the full, but she
never makes any blunder when she tells of her own troubles at the
factory. She neer varies the least bit in the world when she tells
about her getting away, and being stopped, and taken back again,
poor cretur. 'Tis only too true, that's the worst of it-and she has
never been in her right mind since.''
I would hear her tell it willingly, and should listen to it with great
interest,'' said MIss Brotherton.  But at this moment I can think of
nothing but those I have left,''
 Whereabouts be they, ma'am ?'' demanded the farmer's wife.
MIndy described the spot very accurately.  Why, dear mel them
surely must be the trees right against or gate,'' said the good woman,
with great apparent satisfaction. ` And if so be as 1a right, 'is
hardly more than a stone's throw from our back gate. I take it,

come,''
 In that case,'' replied Miss DBrotherton, greatly comforted, I have
no doubt that we could get the poor little girl here, and then if you
would give us leave to remain till your husband has contrived to procure
some sort of conveyance for s, all our troubles would be over, and
most gratefully will I repay you for your assistance.''
ee I will show you the way this moment, ma'am,'' said the woman,
with great alacrity; and once more suspending her labours for the
good man's super, she prepared to attend the lady by taking off an
external apron, and smoothing that which was below it.
Though not quite within a stone's throw, the spot to which Miss
Brotherton was so anxious to return, was reached by a very short cut
across the piece of meadow-ground on which the back part of the
farm-house opened.
The joy of Mrs. Tremble at seeing her was great indeed: and poor
Fanny, refreshed by the interval of rest, declared herself quite able to
walk ` a good piece more,''
 Poor little creature .'' exclaimed good Mrs. Roberts, the farmer's
with; `` she do look bad, sure enough It is seldom however that he
gets a sight of the children at the mill, for they sends regular for what
they want, and bean't over fond of having any body go near 'em;-
but she puts me strongly in mind of old Sally's stories to be sure I1'
The little party reached the farm without difficulty, and then, indeed,
as Mary had predicted, all their present troubles seemed over, for
nothing could exceed the earnest kindness with which Mrs. Roberts
administered to all their wants. Mrs. Teletext's appearance and
manner appeared to have entirely remove the sort of doubtful im-
pression which poor Mary's hurried entree had produced, and having
been told that the little girl had been reclaimed by them as a relation,
the whole adventure appeared to her as one of the deepest interest,
in her sympathy and good-will were most fully excited.
Old Sally was sitting upon the floor exactly where they had left her.
 Poor thing l'' exclaimed Mary, ' she has not moved an inch.''
 Not the, poor soul,'' replied Mrs. Roberts,  ' I told her to bide
still, and when he says that to her, she'd keep still, if he was to
be away s whole day, I believe. Get up, Sally'' she added, gao-
humouredly.  There's a brave woman Look at that little girl, and
tell the allies what she puts you in mind of.''
The expression of the poor withered, idiot fact, that was turned upon
Fanny Fletcher when this was uttered, was most touching sad and
solemn. The gentle, silly look, which her countenance usually wore,
was exchanged For one full of deep mysterious meaning. She drew
herself towards the little girl with a sort of stealthy movement, as if
afraid of being seen to approach her, and when quite close beside her,
said,
 of then have done as I did-you have run away? Poor poe

THE LIFE AND ADVENTURES
little thing. Can't you guess what will come next ? Poor little thing'
They will catch you1 hide where you will, they will catch you.''
2I have not run away,'' said Fanny, gently.
The maniac shook her head. ` Don't you scream as I did, my poor
lamb, for it's no good; they are no more for screams and groans
than for the whirring of the spindles. But the screams went into my
own ears, and I have never got rid of them since. I still hear them,
all night long, when it is moon-time. Poor, poor little girl :''
'Come, come Sally-let her alone now, she is going to eat some-
thing-''
And Mrs. Roberts completed the arrangements upon which she had
been occupied since they entered, by placing chairs at the table on
which bread, butter, and cheese, were placed.
Not even did the Deep-Valley apprentice feel more disposed to do
justice to these preparations than did Miss Brotherton and her old
servant. They had tasted nothing since breakfast, and when a bowl
of fresh milk was added to the bread-and-butter, MAry gratefully
assured her entertainer that she considered it as the most delicious
supper she had ever eaten,
Now that's different,'' said poor Sally, who had perched herself on
a low stool close to Fanny Fletcher.` I never had any pretty creature
like that, all clothed in heavenly trappings, giving e milk; but it
will make no difference in the end-you must be dragged back again,
poor little thing:''
No, no-she won't he dragged back again,'' said Mrs. Roberts;
`and there's a cup of milk for you-so now let the ladies eat in
peace, Sally. You know it's time for you to be crawling home-the
master will be here in no time, and maybe he will be after asking how
many stones you have picked up.to-day, so you had better be off,''
The docile creature immediately shuffled off her stool, and prepared
to depart.
I should like to hear her describe her own adventures, which you
say she does so faithfully,'' said Miss Brotherton.  Do you think
you could persuade her to repeat her story to us 2''
Yes, yes, mama; she will do that quick enough; it is just what
she likes best,'' replied Mrs. Roberts; ``exccptnow and then when
she is moody. Now, Sally, if you will behave yourself like a sensible
woman, yo may sit down again, and tell the ladies how you ran
away from the mill, and was caught and brought back again, and all
the rest of it,:'
The little cripple's eyes twinkle, and a gleam of intelligence
flashed across her countenance with a sort of Will.o'-the-wisp bright-
ness, as she took the fragment of a hat from her closely-shorn gray
head, and repeated herself.
`Twas my knees as was the first of it,'' she began; '`I couldn't
bear it. The pain grower worse and worse, and my legs dipped
down, and they strapped me harder and harder, and that was the
reason that I couldn't bear it. So one day,'' she continued, in a deep

e73
clear whisper, ``one day when the 'prentice, and overlooked, and
manager, and all was off for dinner, I stopped behind 'me, and no-
ody seed me-no, not oneof'em. And while they were at dinner, I
slipped into the yard where the pigs bide, and then away again, all
upon the sly, to the door where they takes the list out. I thought
maybe, I might have the bolts to pull, but not a bit of it-there it
stood wide open, with a barrow full of rubbish between the posts-that
was fun1'
And here the poor creature laughed that dreadful laugh which none
but maniacs utter.
 But the fn lasted longer than that,'' she went on,  it lasted
while I creeped along to a mile or more among the bushes as grows
so rank t'other side the mill; and there I laid down at as in the
most of 'em, 'cause I heard a noise, and what d'he think it was?
What d'ye think the poor cretur heard with her heart galloping just
at the bottom of her throat, for all the world like the flap-flap-flap
of a ly-wheel ?''
Perhaps 'was a dog barking, Sally,'' said MIrs. Roberts, humour-
in the maniac as she made a pause.
No1 'was not a dog barking, nor it wasn't a wolf, nor it wasn't
a tiger; but it was something ten million of times worse than either-
It-was-the-'prentice-master :'' replied Sally, in a slow deep this-
per. ' It was the devilish 'prentice-master with his eyes of fire, and
his breath of flame. Oh-hI I feel him at my throat now1'' and she
claspel her withered neck with her pale thin hands, shuddering vio-
gently from head to foot.
Speak soherly, Sally, and like a sensible body, or you must not
go en., you know that,'' sail Mrs. Roberts, interesting in a warning
tone, which poor Sally seemed to understand, for though her breast
still heaved with a panting moment, like one who had run a race,
and was out of breath, she assumed an affected air of composure, put-
ting her hands before hcr primly. and shutting her eyes.
YEs, missing, I know that,'' she replied, easterly,  I know that
very well, and we won't trouble Joe ploughman to help us home this
time:; but I may go on, if I speak sensible, and like a wise woman, as
I am 2''
The farmer's wife nodded assent, and Sally continued more
quietly.
t It was the 'prentice-master, and none but he was dragged me forth,
head foremost, out of the bushes---very much like the butcher, you
know, my years, when he takes the little lamb's head between his two
hard hands-l never sees that up at Tom Blake's shambles, without
thinking of it. So he dragged me back again-and then to may
guess how the strap went1 But think of me: think what a spirit I
must have had in those days, my dears-will you believe that I made
up my mind to start again, though I hadn't a bit of unbridled skin
upon my body ?-I did though. Oh, dear1 oh, dear how I used
to hear the birds singing in my ears o' nights, when I laid down, and
made believe to sleep!  But I don't fancy it was sleep, not right


270
THE IFE AD ADVENTURES
which though forming a very isolated episode in the history of her
journey, shall be recounted, because the fact which it brought to her
knowledge is one that well deserves publicity.
The heiress varied her road homcwards, by driving though a village
which, were it not infested by the plague-pot of a factory, might be
considered as one of the most attractive in Derbyshire. At one
point the road passes through a rocky defile of such wild beauty, that
Mary, who was equally unacquainted with fine scenery, and capable of
enjoying it, called to the postboy to stop, that she might get out and
walk up the long ascent, in order the more thoroughly to enjoy the
widely-spreading landscape it commanded. Neither of her companions
accompanied her. MIrs. Teletext consenting, nothing loth, to remain
in the post-chaise, upon the steepness of the road being pointed out
to her, while little Fanny, though in her heart longing to spring after
her benefactors, replied to the observation, that she was not yet
strong enough to climb, by a look that spoke more of gratitude, than
regret.
It was alone, therefore, that MAry Brotherton started forward, her
active steps soon leaving the carriage behind; when cutting short the
spiral ascent by making her way through the underwood which clothed
the bank, she soon found herself high above the road, and on a spot of
great beauty. After lingering here for a few minutes she proceeded,
when hearing-the ever attractive sound of rushing waters, she again
stopped, and then, guided by her ear, followed where it led, till she
reached an opening, not far from the high-road, hut apart from it,
where, instead of the mountain cascade she had expected, a spectacle
greeted her that for an instant seemed to testify every nerve, and the
bounding elastic movement which had brought her within sight of it,
was changed to the rigid stillness of marble. A man, almost ferocious
in his aspect, from the squalid, unshorn, brutal negligence of decency
which it betrayed, was supporting in his arms, and on his bosom, a boy
of ten or eleven years old, whose ghastly countenance showed plainly
that death was busy at his heart.- BEfore the rock from whence flowed
the gushing stream, whose sound had brought MIss Brotherton to the
spot, stood what looked like the fragment of a rude pillar, and on this
stone the' father had rested the wasted form of his dying child. Be-
for him stood a little girl gazing on the boy with a mixture of infant
fear and sisterly love, as she tended a bowl, filled from the spring, to
his lips.
 He is very oIl1'' said Mary, addressing the father,` can I go and
where to get help for you2''
The man, who had the fragment of a pipe in his mouth, an who
looked rather bewildered, and fiercely angry, than oppressed by for-
row, stared at her, but answered not a word.
 What is the matter with him?'' said Miss Brotherton, addressing
the title girl.

it. Mother said, when we started, that he looked as if he'd never
come back alive; but he'd have had to pay double fine if so be as
father had left him to ride at home, so he carried him to mill; but
though they strapped him, and strapped him, he couldn't stand to his
work, and he have been lying in the mill-yard till father come to take
him.''
This horrible statement was uttered amidst tears and sobs, but poor
MAry lost not a word of it; and as her very soul sickened at the tale,
she felt tempted to believe that she was doomed to witness every cio-
cumstance that could most painfully recall the source whence all her
greatness flowed.
With clasped hands, and streaming eyes, she stood silently watch-
in the gasping breath of this young victim of unnatural labour. The
boy's eyes fixed themselves on the face of his little sister. Ile might
be listening to her history of his early fate-or he might be consciously
taking a last look at what loved. In either case the effort demanded
more strength than was left him-his eyes closed, a shivering move-
ment passed through all his frame, and then he became still. The
quick, short, unequal heaving of the breast was seen no more, and
Mary hid her eyes as the mysterious change, which no human being
can gae upon unmoved, came on the stiffening features. It was
rather instinct than feeling, which prompted her even at that awful
moment to profler what she had learned to know would be felt as con-
solution, did one starving member of a family alone survive amidst the
dying and the dead of a whole race. Without venturing again to look
at the father and his son, she dropped into the bowl, which the little
girl still held, what she hated to think would soon turn natural sor-
row into unnatural forgetfulness of it: but she had no power to serve
them more effectually, and hastily turning into the road, she awaited
the slow arrival of the post-chaise in a state of mind which left no
faculty at leisure to enjoy any longer the hills and valleys for whose
sake she had left it.
From this time the journey homeward proceeded without accident
or adventure of any kind, and Mary would probably have shared the
pleasure so energetically expressed by MIrs. Tremble at being restored
to the luxurious tranquillity of MIlford Park, had not the heavy news
she carried to the poor Armstrong made her dread the day that
would follow her reaching it.
But how she got through that painful day, and all that resulted from
it-how little Fanny Fletcher fared in her new and most strange home,
and whether her patroness had most reason to bless or deplore the
sudden movement which had caused her to hazard the blending thus
the destiny of one so utterly unknown, with her on, must all be re-
served for future narration, as the adventures of michael Armstrong, of
necessity, draw the pen of his historian elsewhere.

TRE LIFE ANd ADVENTURES
for I knows be a deal better, old woman, than to at any such affirant
upon ye. You just stop the creature from dying, if you can, for that
wiLl suit me a deal best just now,''
The will of Mr. Woodcock, thus clearly expressed, was acted upon
with very implicit obedience; the consequence of which was, that
Michael Armstrong as not only saved from death, but his constitution
greatly benefited. Molly Bing had pledged her judgment upon the
result of his case, and in order to prove it correct, she contrived that
he should swallow about ten times as much nourishment as fell to the
share of any other child in the mill. Head grown surprisingly during
the period of his confinement, and this gave so lengthy a look to his
thin person, that MOlly more than once fancied the audacious little
villain would give her the lie at last: so she not only fed him, but got
leave for him to clean out the pig-sites, scrape up the filth from the
yard, and sundry other jobs of the same description, all of which, how-
ever unsavoury in their nature, more, as the sharp-witted old woman
well knew, the ball of health in every movement they enforced, com-
pared to the monotonous and grinding slavery of the mill. But in
the course of a month or two, another glorious proof of England's
prosperity reached the Deep Valley, in the shape of a large order, and
Mr. Elwood Sharpton, in communicating the cheering intelligence to
his manager, enforced the necessity of strenuous exertion in the
execution of it, by telling him that, sick or well, the children must
work long hours, and that it was far better that they should a little
overwork the hands, than in any risk of disappointing so valuable a
customer,
In consequence of these instructions, Michael was withdrawn from
his out-door labours, and once more made to follow the mules. It
was then, and then only, that he discovered the heavy loss he had sus-
trained by the departure of Fanny. While employed upon the out-
of-door tasks assigned to him by the commands of MOlly Bing, he had
been strictly enjoined never to speak to any of the apprentices who
might chance to pass while he was at work. His meals were eaten in
MI.. Woodlcomb's kitchen, and the place assigned for his lodging by
night, was a sort of closet that opened from it. No day, no hour had
passed, unless in sleep, since he recovered his senses, without his
thinking of her. At the risk, or rather with the certainty of cuffs and
hard words, no foot-fall had ever passed within his hearing without
causing him to turn his head to reconnoitre, and much as he preferred
the labour on which he was now employed to that of the mill, he
would willingly, nay joyfully, hae exchanged it in the hope of again
seeing his little friend. It was therefore with a feeling of gladness,
instead of regret, that he received orders to turn into the factory.
 That is queer'' thought the little fellow, as he bounded to obey
the command, with the double energy of recovered health, and
awakened hope, `` it is queer for me to feel glad that I am going back
to the factory:'
As it happened, he was marshalled into the same room in which he

261
had worked before his illness-but alas1 when he turned his eyes to
the spot where Fanny had formerly occupied near him, a singularly
ill-favoured boy met his gaze, instead of the pretty creature he
sought for. This was a death-blow to the joy which a few minutes
before had given him a gait and an expression of counteuance so
unwanted in a factory-boy returning to his well-known sufferings.
Nevertheless, though a tear blinded the eyes which at length settled
reluctantly on the broken threads which awaited his fingers, he reem-
breed that the factory had seven floors, and cruel as it was to lose the
pleasure of giving his little friend a look or a word as they each paced
their weary walk, he still thought he might get a sight of her at thein
dismal meals, and fancied that he should not greatly regret exchanging
scraps of wholesome meat, for musty oatmeal, provided Fanny
Fletcher was by to tell him not to mind it. BUt the musty oatmeal
came all too son, for no word or look of Fanny's came with it: nor
did any uncertainty long remain, on which to hang a lingering hope
that some unfinished task detained her in the mill, and that he should
see her soon. His first question, whispered to the girl who sat beside
him, brought forth the history of Fanny's wonderful departure, at as
full length as the time and place would permit. At first he listened to
it with incredulity. It seemed, he thought, like a story made up to
deceive him, for fun; and little as the blighted young spirits of that
sad fraternity were given to jesting, Michael clung to the belief that
such was the case, as long as the meal lasted. But, as usual, a few
minutes followed, during which they were left alone-an indulgence
which necessarily arose from the fact, that even the niggardly allow-
ance of time awarded by the regulations of Mr. Elwood sHarpton for
their meals, was more than the famished children required for devour-
ing the scanty portion se before them. No sooner had Mr. Poulet
withdrawn himself, after witnessing the orderly consumption by each,
of the allotted morsel, than such of the miserable crew as had sur-
lived the pestilence, and remembered the close alliance between Mi-
chapel and the heroine of the marvellous tale which was still in every
mouth, all rushed together towards him for the purpose of recounting
it. Notwithstanding the confusion of tongues, their noisy testimony
was too consistent to admit of doubt, and MIchael remained with the
astounding belief that his little friend was taken away to be made a
great Lady of.
The heart of Michael Armstrong proved itself to be a very generous
one on this occasion.
Same natural tears he shed, but wiped them soon.'
as he remembered that the more miserable the situation in which he
was left, the more he ought to rejoice that Fanny had been taken from
it. And he did rejoice; truly, sincerely, and at the very bottom of his
heart did he rejoice. As day after day the hateful routine of uva-
trying suffering again laid its grasp upon his existence, with a power as
irresistible as that of the vast engine which within those prison-walls


284
THE LIFE AND DEfENSE
This resolution was not very steadily adhered to; but the struggle
to do it, which was perfectly sincere, made the poor boy moody, and
more miserable than ever. His dreams perpetually represented to him
is mother and helpless brother, suffering From some kindness from
Fanny, whom he saw superlative beautiful, and superlative rich,
but more superlative hard-hearted still. These nervous and irritating
imitations brought his mother and brother so vividly before him, that
for weeks he could neer, whether waking or sleeping, get them out of
his head. He fancied himself again running at full speed from Dow-
ling Lodge, with MArtha's basket on his arm: his mother's little room,
decent anl orderly in spite of poverty, came back upon his mind as if
he had left it but yesterday. Ile saw the soft expression of her faded
countenanee, and tell the welcome of her fond embrace.
Oh, fool oh, proud and nickel fool1'' he murmurel to his
tear-stained pillow, as these, and a thousand other tender recollections
pressed upon him. e WHy could I not endure the tyrant's cruelty? 1
might have kissed her now I might have comforted poor eddy.''
The sound of his own voice as he pronounced this dear familiar name,
though in a whisper too low to awaken the weary sleepers round him,
wrung his very heart by the vivid recollections which it brought, and
though he was now beyond fourteen years old, he cried himself to
sleep.
Fiful and feverish were the transitions of his mind at this period.
sOmetimes he persuaded himself that his mother was no more, that the
loss of him had broken her heart, and that she had died, believing him
to have gone before her, At other times it was Edward whom he wept
as dead. His shattered health, his feeble limbs were., as he thought,
sure evidence that nature meant him not to strugglelong against the
misery of his lot, and there were moments in which this persuasion
even soothed him.
e Sweet fellow 1'' thought he.  How calm and beautiful he must
have looked in death Even in suffering, even in agony, his coun-
penance was lovely-so patient, and so heavenly mild1 Better, far
better he should die, than live a factory-boy like me1''
And then again his mood would change, and he had for ever before
him images of the most fearful destitution-his mother starving, and
Edward slowly perishing beside her, because he had been too proud
and too impatient to endure sundry buffetings and other indignities,
which, when put in competition with the thought of having injured
them, dwindled into petty injuries, which he deserved eternal shame
for shrinking from.
Dreadful were the hours he thus spent: and, fearful to think of, was
the hopeless, helpless, joyless, comfortable existence by which he held to
earth His very soul sickened as he looked around him, and read in
every withered melancholy face the history of blasted youth, and the
prophecy of premature death.

Michael Armstrong's was one of them. Nature and accident together

the fact was completely ascertained and known to nearly every inmate
of the mill.
Mr. Poulet's second wife, to whom he had then been married about
three years, was in appearance the very reverse of the first, being as
remarkably small, as the other was large. bUt what she wanted in
muscle, was made up in watchfulness. Nothing escaped her restless
and malignant little eyes, and either from the incessant danger of hen
spying sharpness, or the propensity of the human mind to think pre-
sent suffering worse than every other, there were many who declared
they would be glad to have her brutal predecessor back again. It
was this woman who first described the absence of Michael from the
board.
eHallo: where is No. 57 ' she cried.
No one could answer; and No. 5 was sought for in vain from one
end of the premises to the other.
e THe is gone through the yard-door I'' proclaimed the active and
intelligent MIrs. Poulet, after discovering that the bolt was with-
drawn.  Of with you, you stupid old fool '' she added, addressing
her husband;  what d'ye stand staring there for? If you had the
bit of a jackass, you might trace him by his feet on the des-for there

and so in truththere were. A continuous track of postmarks, ere
easily traced from the door to the steep bank being the factory,
where they were lost in the convert of bushes, which had of late years
been coaxed to clothe its sides for the purpose of furnishing fagots.
That some one had recently broken through these bushes was equally
evident, from many boughs having been torn, and the soil beneath
them trampled. This was enough to direct the pursuit, with so much
certainty of being right, that Mlr. WYoolcomb laughed as he gave the
orders for it.
The bushes last for about half a mile,'' said he, `` and then he
must take over the hills, of course' Fine fellow, isn't he? It will be
mighty hard to take him again, won't it? There's only three justices
of peace for him to be handed to, and only every man he meets ready
to introduce him. The worst misfortune is, that I don't quite see
where he is to get his dinner,''
Two stout overlooked started accordingly upon the track thus easily
hit upon, and Mr. Woodceomb awaited the result of their exertions
without the slightest anxiety, or any irritation of nerves whatever;
albeit he knew that, favourite as he was, he might run no small risk of
Losing his place, should one of the apprentices really escape-but the
thing was impossible; no one could live without eating, not been one
who had served his apprenticeship to staring as well as piecing at the

ignorance of the fact that MIchael Armstrong was already within a
few feet of his premises.

I is not necessary that the narrative should briefly return to the
period of Miss robertson's arrival at Milford Park, after her unsuc-
careful expedition in pursuit of Michael.
There was no needless delay between this return to her home, and
the communication to MIrs. Armstrong and Edward of the dismal news
of which she was the bearer: nor was there any consultation on this
occasion, concerning the mode of her reaching Huxley-lane. Poor
Mary had greatly advanced in independence of spirit within the last
few months; and had she encountered all the military quartered with-
in twenty miles, with the Dowling family marching in procession at
their head, she would have quietly driven through them all, with the
carriage-windows up, perhaps, but with no greater precaution-except,
indeed, an order to the bachman to drive on without stopping, let
them meet who they would.
The carriage was at the door the morning after their return, and
MIss IBrotherton had not yet named her intended expedition to Mrs.
Teletext.
 You are going out without me my dear?'' said the old Lady on
hearing it announced.
I am going to the widow Armstrong's, lear nurse,'' replied the
heiress. t Your presence cannot help me through this dreaded visit.
Then why should I make you share the pain of it2''
 WHy ? my dear because I am of no earthly use, and had better die
at once if I cannot be of some little comfort to you at such a time as
this. Why, don't I know all about it, and how you must feel at this
very moment, just as well as you do yourself, Mary Sure it was a
foolish notion to leave me here enjoying the arm-chair and the foot-
stool, and the flowers, while you are having your heart broken by
telling that poor pale body, that the child she loved so dearly is dead
and gone for ever,''
If' you could save either her or me a pang, nurseTremlett, I would
not thus have spared yo,'' replied Miss Brotherton. ``However, you
shall go with me, dear friend. It is quite like yourself to wish it--
and in truth, I might have guessed that you could not have remained
easy and quiet at home while I was so engage. And poor fAnny
--I have left her very busy with Martin, assisting in training the

we are going, in case she should come in here to look for us ?''

all over again; for of course, when MIrs. Armstrong hears that you
have got with you the only person who can tell any thing about her
boy, she will be restless and anxious to see her-and then won't it be
all over again, Hilary 2'
It will, indeed, dear nursel You are very right, and very wise in
this. She shall go with us, poor child. Though it will be a dreadful
task for her'' replied Mary.
And you would rather take it, dear, all on your own shoulders ?
I do not doubt that-only you don't know how to manage it,'' replied
Mrs, Teletext.  But there is another thing, DIary, that I have been
thinking of,'' continued the kind-hearted old woman, '' and that is the
other poor boy. Ill engage t say, he has never missed school for an
hour, after what you said to him about exerting himself. I saw how
he took it; and, therefore, you may depend upon it, that he is at the
schoolhouse now. Then just think, my dear, what his going home will
e after you have told all Poor creatures It makes one's heart
sick to fancy it If I were you, Mary, I would send for him, tell him
every thing at one, and then take him home to his mother.'
MIss Brotherton instantly rose and rang the bell.
Do not say you are of no use, my dear good creature l'' said she.
 HOw infinitely better this will be than the hurried, houghtless plan
which I had sketched
A message was accordingly espatched to the schoolhouse to sum-
mon Edward Armstrong, and in a few minutes he stood before them.
Most true is it that there is something holy and imposing in the
presence of sorrow. It would be difficult to imagine any entree into
the boudoir of Miss Brotherton, which would have inspired a feeling
both in her and her friend so nearly approaching ae, as did that of
Edward Armstrong.
 There is no need to tell him, poor fellow I'' exclaimed Mrs. Them-
lett, mournful shaking her head, as she saw the sudden and eloquent
change in Elward's countenance the moment he looked in the face of
Miss Brotherton.  There is no need to tell him1 He knows it all,
already I'
IlIe is deal, then'' said the of, his pale lips parting, as it
seemed, with difficulty, to pronounce the words, `` Please, ma'am, lct
me go away.''
He looked as if he were unable to sustain himself;: and MAry,
really fearing he might fall, started from her seat, and throwing her
arms round him, almost carried him to the sofa.
No, no, my poor Elwardt'' she said, ''to not go away. Stay
with those who love and pity you Poor Michael is dead, Edward,
and we must all try to support your mother under the dreadful
news.''
How do you know he is dead?'' cried Edward, starting up, and
looking almost sternly at his benefactors.  How do you know that
they have not had him away where you cannot find him, that they may
torture him, and work him to the bone, when there is nobody by to
see e
or ISRAEL ARISTONG.

:1 know that he is dead but too well, Edward,'' replied Mary,
gently. 1 have brought home with me a little girl who worked in the
same factory, and who knew him well. IIe died of an infectious fever
that killed many, any more. I am going to take this little girl with
me to your mother, Edward, that she may question her, if she wishes
it, about poor Michael, and I wish you to go with us, my lear boy; it
is better that your poor mother should have you with her.''
You are going to tell mother ?'' said the boy with a shudder.
 Yes, Elward 1-it must be done, and the sooner it is over the
better. Your mother is a good woman, and a pious Christian, my
dear boy. She will know and feel that all that can befall her is the
will of God; and when she remembers this, she will rise above her
sorrow, and thinking of the better world hereafter, will be able to say,
His will be done'''
 Yes, ma'am-if it does not kill her first,'' answered Edward.
Indeed, I think a great deal will depend on how, dear Edward, as
to her manner of bearing it. If she sees you sink, be sure she will
sink too; but if you make her feel that she has still a beloved child to
live for, to whom life may yet be a blessing, she will cease to refine
for the loss of one child, for the sake of making the other happy.''
Edward slowly and silently shook his head; but after the mean-
holy silence of a minute or two, he said, I will do my best,
ma'am,''
The scene which followed beside the bed of the poor widow, was
one of such deep, but patient sorry, as left an impression never to
be forgotten on the minds of those who witnessed it. Mary's counsel
had not been thrown away upon Edward. The boy displayed both a
delicacy and firmness of character beyond his years, and above his
education. No ordinary topics of consolation were clumsily uttered
to redeem his pledge to mAry, nor did he affect a stoical indifference
which he could not feel; but with gentle endearments he drew the
mourning mother to think of him, and there was healing, as well as
agony, in the years she shed upon his bosom.
O all this Fanny was a silent, but deeply-moved spectator. The
widow gave her one earnest look when Mary said,  This little girl was
the last person who spoke to Michael before he was laid on the sick
bed from whence he never rose, and she seems to have loved him
deadly.''
One long earnest look was turned upon her when this was said, but
no word was spoken to her, for the time was not yet come when the
bereaved mother could seek comfort in any thing. Nevertheless, when
Miss Brotherton rose to go, and pressing the hand of the poor suflerer
in her own, promised to pay her another visit soon, MIrs: Armstrong
murmured in her esr,  I should like to see that little girl again,
when I can bear to name him.'' Mary nodded her assent, and left the
mother and son to exchange thoughts and feelings, which, when deep
and genuine, must ever be held sacred from every uninsured eye.
Most watchful did Mary attend to this poor pensioner: and many
were the hours during which she sat, reading the book of life beside

to watch some favourable moment, she might have the surpassing joy
of seeing his heart open to the truth, and in a state to permit her help-
in to lead him to efficient repentance, and theall-merciful forgiveness
of God. It was impossible but that such thoughts and feelings trust
separate her, more than ever, from the rest of her family, and she had
already pretty generally received the epithet of methodistical, from
the whole neighbourhood: but she hailed it as a blessing, and without
a shadow of religious enthusiasm, beyond what was almost inevitable
under the circumstances, and with no sectarian views or notions what-
ever, poor Martha gladly sheltered herself under the imputation of both
in order to avoid joining in scenes of amusement for which she had no
relish,
In such a state of mind it was natural enough that Martha should
deem a visit to the bereaved mother a penance which it was her duty
to perform (though it was more painful to her, perhaps, than almost
any other to which she could have been subjected), and she did per-
for it accordingly. She found the poor sufferer, whose eye she
dreaded to meet, sinking fast into peace and rest, that never more could
be disturbed, MIss Brotherton and Fanny were both with her; a
bible was in the hands of the former, and MIrs. Armstrong's county-
nance, though greatly more pinched and pallid than she had ever be-
fore seen it, expressed a tranquil calmness which it was impossible to
contemplate without pleasure.
But, alas: for poor Martial she had the pang of seeing this con-
sold and cooling look suddenly changed to an expression of intense
suffering, the moment her own person met the poor woman's eye.
They had never seen each other since the fatal morning on which
Martha had so innocently persuaded her to sign the articles of her boy's
apprenticeship, and the recollection of that scene, and all its con-
sequences, could not so suddenly come upon onc, reduced already
t almost the last stage of weakness, without shaking her terribly.
The distended eye, the open mouth, the heavsing breast, all spoke a
degree of agitation, which in her condition was frigltfully alarming:
and Mary, who dreaded lest the calmness of her last moments should
be disturbed, hastily turned to the intruder, and said, ' Go, go-
the sight of you will kill her1'
Though there was no more of harshness in this, than the urgent cir-
cumstanees of the case seemed to call for, MAry Brotherton would
have rather died than utter it, could she have guessed the pang it
gave to the already wounded heart of poor Martha. She made no re-
ply; but, fixing on the victim of her most innocent delusion, a look,
just long enough to impress the terrible expression of her countenance
pon her own heart for over, she turned away, and reached hcr spleen-
did home in a state of mind that seemed fearfully to verify the annum-
citation,`` He will visit the sins of the fathers upon the children.''
That day was the last of the widow's life, and it is probable it might
have been so, even if Martha Dowling had not made her `unfortunate
visit; but the coincidence was fatal to the poor girl's peace, for the
anxious inquiries she made respecting her, brought the intelligence of

neighbourhood, and for several months after her return she contented
herself with following Mr, Bell's prescriptions, for friction and moderate
exercise, without calling in any medical assistance tall. But though
the improvement that followed was very perceptible, it was not rapid,
and the idea of London advice suggested itself, as the most satisfactory
mode of ascertaining at once whether a perfect recovery might be hoped
for; information which it was very desirable she should obtain, before
she decided in what way she should bring him up. Since the death
of his mother, Milford Park had been Edward's home, and the orphan
boy's hold on Miss Brotherton's warm heart had been greatly increased
by the opportunities this gave her of more frequent intercourse with
her. In truth, though he still attended the school for an hour or two
every morning, by far the more important portion of his education went
on under her own eye, and, as well as that of his little companion
Fanny, was beginning to take a form and extent totally different from
what she had at first intended for either of them. ideas respecting
them both, began by degrees to arise in her mind, which she at first
endeavoured to resist, as being too much out of the usual course to
he safely indulged in: but '` nse lessens marvel,'' and the notion of
making a man of learning of Edward, and a woman of fortune of
Fanny, which once and again she had rejected, as too romantic and
absurd, gradually grew into an habitual theme of meditation on which
her fancy delighted to fx itself.
Mary Drotherton was at that time about twenty-two years old, ex-
extremely pretty, and moreover almost childishly young-looking for her
age; andwhatever she might have brought herself to think of it, most others
would very naturally have deemed her adopting a boy of twelve, and a
girl of eleven, a most outrageously preposterous and imprudent act.
BUt her situation was one in most respects quite out of the common
way, and she every day felt it more impossible that she could continue
to endure the station of one of the magnates of a manufacturing neigh-
bourhaol, with all eyes fixed upon every thing she did, and her whole
heart and soul recoiling from companionship with the only persons
whom her neighbours and watchers would deem fit to be her particular
friends.
The heart of this isolated girl was so clinging affectionate that it
is probable she would, under almost any other circumstances, have at
least loved the beautiful mansion in which she had passed the greatest
part of her life, and felt the trees and flowers that adorned it to be as
companions, and familiar friends; but a thousand painful thoughts
were mingled with the consciousness that she was mistress of that fair
domain; and the very fact that the education she felt inclined to be-
stow upon the two orphans would bring down upon her the criticisms,
and probably the reprobation, of the hole neighbourhood, making it
very desirable that the extraordinary project should be carried into
execution elsewhere, was in her estimation more in its favour, than
agains it. When, in addition to all this, she succeeded in persuading
herself, from some of her miscellaneous reading, that there were Ger-
man baths which might assist the restoration of Edward's limbs, and
296
E LIPE AND ADVENTURE
that it was her duty to consult the most approved authorities upon his
case, the decision to leave MIlford Park, and remove to London, was
at no great distance.
Had her valued friend and counsellor, Mr. Bell, led her to believe
that all the wealth she had, if thrown back among the class from which
it was drawn, could have sufficed to remedy the evils under which they
groaned, she was quite capable of stripping herself to her last shilling
for the purpose; but he knew better, and he taught her to know better
too; and having convinced himself that his best chance of happiness,
as well as her best opportunity of doing good, would be in yielding to
the election which  her boy and girl'' had inspired, he promised to
assist her projected removal, by seeing that the orders she left, respect-
in her property, were faithfully executed: and, about eight months
after the death of Mrs. Armstrong, the heiress left her parks and
gardens, her splendid mansion and all its gorgeous appurtenances, to
attend the orphan boy to London.
The consultation which, immediately after her arrival there, took
place on the case of Edward, was productive of, perhaps, the
greatest pleasure MAry had ever known; for the sentence unanimously
pronounced was, that the limbs of the boy were in a state of progress
towards perfect recovery, the weakness and distortion brought on by
his employment, not haring lasted long enough to produce any de-
format, capable of resisting the tendency of nature to recover herself,
if not impeded by any fresh unhealthy influence. That any such
should arise to disappoint her hopes was not likely: all that was re-
quired for him being good air, regular and moderate exercise, whole-
some food, and abstinence from all violent exertion for the next year
or two. As to her question respecting German baths, the answer
was less unanimous:; two gentlemen being of opinion that they would
do no good at all; to that it was doubtful whether the case would be
affected by them or not; and one that great benefit might probably
ensue. But as all were of opinion that change of air was desirable,
and as a pretty strong inclination to try fresh fields and pastures new
seconded this judgment, Miss Brotherton determined to start for the
Rhine. MIrs, Teletext declared that she had not the slightest ob-
section to foreign parts; Edward's heart swelled with an ecstasy made
up of gratitude, hope, curiosity, another delicious exhilaration attendant
upon returning health; while Fanny looked around her, and listened
to every one whose words referred to the expedition, with a very de-
rightful consciousness of being wide awake, but not without some fear
that she was dreaming, nevertheless.
Such was the party that filled the travelling-carriage of Miss Bro-
theron, while an English maid, a French footman, and a German
courier, formed her suite.
Nothing, certainly, could be well more whimsical than the party
with which she had thus surrounded herself; but this mattered little,
since she was pleased with it-and we must leave her in the full enjoy-
ment of a whole host of delightful feelings, while we return to follow
the fortunes of poor michael.

Wmi this gay and happy party, who would any of them have
gladly exchanged pleasure for pain, could they,thereby have purchased
only the knowledge of his existence, were thus placing kingdoms be-
tween them, the unhappy Michael was still enduring all the miseries of
an apprentice at the Deep Valley Mill.
It would be difficult to imagine a stronger contrast in the situation
of two brothers than that which many subsequent years presented be-
tween him and lEeward. Edward-who had ever been to him as a
dearcr second self-who had never enjoyed a pleasure unshared by
him, and never known a sorrow that had not also been his-Edward was
enjoying all that nature and fortune could give; while Michael still
hopelessly dragged on a wretched existence amidst unceasing and un-
trying suffering At length the desperate resolution was formed
which put the officials of the Deep VAlley factory in the state of
activity already described. And where was Michael the while?
Safely ensconced in a sort of rude drain, which he had himself
assisted to construct, when he held the regretted office of scavenger
of the court, and over the aperture of which he easily arranged sticks
and rubbish sufficient to conceal him, Michael lay for many hours
listening to the hubbub which his absence occasioned. He distinctly
heard the expression of Mrs, Poulet's anger and scorn, as messenger
after messenger returned, without bringing timings of him: and had,
moreover, the advantage of knowing the track that he had purposely
made on the grass which grew tall and rank immediately behind the
factory, had led them, and would continue to lead them, all one way,
while he would of course take esptecial care to go another.
HAving left his foot-marks on the grass in the manner described,
Michael had scrambled through the bushes which covered the steep
hill-side, for the distance of a few hundred yards, and then, taking
advantage of a layer of stones, by which a patch of marshy ground had
been rendered firm, he again crossed from the hill towards the factory
without leaving any trace behind. By this simple device his pur-
users were completely thrown out, for when night came and he crawled
out from his shelter, no eye was open to look for him close to his
prison-walls, though very keen ones were busy elsewhere in search of
him.
The same strength of frame which had enabled him to escape de-
format in the mill, helped him well now, as without fool, without

 Died :'' echo Michael, looking wildly at her. Is he dead
too?' Is my poor Teddy end2'
Sure-ly he is,'' replied the unthinking young woman, who, in
truth, knew nothing about either the widow Armstrong or her son, but
remembered hearing that a little more than a year before she took
possession of the premises, a wide Armstrong had died in the back
room, for grief at having lost a boy. She was far from intending to
be cruel to the poor lal, who looked himself so very nearly like a
corpse, but was too indifferent upon all subjects which did not mime-
lately concern herself, to take the trouble of thinking before she
spoke.
A few more questions might probably have obtained, if not the
truth, at least some proof of his informer's ignorance of it, but
Michael ha heard enough: he rose to his feet, and without uttering
another word, rushed out of the room.
Theatre in which he then found himself was certainlynearlyapproach-
ing to delirium. kis strength of body and mind completely exhausted
by fatigue, fasting, and intense anxiety, the blow which had fallen
upon him was heavier than hisreason could bear, and he wandered
forth into the fields without knowing where he was, or having any dis-
tinct idea of what had befallen him. IIis devious and unheedel
path led him to a spot, at the distance of nearly a mile from his former
home, at which several miniature rocks of sandstone give something of
wildness and dignity to the little stream, which for the most part runs
tamely enough, and looks little more than a wide and dirty ditch, as
it passes through the town of Ashleigh. A multitude of cotton-
factories, with their tall chimneys mocking the heavens, were visible in
the distance, on the other side, and the boy stopped in his wild, hur-
died walk, to gaze upon them, with a feverish consciousness that there
at least stood something he had seen before. A frightful Flash of
memory- then shot across `his brain-his mother dead-his darling
Edward dead-himself a horseless, friendless, starving wretch, who
soon would be caught and carried back to the prison-house he had
ran from only to learn that he had no friend on earth Such were the
thouhtewich rachel him, as he stood upon the edge of the rocky
little precipice, and film his eyes upon the quiet water that flowed
sometwenty feet beneath him. It seemed to present an image of
coolness and repose'; his burning lips longed to kiss the gentle ripple
on  its surface-he drew nearer to the extremist verge.

sick headresled,  God forgive mei' he called, raising his eyes to
heaven. BUt if I brown,'mother: I shall go to theft'' and as he
spoke the words, he sprang forward, and plunged into the stream:
The shock restored his wandering senses in a moment; he felt that
he was perishing, though conscious that it was by his own act:; and
forgetting how little reason he had to wish for life, struggled hard to
grasp a bush that protruded from the bank into the stream. But he
could not swim, and the efforts he made, though they served for a
minute or to to keep himalaya, only increased the distance between

himself and the object he endeavoured to reach. His heavy shoes
filled with water, and dragged him downwards-his strength failed,
his arms ceased to move, and in another moment the water rippled
over his head.
ut poo Michael's history was not finished.yet. A heavy-looking
elderly man, who had as little as possible the air of one desirous of.
seeking an adventure, was in the act of examining some sheep in a
field, the fence of which was not fifty yards from the rocky ledge from
whence the boy had spring. Having completed his survey, and di-
erected two men who were with him to select a score or two from the
lot, the old man reposed himself upon a style in the fence above men-
toned, and having chanced to turn his head from the sheep, towards
the spot where Michael stood, had watched for a minute or two the
boy's agitated movements and demeanour, but without the slightest
suspicion of the frightful catastrophe that was to ensue.
No sooner, however, did he hear the splash occasioned by the
plunge, than he sprang over the style with the activity of a younger
man, and calling to the others to follow him, made his way with little
loss of time, to a bit of pebble ground on a level with the stream, and
at no great distance from the point at which Michael had sunk. But,
short as the time had been, the ripple had already disappeared from
the surface of the water, and no trace remained of the object of his
search. The two young men whom he had summoned to follow him,
though they had not seen the accident, had gathered from his words
that something terrible had occurred, and clambering down the rocky
cliff, were by his side in a moment.
It is too late, lads1'' exclaimed the old man, wringing his hands
together. `' I saw the poor distracted creature take the leap, but he
was sunk before I got to the bank, and i take it he will never rise
again. I shall never forgive myself for not going to him when I saw
him throwing his arms about in that wild way. I might have guessed
what was going to happen-and may Heaven forgive me for not pre-
venting it1''
 Is a man who has thrown himself in ?'' inquired one of the men.
t Not a man, but a five young lad as ever you see. Poor fellow
Was early days for him to have found sorrow enough to throw
himself out of life that way1 It I had ran to him, as a ought to have
done, and stopped the deed, who knows but we might have brought
him round to a better manner of thinking ?''
 'Tis ten to one but he'll come to the top again yet, if he hasn't
done it already,'' said the man.
But if he comes, he'll come dead, William t'' replied the old
Iran.
I don't know that,'' rejoined the young shepherd.''  The stream
runs british round yon corner, and would carry him right away with
it; but it's worth while having look lower down. If he rises at all,
will be there.''
And so saying, the young man set off at a swifter pace than his
master could follow him ; while the old man and the other shepherd-

as of more, but not one of them recognised the widow Armstrong's
boy, in the long-limbed, pallid figure, that they now gazed upon
Muster Thornton, the Westmnorland yeoman and farmer, was too
substantial a customer to be refused any reasonable favour, and the
ggged, dripping MIchael was not only permitted to lie down on
Muster Thornton's best of beds, but accommodated promptly with dry
linen, and duly comforted with more hot brandy, water, sugar, and
biscuits than he had any inclination to swallow. He took enough,
however, to remove the faintness of inflation; and this, together with
dry Linen, and a bed, sufficed, in spite of the heavy sorrows upon
which his mind had not yet dared to fix itself, to sooth him into a
long and healing sleep.
WHen he awoke from it, he was capable of answering all the
questions Mr, Thornton put to him, and this he did with a simplicity
of pathos that went straight to the good man's heart. That he had
been working in a distant cotton-factory, where he had been very
hardly treated, and having got away to see his mother and his brother,
had found them both dad, was a tale, that if it could not excuse the
desperate act which he had attempted, at least accounted for it, in a
manner that left as much to city as to blame.
Poor holy poor boy I'' exclaimed the old man, with tears in his
cfcs. `' I1 was wrong and wicked, very wrong and wickedlI but you
must pray God to forgive you, my bay, and never think of any such
desperate doing more.''
 1 did not know what I was about, if I remember rightly,'' said
Michael. : My head seemed gone. I don't know how I got to the
river, but I am sure I did not go there on purpose.''
sO much the better-i am glad to hear it-and it's no great won-
der, sure enough, if you did lose your head, coming to such a home
as that. But what are you to do next, my poor fellow2 I suppose
there is no other home for you, is there?''
I have no home, for a single friend in the whole world,'' replied
Michael.
 And the only work you have ever been used to, I suppose, is fol-
losing the wheels in the factories ?'' said the farmer.
 EXcept once for three months and a bit that I was kept to cleaning
the outhouses and war, and wheeling away garden-rubbish and such
like,'' replied Michael.
 WEll, but that better than nothing, boy. At any rate, you know
how to hold a spade, which is a long deal better than having never
used your fingers, except for tying bits of thread. D'ye think you
should be willing to work for me, my boy, and tend my farm-yard
stock, and do a turn of work in the fields when it was wanted ?''
I should be willing, sir,' replied Michael, while a flush passe
over his pale face, `` I should he killing and most thankful to work for
you.''
 That's well,'' said the old man cheerily, `` and as to terms, I don't
expect we shall find much difficulty; you will come to me my po
fellow, much in the same condition as to first come into the world,

THE LIFE AND ADVENTURes
therefore all that you want, lI must find, which will be about as much
as I can afford to give, I take it, just at first, till you, and I to, find
out what you're good for, All you agree to it, my lad, and give me
your time and best endeavours for clothes, food, lodging, and good
will1 
It will be a blessed bargain for me, sir,'' said Michael, ' if you
will add to all your goodness the excusing my ignorance. But if
will was all that was wanting to make a good servant, you should not
lose by me.''
'' And will is all that is wanting, boy. You are no fool, I take it,
by your looks;: and if you will mint what is said, and do your best, I
shall ask no more. What is your name, my good fellow 2
 Michael-Michael Armstrong, sir.''
 Well, then, Michael Armstrong, I am your master, and you are
my man And now you must eat, and then you must go to sleep
again, I think, till I have got some decent clothes for you. Those you
wore yesterday have had a good washing to be sure. Nevertheless, I
don't justly like the looks of them.''
WIthin six months from this time, Michael Armstrong, promoted to
a place of trust, might have been seen sitting upon the hill-side in one
of the most romantic spots in WVestmorland, a shepherd's maud
wrapped round his person, a sheep-dog at his feet, and his master's
flanks nibbling the short grass around him on all sides. Many were
the solitary hours he thus passed, and vary rich was the harvest they
brought him. Had the boy remained a year or two longer in the state
that
Works out the forms of nature, prezonsmes
The reason, famishes the east, shut up
The infant being in itself, and make
Its very spring a season of decay 
had Michael remained a year or two longer at the Deep Valley fac-
tory, in the state thus admirably and accurately described, it would
have been too late for any contemplation of God's works to have
roused his withered spirit to worship and to hope. But as it was, his
mind seemed to awaken day by day from the long and heavy sleep in
which it had been plunged. With an intellect naturally vigorous, and
covetous of requirement, and having had his first infant stretch of
thought happily and indelibly directed, though with primeval simply-
city, to one God and father of all, his transition from a condition in
which
to one
Scarcely could you fancy that as gleam
Could break from out those languid eyes,''

was rapid and delightful. His heavy losses were not forgotten; but
while he meditated beneath the bright arch of heaven on the mother
and the brother he had so fondly loved, there were so many sublime

TEE LIRE AD ADVENTURE
and in truth, his next appearance, unstained skin, and free sunshine-
ing eye, very naturally suggested the idea that he could have no busi-
ness there.
Is Mr. Parsons within'' said Michael boldly, and during the in-
query as much because he knew not what to say, as from any deliberate
resolution to do so.
 Yes,'' replied the man; `` he is about the place somewhere, I see
him not more than ten minutes ago.''
Michael nodded his head, and walked through the gate into the
court, across which he had passed in trembling a thousand times.
Nor was he now quite free from a slight feeling of alarm at the idea of
meeting the sharp eyes of his former terrible taskmaster, and felt
much inclined to blame himself for the curious severity which had
brought him so nearly within his gripe. But it was toole to retreat,
for at the distance of a dozen yards he saw Parsons before him, coming
forth from the building into the court. On seeing the stranger he im-
mediately approached him; Michael touched his hat.
 What may your business here be, young man?'' said Parsons eye-
in him from top to toe.
tI called in, sir, to inquire whether you happened to want a spin-
ner, and what the wages may be,'' said Michael.
 In it for yourself?'' demanded Parsons, knitting his brows, and
looking at him with a sort of incredulous sneer.
 WHy, no sir, it is for a kinsman who happens to be out of em-
ploy,'' replied Michael, colouring from the unusual consciousness of
deceit, and from the same case casting his eyes upon the ground,
thereby displaying the remarkable length of his black eyelashes, and
giving to his whole countenance a look much more resembling that of
former days, than he had worn when he first entered.
Parsons looked at him with a sort of vague idea that he had seen
him before.
 WHere do you come from'' said he.
 From WVestmorland, sir. I have been living in service there for
these four years past.''
And pray what may your name be 2''
 Robert Thornton, sir,'' replied Michael, blushing again, as he
thus unceremoniously borrowed the appellation of his worthy master.
HAve you ever worked in a factory yourself?''
 Yes, sir, 1 have, when I was a boy,'' said Michael, from mere
want of skill and hardwood in the art of lying.
aNd you think you have betterel yourself, I suppose, with your
fine buff waistcoat, and the rest of it. No we don't want no spinner
here,''
MIchael by no means unwillingly obeyed this dismissal, and walked
away, more than half ashamed of his achievement.
I 1 didn't know that Michael Armstrong was dead, I should swear
that there cap was him,'' said a girl somewhat older than our
prudent masquerade, and who had been watching him very earn-
estly during the foregoing conversation. The observation was not
or MICHAEL ARMSTRONG.

addressed to the overlook, but to another girl, who had brought the
speaker her dinner to prevent her leaving some particular work on
which she was employed.
 WHat's that you say, Sykes?'' said Parsons, turning quickly to-
wards her,
2I was saying, sir, as that boy was unaccountable like Michael
Armstrong, as used to live in mother's back-kitchen. He wasn't
above a year or two younger than me, and I knowed him as well as I
did my own brothers.''
``Stuff and nonsense, girl All the world knows that young rascal
ied years ago: and fuss enough there was made about it by that
mad miss at Milford, who I suppose, found out that she was their
cousin, or something of the sort, for she took it so to heart, that she
sold her house and lands, and ran away with another of 'me to some
foreign country, for fear he should die too. Sure you must mind all
that queer story ?'
 Yes, sir,'' replied the girl; `'I remember it right well, and that's
the reason why I says that I know it can't be him.''
` Yet upon my soul, now you mention it, he was the very image of
him. I fancied as I looked at him that sure-ly 1I had seen him some-
were before. But it can't be-a dead dog is deal, all the world
over,''
 Yes sure, sir,'' responded Kitty Sykes, who being what is called a
very sightly girl, was not infrequently indulged with a little conde-
spending notice from Mr. Parsons.  ut 'was his queer curly black
hair. and his particular-looking eyes as put it into my head.''
And if you go on talking of it, Sykes, in that way, you will be
putting it into my head too. And after all, there is nothing so very
impossible in it. Nobody in these parts could really know much
about it, you see, and there's no reason, as I can tell, why the scamp
might not have run away from the Deep - that is, the stocking-
weaver's manufactory as he was sent 'prentice to, and they as ought to
have stopped him, might have given out that he was dead,'' replied
the overlooked.
`Then if it was possible,'' resumed Kitty Sykes,I wouldn't mind
taking my bodily oath that that there young fellow was Michael Arm-
strong, and nobody else,''
 Egal, I wish I hadn't let him go.'' cried Parsons, running to
the gates, ' He was 'printed till twenty-one, and if he has run away,
he's liable to be taken up and put in prison, by the first as catches
him,''
Kitty Sykes took the liberty of running to the gates also; but to say
he truth, she had no wish at all that Mr. Parsons should catch him
up, and put him into prison. The girl, though she had prudence
enough not to communicate the opinion to her friend Mr. Parsons,
thought the stranger by far the handsomest young fellow she had
ever seen, and secretly determined. if she could catch sight of him
again, that she would give him a hint to keep clear of his old acquainted-
anCE.
a1o
TRE LIF AND ADVENtURES
 There he goes,'' cried Parsons, watching Michael, as with upright
gait, and rapid strides, he was pursuing his way by the well-reem-
bored path, which lcl from the factory to Dowsling Lodge.  There
he goes He don't look like one of the mill-people any way-and
yet the fellow said that he had worked in a factory. Didn't you hear
him, Kiuy2
 Yes, sir,'' replied the girl, ` and it was just then as I felt so un-
accountable sure that, unless it was out and out impossible, it must be
Michael Armstrong as was speaking. I never did see such eyes a
Michael's, no such hair neither,.''
``And there he goes, Ill et a sovereign,'' rejoined the overlooked, ``to
take a look at his old quarters at the Lodge. Kitty, I'll give you a
glass of in and a shilling, if you'll ran ater him-you can run like a
have, I know-run and bring him back, KItty, there's a darling, and
say as I have got some good news to tell him.''
Off started the girl with right good-will, having her own reasons for
wishing to do the errand, as well as a very sufficient inclination to gain
the promised reward.
Mr., Parsons by no means over-rated her running powers: and had
she been less fleet, she would have failed in her object, for Michael
walked briskly, and without any inclination to remain longer in the
vicinity of the mill, though by no means conscious that he had been
recognised.
He had just turned the corner of a hedge when the girl overtook
him, so that their colloquy did not take place within sight of the over-
looked
Michael heard the fair Kitty's approach, and turned to see who it
was that thus came galloping and panting after him.
 Do you want me, young woman?'' said he, civilly stopping for
her.
e Well then, you are no changelingI'' replied the girl,. laing
her hand on his arm; '' you were always out-and-out, the activist
boy in the mill''
A very bright diffusion dyed the clear brown of Michael's cheek as
he heard this,
 I do not know what you mean1'' he replied.
 Come, come, michael Armstrong,'' rejoined Kitty, `` you needn't
be afraid of me. Don't you remember Kitty Sykes, as have gone to
and from the mill with you and Teddy, a hundred and a hundred
times ?''
Is it indeed Kitty yes, grown into such a handsome young
woman 2'' said Michael, holding out his hand to her, and feeling quite
incapable of preserving his incognito, in the presence of so old an ac-
distance. ` And to think of your knowing me, Kitty1 But you
must not betray me, my dear girl. If I was found out for Michael
Armstrong, I might get into a scrape.''
`And that's true, and no lie,'' answered the faithless ambassadors,
` for I am sent after you by that old beast Parsons, to tell you to come
back, because he had good news for you. But his nes would just

 Then what sort of names, my good Iad, do you suppose will sup-
port this petition. Do you think the gret mill-owners will sign it?
-Do you think such men as Sir Matthew Dowling for instance, whom
you may have heard spoken of, dow at Ashleigh, maybe, do you think
it will be such as he, whose first object in life is to get as many hours
of labour out of the little creatures that work for him, as strips can
make them give, do you think it will be such as he, that will sign the
ten hours bill ''
Not if that bill is either to hurt himself, or better the children, I
should think,'' said Michael.
True enough,'' replied his new acquaintance, '` and not only is
that true, but he and the like of him will do all that mortal men can,
to prevent all others for signing it. But Heaven forbid tliey should
succeed, young man--for if they do, the best hope of many thousand
suffering, and most helpless human beings, will fall to the ground I''
 Then, indeed, may Heaven forbid that they should have their willI''
returned Michael, fervently.  When is this meeting to take place?''
he added, turning his eyes again to the papers he still held in his hand.
 But three days hence--truly I should like to witness it ''
' Is there any reason against your doing it?'' demanded the strain-
ger.  All your services be wanted by your master before that
time2
 He won't expect me, till two or three days after it,'' replied
MIchael; I have done all I wanted-at least I have stayed as long
as I wished at Ashleigh, and I don't see any great harm there would be
in witnessing the meeting.''
Do see it, my good lad I' said the stranger;  1 predict that it
will offer a spectacle such as never was witnessed before, and most
likely never will, or can be seen.,again. A multitude, probably amount-
in to above a hundred thousand overworked operatives, will meet in
peace and good order, to petition to legal relief from the oppression of
n system which has brought them to a lower state of degradation and
misery than any to which human beings have ever been brought be-
fore,  Were those in whom these poor people have confidence, less
deeply anxious to preserve the public peace than they are, a different
mode of redress might be sought for. But as it is, an honest man
may venture to advise such a respectable young follow as you seem to be,
to stretch your good master's leave a little, in order to be present at
this great spectacle,''
A good deal more conversation followed on the same theme, and
are Michael had ceased to listen to his companion, he felt convinced
that duty as well as inclination would lead him to do all that a loyal
subject and peaceable citizen could, in aid of the suffering class from
whose ranks he had so miraculously escaped. In a word, Michael
Armstrong determined to attend the great Yorkshire meeting, and hold
up his hand for the ten hours bill.
The extraordinary circumstances attending that enormous meeting;
the aunaccountable disappointments which at every halting-place at-
tended all the precautionary efforts of the committee to procure bread'

feeling.  :I fell another hands of the best man and the best master
that ever a wretched runaway hit upon.''
 I almost wonder at you then venturing to come within sight of
your own place again. You can't be one-and-twenty yet by your
looks, and you would not over-well like to work out your time in a
factory, I should think,'' said the other.
I don't think i should,'' replied Michael, laughing; ``and I have
run some risk, I promise you, already, of thevery thing you talk of, since
I left my master's house. Nothing would content my foolish fancy for
calling back old times, but going to look at the very factory where 1
first worked, and talking to the identical tyrant who tortured me
there.''
`But he did not know you, I hope?'' said the old man.
I can hardly say thathe did not,'' replied Michael;  for some na-
tion or other came into his head, and after I left him he sent for me
to come back again. It was, however, by a friendly messenger who
knew well enough who I was, and gave me pretty plainly to understand
which way I had better walk-and that was good luck again. But I
was sorry, too, to have to turn away from the old place without learn-
in any news of my former acquaintance. I found the same over-
looked at Sir Matthew Dowling's mill, and that was all I could find
out.'
S Mathew Dowling's mill at Ashleigh? that's my country,
too. My wife keeps a school at Milford,'' replied the man, `` and we
have heard enough of Sir Matthew.''
cAn you tell me any thing about his daughter Martha2'' de-
wanted Michael, with the appearance of being greatly interested in
the inquiry.  She was very kind to me, and I loved her next best,
I think, to my own dear mother and brother. Do you happen to
know any thing about her ?''
 Not just at present,'' replied the man; `` though they do say,
that all the family are likely to have a downfall, owing to Sir Iat-
the's getting into a scrape about bad bills, or something other,
t'other side of the water. ButI do well remember something particular
about Miss Martha that you talk of, a matter of seven years ago; and
if she was good to you, it was more than she was to every body. for it
was all along of a cruel piece of treachery of her, that I lost the best
mistress that ever man had. I dare say, if you come from Ashleigh,
you must know the name of iss Brotherton, though it's long since
she left MIlford. I was her coaching, and if it had not been for
Miss Martha Dowling, I believe I might have been so still,'
I was but just turned ten years old, at the time I knew MIss
Martha,'' returned Michael;  but I shouldn't have thought she could
be treacherous any body.''
She was though, for all our people knew thewhole story from
first to last, and a queer story it was too, when one thinks of the end
of it; which was neither more nor less than sending our dear young
lady away out of the country.''
 Never happened to know any thing about the lady who owned the

you at a pinch, if you should happen to have needed me. And here,
Michael Armstrong, are the sovereigns, that I give you to keep for
two reasons. One is, that you may use them in case you have need,
The other, that if you don't want them, I shall be sure to see you,
when you bring them back, and that you will go, or OIl never trust a
las Ice most: ad e good bye. I is but a swedish sort of boys
trick though, setting off this way at night, when you ought to be in
bed,'
 The air and the walk will do me more good than all the beds in
the world:'' replied Michael.  God bless you, sir. Sce me to
shall, if I continue to live;'' and so saying, he strode forth into the
night, with a longing for greater space to breathe in, than could be
found in the kitchen of the Royal-oak.
The boy was right as to the effect which this bodily exertion would
produce upon him. The very darkness calmed him; he took his hit
off that the cool air might battle his temples with its deny breath;
and though his pace was rapid, and scarcely relaxed for a moment
during many miles, the action of his pulse became more healthy, and
the aching of his throbbing temples passed away-
All he now seemed to fear was that his imagination should cheat
him into the persuasion that all he wished was true. Edward l
Fanny 1 (for of her identity with Miss Brotherton's protege he could
hardly doubt, when he remembered the history of her departure from
the deep Valley)-these names seemed to king in his ears, and to be
inscribed in starlight on the heavens as he raised his eyes towards
them. And thus the sixteen miles were traversed before he had half
chewed the end of all the sweet thoughts that thronged upon his
fancy. When he reached Fairly, it was still much to early to find
any one stirring, so Michael unceremoniously walked into a cart-
shed, and clamhering up into a vehicle that had the sweet savour of
newly-carried hay to recommend it, he placed his bundle under his
head, and despite both hopes and fears, fell into a sound sleep, nor
wake till cocks, hens, news, p's, and ploughboys, all joined in
chorus to arouse him.

caNAL's first recollections on opening his eyes were not of the
clearest kind, and it requires at least a minute's looking about him.
after seating himself upright in the cart, before he could perfectly
understand where he was, or why and how he got there. Dut no
sooner did all the events of the day before rush back upon his mind,

to MICHAEL ARMsTRoNG.
323
tain-braced Westmorland shepherd, lay extended on a. sofa, with
essenees at his nose. and the opening of his dark eyes watched for, as
tenderly as if he had been a delicate young lady.
A deep-drawn sigh announced to Mr. Bell, who stood by, anxiously
watching him, that his remedies had been successful, that the boy so
long mourned as dead, was really and truly alive, and a very hand-
some, well-grown fellow into the bargain.
 This is a strange history, Michael, as ever I chanced to hear,''
said he, taking the boy's hand, and ascertaining that his pulse again
made ` healthier music.' ee WHy we have all been mourning for you
as dead for this many a year, and now you drop down, as if from the
clouds, and by what i can make out, have been fancying on your
side that Edward was dead too. The first thing to do, must, I think,
be to give you some breakfast, and then, if you are strong enough,
you shall tell me how all this has come to pass,''
Full as his heart was, and eagerly as he longed for the conversation
in which he had so much to learn, as well as to tell, MIchael grate-
fully submitted to this arrangement, till having received from the
hands of the deeply-interested Mrs, Bell herself the refreshment he
so greatly needed, he felt his young strength return, and if he
trembled as he turned his eyes towards his kind host, with a look that
seemed to say,  Now, sir, I can talk to you,'' it was from eager-
ness, not weakness.
MIr. Bell understood the appeal, and well inclined to answer it, said,
Having told you that Edward is alive and well, my dear boy, and
only wants the sight that I see now to make him perfectly happy, I
think you ought to be satisfied, and not expect me to tell you any
more till my curiosity is gratified by hearing your own history. How
in seaworld did it happen, Michael, that when Miss Brotherton went
to the Deep Valley Mills, on purpose to look for you, she should come
back persuaded that you were dead, though the charming little girl
she brought away with her had seen you there, and seemed to know
you well2'
Michael Armstrong told his own story more succinctly than I have
been able to do it, and probably much better too; for he heguiled Mrs.
I3all of many tears as she listened to him; and are as the sad barra-
tive was of events, her husband also hung on every word of it, as
if, contrary to the theory which seemed to be pretty generally esta-
listed in his neighbourhood, he thought the feelings and the suffer-
ings of a factory-child might be capable of exciting interest.
When the history had reached its conclusion, and Michael had
fairly brought himself into Mr. Bell's breakfast-parlour, he paused,
and with a very eloquent look of entreaty said,  Now, sir, may I not
listen to you?'
Yes, my dear boy,'' replied his new friend, in the happy tono with
which a kind heart inspires words calculated to give pleasure.  Yes,
you have much to hear, and a wonderful story it is, I promise to.
But it shall be all true Michael, so don't fancy that I am telling you a
fairy tale, and that Miss Drotherton is the fairy. bUt first tell me, be-

fore I go any further, what sort of a boy was your brother Edward
when you saw him last ?''
Oh, sir1 he was the dearest, kindest fellow that ever lived 1'' re-
plied Michael, his firie eyes beaming with tenderness and well-reem-
breed love.
 But what sort of a boy was he to look at?'' demanded the
clergyman.
Michael closed his eyes as if the better to contemplate the inward
picture engraved on his memory.
e His face was a sweet face,'' said he, ' but his dear limbs were
crippled. HE was a lighter boy than me, and could not' stand the
labour of the mill; and I fear-I fear,'' he added, shuddering, ` that
my poor Edward must live and die a cripple.''
What is your opinion about that, my dear?'' said Mr. Bell, turn-
;;;aveeeeem-
cult in identifying his brother when he gets to him,'' she replied.
Instead of being a cripple,'' resumed MIr, Bell,  I suspect that
your brother is a handsome fellow than you are, Michael. Every
thing promised well for it when he took leave of us, and since then
my wife has had letters from Miss Brotherton, which do not speak of
any falling off in his improvement.'
 Nay,'' said the lady,I have had more than letters to speak of
it. Shall I show him Miss Brotherton's drawing, George ?'
 MOst certainly, my dear; it will save me a vast deal of script-
tion, and you may trust to Miss Brotherton's pencil, Michael, as im-
publicly as to my words, for there never was a more faithful linear,''
Mars. Bell the opened a little portfolio, secured by a key, and drew
thence a drawing in water-colours, the composition and finish of which
would have done no discredit to a professional artist. How the stout
nerves of the young and athletic Michael trembled as he received it
At first his eyes seemed to fail him, the outline, the colouring, the
whole group was indistinct. I am a fool, sirI'' he said, letting the
hand that held it drop beside him:`' I positively cannot see.''
1 don't much wonder at it,'' replied Mlr. Bell; `` but try again,
MIchael, it is worth looking at.''
And so thought Michael, as he once more placed it before him, and
gazed upon it with an eye as eager as that of Surrey might have been,
hen contemplating the magic mirror that was to show him what he
loved ` in life and limb,'' The drawing represented a terrace-walk,
along which ran a handsome stone balustrade partially covered by
vine-leaves; while beneath it in the distance, stretched to a far horn-
on a glorious river, careering through a rich and varied landscape.
All this was fair to look upon, but the boy's eyes saw it not-they
were riveted upon two figures that occupied the foreground of the
terrace. One of these was a slender girl, whose bright curls seemed
just released from the restraint of a straw-hat which she held in her
and. BUt though the hal was thus uncovered, the features were

ot visible, for the other hand was placed upon the balustrale, over
which she hung, as if in earnest contemplation of some object below.
But the head of the other figure, a young man of some twenty years
or so, was so tuned as fully to meet the spectator's eye: and if the
pencil that drew it flattered not, it was one of the handsomest that
nature ever formed. The large expressive eyes, beaming with mingled
softness and animation, were directed to some object out of the pic-
were, but at no great distance; for the sweet smile that played about
the mouth seemed to indicate that he was listening to pleasant words
from some well-loved companion. The figure of the young man thus
represented, was tall and graceful. His dress was the light summer
garb of a southern climate-an open hook was in his hand, his straw
hat lay at his feet, beside which stood a basket of newly-gathered
geNes, and a small Italian greyhound, its bright eye looking in the
same direction as his own, completed the group, which spoke in every
part of it a sort of graceful ease and enjoyment, that it was very plea-
want to look upon.
In this indeed e my Edward2'' said Michael at length, fter a
Long silent examination of the drawing. `How beautiful -how
noble l-how happy-hw healthful-how intelligent he looks? Is it
my own dear, pale, sickly brother? Can this be true2''
`As true as that you stand there to look at it,'' replied Mr. Bell,
 Is there nothing in the face, Michael, that recalls your brother to
you?'
'es, sir,'' he replied quickly;  the eyes and the sweet smile are
so like my own Edward, that strange as it is to see him so healthy,
tall, and graceful as he is represented here, and looking, too, so greatly
like a gentleman, I do quite believe that this was never drawn for any
one but him; for never, never since I saw him last, have lI seen such
eyes, or such a smile as that.''
 Yon are quite right there, Michael. The face is one not easily
forgotten, and I can trace i here, notwithstanding all the change of age
and circumstance. But who do you think that slender girl may be
a seems a pity not to see the face; the form, the pretty attitude, the
bright waving locks, all plainly tell that it must be worth looking at.
Can you guess who it is ?''
`Suppose it is Fanny Fletcher,'' replica Michael, colouring
` And there, too, you are quite right. But does it not puzzle you
to think how all this has been brought about? How does it happen,
think you, that those whom you remember in a state so different,
should now be living as you see them here, looking as if their exist-
ence were made up of sunshine and sweet air ?''
And now again I shall answer, as they say the fortune-tellers do,''
replied Michael, smiling, ' by telling you, sir, what you have before
told me. It is Miss robertson, whose name I well remember at
Dowling Lodge, it is she who has done all this, and may God bless hen
for it  But act, truly, it still seems a mystery. How did it have

my having advanced in the precious labour of making these two be-
loved beings happier. Were they merely ordinary yeung people, with
average hearts and average capacities, I should still bless Ileaven with
a grateful heart, for having permitted me to be the means of changing
their condition, from one of great suffering to a life of innocent enjoy-
ment. But as it is, 1 know not how to be thankful enough
It seems to me, dear friends, however much I increase my ac-
acquaintance with other human beings, that Edward and Fanny are
the noblest creatures in the world. Is it that suffering, being of ne-
obesity a part of our earthly nature, we cannot arrive at the perfect
development of all our faculties without it 2 Where it arrives in later
life, perhaps, the effect, though inwardly healthful, may not show
fruits so beautiful. There is in the minds of both of them, a bright-
ness of intelligence, and a delicious calm of temper that I have never
met elsewhere. It is as if a heavy weight that had been painfully
crushing them, was suddenly removed, causing all the ordinary sen-
nations of human existence to be felt as a luxury. oung as they
are, they are full of instruction, right thinking, pure feeling, and
a firmness of integrity which it is the best joy of my life to conte-
plate-and all this built on so firm a foundation of religious principle,
that I can have no fears for its endurance. After this, it would be
very weak and womanish folly to dwell much on their personal adnan-
tages, or even on the peculiar charm of their manners and converse-
tion-yet they are gifts which bring a charm, to which itis difficult to
be quite insensible.
`Is it not strange, dear friends, that being such as I describe them,
and having passed so large a portion of their lives together in the u-
dual contemplation of each other's excellence, is it not strange that
they should not by this time be lovers, instead of friends ? Deutsch is not
the case. That they love each other sincerely is most true, and I could
give a thousand proofs that either would at all times gladly renounce
element or pleasure of any kind, for the sake of the other; but
they are not in love. If I did not believe it impossible, considering
the age of the parties when they parted, I should think that Fanny's
little heart had been buried in the grave of MIchael, the poor little
fellow, whose early sufferings under the tender patronage of Sir Mat-.
the Dowling, first rouscd my sleepy existence into action. She can-
not yet hear his name mentioned, without betraying a degree of emo-
tion that it is painful to witness; and when, as sometimes happens,
Edward is taken for her brother, it seems to delight hcr.  Yes, yes.

he will tell you that I am to him a year and loving sister,' I have

have answered, and truly too, in the same strain.
 Edward is now twenty-one, and my pretty Fanny nineteen: but,
notwithstanding the variety of captivating young people with whom
they are perpetually associating, I cannot believe that the heart of
either has as yet received any .tender impression-though in more

nance, and his hand trembled as he stretched it forth to receive that
which was kindly extended towards him.
 You have remained too long alone. my dear boy, in this cold
nock,'' said MIr. Bell, taking the young man's arm within his own,
and Leading him towards the house. : What makes you look so pale,
Michael? you are not all, I hope?''
 No, sir, I think not,'' was the reply. ` but I can hardly tell you
how I feel. At one moment the idea that my lear brother still lives,
and that it is possible lI may again see him, hear him, hold him in my
arms, seems to make me too happy to breathe-and then again, a
sort of doubt and sadness takes hold upon me, and i do not feel as
if it were possible I could ever make one in the happy party on the
terrace.''
And why not, Michael?'' demanded Mr. Bell somewhat reproach-
fully; ``after reading that letter, can you find it in your heart to doubt
that the party on the terrace would receive you joyfully 2'
 IiI1 not the happiness be too great'' cried Michael.  Oh1 how
can i deserve it''
Not by doubting the goodness or the affection of those who love
you,'' replied Mr. Bell. `But come, I must not preach to you now,
I believe, for I suspect that you are not in a condition to profit by it.
Come into the house, sit down, and grow reasonable as fast as you
can, and then we will talk of the time and the mode in which you
must set off to join your family-for your family they are, and will
be, Michael, on may depend upon it,''
Can I throw myself upon Miss Brotherton, sir, without her per-
mission ?'' demanded Michael, while his paleess was changed for a
moment into a glow of the deepest red.
I am afraid you have a very proud heart, Michael,'' said Mr. Bell,
looking at him: ` and that is not right, it is not chistianlike.''
Oh, Mr. Bell1'' replied Michael, with strong feeling, `` have I not
already eaten the bitter bread of dependence, and can I, at my age,
and with my power to labour, submit to it again ''
 You have a notion then, yang man, that benefits conferred by
a Sir Matthew Dowling, and a Miss Brotherton, are the same thing ?''
said MIr. Bell.
Not so, sir,'' replied Michael,  I cannot doubt that she who
wrote this letter, must be both great and good, and I well know that
Sir Matthew Dowling was neither. But I only know Miss Brotherton
as one of the fine folks visiting at his house, and I cannot feel that
i should like to start out suddenly upon her. from the tomb, as it
would seem, appearing to expect that she should adopt me too, as she
has done my brother Edward.''
 Well, Michael, I must not blame you for this, because I believe
it is very natural; yet, nevertheless, I feel quite sure that you will
forget all such notions when you see Miss Brotherton,'' returned
Mr. Bell, smiling. Michael shook his head, but he returned the
smile, though rather languidly; and when they had reached the house,

and were again seated in the study, he said, : that does Miss
Brotherton mean, sir, by calling Miss Martha Dowling ` poor martha.'
I trust that no misfortune has fallen her? she was very kind to me,
and I shall always love her, although her name is Dowling.''
1 believe she deserves it, mIchael,'' returned Mr. Bell, ``and,
by the by, you have it in your power to show your love, and do her
a great kindness by the very simple process of letting her know that
you are alive. Poor girl: She has suffered dreadfully from believing
that she caused your death by the advice she gave to your mother
about signing your indentures, and I fancy that letting her know that
you did not perish in consequence, would be conferring a real blessing
on her,''
Dear, good Miss Martha:'' exclaimed Michael, ` how well do 1
remember the walk we took together when she went to Huxley-lane,
to give my dearest mother that advice. She did it for my good, and
for my good it would have been, if what she advised had been the
thing she thought it I owe her still, notwithstanding the misery she
brought me to, the deepest gratitude; for her kind and careful calling
during the short time i1 was in her father's house first gave me the
ambition and the hope to learn, and, spite of my degraded condition,
I have ever lost sight of it-and this it is, which, if any thing can,
may reconcile me to presenting myself as a poor shepherd-boy before
my well-taught brother.'
You are right there, MIchael,'' replied Mr. Bell; " it is very clear
to me that you have profited greatly by the feelings so inspired., not-
withstanding the adverse circumstances in which you were placed
during the four terrible years passed in the Deep Valley; and such
feelings I can tell you, will make a vast difference in the degree of
happiness you are likely to enjoy in a reunion with your brother.''
 And to Fanny Fletcher tool'' said Michael, with the cagerness of
reviving hope heightening his colour, and darting its brightness from
his eye,-'`to any Fletcher too, I owe the suggestion of thoughts
which have saved me from being too utterly degraded to meet her
again with pleasure. It is to Martha Dowling., surely, that I owe all
the little book planning I have been able to acquire, as well as the
power of writing down the thoughts and meditations to which it has
give rise; but it was Fanny who made me feel that however lowly
our condition and state on earth, we may yet retain as good a right
as any of the kings of it, to open our hearts before God, and ask for
His Spirit to help us. IIow many mornings have I watched the sun
risc, how many evenings have I seen him set in glory behind the
mountain-tops, arid thought as lI lay amidst the weather, and for-
shipped his ALmighty Maker, that, but for her, I should never have
known the comfort of loving and trusting, as well as of adoring him.
It was that dear patient little girl who taught me this, and perhaps I
may yet live to thank her for it.''
1 rust you will, my dear boy,'' replied Mr, Bell, touched with the
earnestenergy of the boy's manner;`` 1 trust you will, Michael: and if

reward for all the pains she took to comfort you. Such kindness as
she showed you is, indeed,

It hlesseth him that liNes, and him that takes:'
and I doubt not that the, as well as yourself, has been the better for
it, from that time to this.''
MIa I look once more at that drawing, sir?'' said Michael, with
some little embarrassment.
 There it is, Michael,'' said the clergyman smiling, and once more
laing it before him.  WEre it not that I think you will so soon see
the dear originals, and that we shall not, I would ask my wife to give
it you.''
I think I shall learn every line, and every shale of it by rote,''
said Michael, if I do but look at it a few minutes longer. There,
sir,'' he added, after an earnest gaze, and resigning it into his hands:

seemed to rouse himself; and, as if endeavouring to shake off some
feeling that oppressed lim, he said, ` But you have not told me yet,
sir, the reason why MIss Brotherton calls my first benefactors ` poor
Martha' 
I am sorry to say,'' replied MIr. Bell, ` that there are more reasons
than one, for applying that pityiag epithet to Miss Martha Dowling.
In the first place she is greatly out of health, poor gil: and in the
next, her father's affairs are said to be in a very tottering condition, in
consequence of his having overloaded himself with a greater quantity of
spun cotton than he can get any sale for. He is said to have lent out
money, to, on some speculation which has not answered: and, in short,
that it is rather a nice question, whether he will be able to get through
his difficulties or not. Another misfortune is, that Sir Matthew, as
soon as he possibly could after the death of his first wife, thought proper
to marry the day Clarissa Sharpton who, strange to say, thought
proper also to marry him: and it is said also, that poor Miss Martha,
who is the eldest of the daughters unmarried, is not permitted to enjoy
much peace under the rule of her noble step-mother,''
Lady Clarissa Sharpton?'' said Michael, with the air of one to
whom some long-lost image is brought back-`` LAdy Clarissa Shrimp-
ton 2 Why, surely, that was the name of the tall, thin woman who
had to practise the laying her bony hand upon my unfortunate little
head, when the terrible play was about:''
I dare say it was,'' said MIr. Bell,  But, at any rate, Lady
Clarissa fihrimplon is now Lady Clarissa Dowling.''
Poor Miss Martha I-and she is out of health too? How can 1
manage to pay my duty to her, Mlr. Bell, without running the risk of
being recognised by Sir Matthew, as the unfortunate boy who escaped
from the dEep Valley? He would be able, I suppose, to make me
serve out to time?''
I do not think he would attempt it just now, Michael ?'' was the
consolation reply. s Thank God ?I'' continued Mr. Bell, `` there has
been a good deal said of late concerning the abominations of the
334

Deep Valley Factory, and I don't much think Sir Matthew Dowling
would run the risk of having it proved that he had kidnapped a boy
away to it, in the style he managed you. I should have no fear
whatever, of your presenting yourself at Dowling Lodge: only I
think it is ten to one her ladyship will not let you get a sight of Miss
Martha without her being present,-unless you were to write a line to
the young lady first, and then perhaps she might contrive it.''
Michael now rose to take his leave, offering with a fervour that was
very touching, his earnest thanks for the generous kindness with
which he had been received ; but he resisted all the hospitable efforts
made to retain him as a guest. He had need, he said, to be alone,
that he might bring his mind to such a state as should enable him to
sustain the wonderful change in his prospects with something like
fortitude and rational composure. There was more real kindness, and
true sympathy, in the manner of accepting this excuse, than the
most pressing offers of hospitality could have shown: and mIchael,
after involuntarily kissing the hand stretched out to bid him farewell
took his departure from the clergyman's house, with a heart full of
thankfulness to God and man.
cHAPTER XXIX.
MICHAEL CAL III3 I3DOI r0 CECIL, AND TIE ITS To E
gcssED PoLE TIIM-A EARLY ALL-A OLD FIELD
WITH A CHANGED PACE.
To describe Michael Armstrong's feeling as he took his solitary way
along what seemed to him the most unfrequented fields he could find,
would be both a difficult and an unnecessary task. That his heart
swelled with thankfulness and joy cannot be doubted; yet thcrc was a
vagueness and uncertainty as to what he ought immediately to do,
which made him anxious and said, even in the midst of hope and joy.
The small sum he had been able to save from his wages had been
spent, or very nearly so, since he set out upon his eventful expedition.
He had already accepted a loan from the friendly old cochran of
Miss Brotherton, and he shrunk from the idea of contracting more
debts, while unable to say with certainty when they should be paid.
How then was he to reach his brother in his happy distant home
And where and how was he to pass the anxious interval that most of
necessity intervene before he could even know to what point he should
direct his pilgrim steps, even had he the means of setting forth2
The path he had taken proved to be a shore cut leading into the high-
road from Fairly to Ashleigh, and on quitting the fields he found
himself close to the door of a public-house which he was tempted to
select for his shelter as long as he remained in the neighbourhood,
both because it was lonely, and because it was humble. Having en-
tered there, bespoke a bed, and make a very frugal repast, he

inquired the distance to Dowling Lodge, and finding it was greater
than he could traverse on foot with any hope of returning in decent
time to occupy his newly-taken lodging, he resolved to wait till the
following morning, when, by setting off at daybreak, he might be able
to make his visit to Martha, and perhaps report the result of it to
MIr. Bell, before he slept.
His mind had too much on which to employ itself for him to feel
the afternoon a long one: an orchard close behind the little inn,
afforded him shade and soft turf wherein to sit or lie, or to page back-
wards and forwards, with unequal steps, as he meditatedt on the
chances for and against his ever being one in the happy, thrice happy
party described by Miss Brotherton. Nor had he wearied of these
exciting, but most anxious thoughts, when the moon, and the stars,
and the heavy dew warned him at length that the day was gone, and
night come. And then he remembered that, in order to follow Mr.,
Bell's advice, he must prepare himself with a letter to Miss Martha,
which it would be necessary to write before he went to bed. Fort-
namely his hotel was able to furnish the needful implements, and after
a little reflection, he penned the following note:
A poor had, to whom Miss Martha Dowling once showed much
charitable kindness, is now waiting at the park-gates, to know if he
may pay his duty to her. He takes the freedom of asking for this
favour, because he has been told that she would be pleased to hear
he was alive and well.'' Having directed this to Miss Martha Dow-
ling, and sealed it in the best manner he could, he retired to his little
bed in a state of mind that hovered between inexpressible felicity, and
anxiety that he was hardly able to bear.
He was afoot in time to hear the park's first overture on the following
morning; and his spirits, cheered by the bracing influence of the
delicious hour, and by the sound sleep which had preceded it, en-
able him to breakfast on a slice of brown bread, bespoke the night
before, and laid realy for him, with a draught of icy-cold water from
a neighbouring well, without any mixture of melancholy, though he
thought the while of all the dangers and difficulties he might have to
encounter ere he stood beside his Edward on the beautiful terrace
to which his dreams had transported him so easily.
Michael was a stout walker, and had reached the well-remembered
precincts of Dowling Lodge soon after the earliest servants were
stirring. Ile had made up his mind to be the bearer of his own
letter, and accordingly, having shown the address to the woman at
the lodge as a reason for being permitted to enter, he approached the
stately mansion by the road which led to the offices, and entrusting
his epistle to the first female he encountered, requested her to deliver
it to Miss MArtha without delay.
WHy she hean't up yet,'' said the girl, looking at him, however,
with the good-humoured smile with which light-hearted young dam-
sets are wont to greet such very handsome ads as our Michael.
 But perhaps you will be so good as to let her have it as soon
as she is awake ?'' he replied, returning the smile.
Well, poor thing, and that may be law, most likely,'' returned
s36
THE LIFE AND ADVENTURES
turned the girl, ` for her cough often wakes her before this time-
WiLl you wait for an answer ?''
 I won't trouble the servants by staying here,'' replied Michael:
 but if you please ye may tell the young lady that Will walk 
and down the road will she can let me have it. Does Miss Martha
walk out early in the mornings, as she used to do?'' he added.
tHat's just what she likes best, poor thing,'' replied the girl.  But
you needn't he afeard that she's gone out already; for if she had, a
should have been sure to have seen her; for she never has the great
door opened for her at this time of day, for fear of disturbing my
lady, who always lies unaccountable late.''
'' And does Sir Matthew rise early now ?'' demanded Michael with
some anxiety.
He:-not he: He eats and sleeps like a pig. they say: but he
is grumpier than ever he was, both to men and maids too, since he
married the new lady. I wonder as I never happened to see you
before, as you seem to know 'em all so well,''
 It is several years since I was last here,'' returned Michael; ` but
run up stairs with it, there's a dear girl, will you l because I want to
get my answer and be off,''
You had better stop here till I come down again,'' replied his
good-natured messenger, `` instead of walking up and down the road,
without knowing whether there's an answer or no-sit down in the
kitchen, and I'll be back in no time.''
And into the kitchen he went-the sesame kitchen which just
eight years before had been the scene of his painful examination by
Sir Matthew bOwling's servants. He remembered the room perfectly;
could have pointed out the exact spot where the awful housekeeper
eat, and the place where he had himself stood, with no better champion
to sustain his courage than the greasy kitchen-maid, whose pitying
broad face, bent over him, he reeollected as perfectly as if it had
beamed upon him but the day before. He was still deeply revolving
these interesting reminiscences, and the strange contrast they offered
to his present hopes, when his envoy returned- MIss Martha wants
to know your name, yost man,'' she said, ` but she is getting up,
and will be walking in the park as usual, she says, presently, so it is
likely enough that she will give you the answer herself,''
 Very well,'' replied MIchael, perfectly satisfied-'`good morning
--I am very much obliged to you.''
But you haven't told me your name, and MIss Martha says that
she should like to know it,''
 MY name isn't one that would make any difference,'' he replied,
"so I wont trouble you to go up again about that-good bye'' And
without waiting for any further discussion, he walked off, exceedingly
well pleased at having arranged the wished for the-i-tate so satisfy-
torily. The noble dimensions of the park enabled MIchael to select
a space amply sufficient for his promenade which was neither within
sight of the mansion nor the lodge, and here he had made many turns
pen it, he perceived the lady he wished to see, approaching him.
He could not doubt that it was Martha, for at that hour of the
or IIGIEIL ARI9TONG.
 33z7
morning none other was at all likely to be there; but she was too
much altered for him to recognise her inany degree. He thought she
was taller than he had expected to see her, but at any rate she was
greatly thinner, and so delicately pale, that her appearance was rather
a contrast, than a resemblance to what he had expected to meet. She
was already near him when he turned upon the path, and met her.
He stopped, took off his hat, and bowed respectfully.
You are Miss Martha Dowling, ma'am 7'' he said interrogatively.
 Yes,'' replied Martha, '` that is my name, but when did I see
you before, young man? I do not know you,''
It is a great many years, Miss Martha-but I can never forget
your kindness.''
The pale cheek of Martha was tinted with a vivid blush, as she ex-
claimed, ` 1If it were possible-if I did not know that he was dead-
But this is nonsense,'' she added, recovering her composure. I
quite forget your person, young man,'' she continued, after a pause:
` But if i have ever done you any service, I am glad of it. Perhaps
if you tell me your name I may remember the circumstances to which
you allude.''
OI Miss Martha'' replied Michael, :I am afraid my name
will startle you, and therefore 1 do not like to speak it. But I think
it came into your head just now, only you stopped short, and said it
was impossible,''
Can it be Michael Armstrong that I see ?'' demanded Martha, in
an agitated voice.
It is indeed, Miss Martha'' he replied, ' It is Michael Arm-
strong, come back to thank you for all your great kindness to him.''
My kindness to Michael Armstrong ?'' she exclaimed.-' Alas
it was I who occasioned all his sufferings, and, as I have thought for
many years, his death. How is it you have been said, Michael ?
How is it you have escaped from the horrid place to which was the
cause of your being sent ?''
 My dear Miss Martha'' returned Michael, greatly affected by her
look of ill-health, and by the agitation she displayed-for tears were
trickling fast down her pale cheeks. e My car Miss Martha,'' he
said,  I know, if nobody else does, the kind motive that you snl for
every word you spoke-and was it not I myself that said I wanted to
go, Miss Martha, when we walked together from here, down to poor
mother's house? Never, never can I thank you enough for all your
goodness then, as well as at all other times, from the very first mo-
ment that ever i saw you 2
 Thank God1'' cried poor Martha, fervently clasping her hands,
and raising her eyes to heaven,`` you know not, Michael, what lond
you have taken from my heart I have for years lived under the
dreadful weight of believing myself to be your murderer. The thought
has haunted me by night, and rarely quieted me by day. And my

Michael could not help thinking-though for worlds he would not
have lessened her pious satisfaction by uttering the thought-that

for it. I was always stronger than Edward, you know, Miss MArtha,
and there is no reason because he lives an idle life, tear fellow, that I
should do so too.''
 Michael ?'' she replied, her whole countenance lighted up with
the most animated expression of pleasure, `' my dear Michael Arm-
strong your coming here is certainly the greatest blessing that
Heaven could have sent me. I cannot tell you, and you can never
know, all I have suffered from believing you were dead, and from
knowing that i had been the cause of great and terrible suffering to
you. And that, too, wholly owing to the trust which you, and your
poor mother reposed in mel May you never, my dear boy, know
what it is to have a conscience burdened as mine has been. Be very
sure that it is worse than any thing you could have suffered at the
Deep Valley, Michael When you see Mary Brotherton, tell her that
I owned this to you-and perhaps she may think, at last, that she
judged me rather more harshly than lI deserved,'
`If she judged you harshly at all, she was very wrong,'' replied
Michael, warmly.  People should know, before theyjudge. No-
boy who really knew you, could judge you harshly,''
 I had rather that kind sentence came from your lips, Michael, than
from those of any other human being. If you can say it, and mean
it too, as I am sure you do, who is there giving that can have a right
to say the contrary? et this is not my only pleasure-i happen to
have the power-and I bless my poor father for it-of making spine
little atonement for the years of suffering that I so unwittingly caused
you. From the day we were each of us fifteen, we have received an
allowance of sixty pounds a year for dress, and though I really never
wanted one-half so much as my sisters, my father, who has ever been
a kind father to me has always insisted upon my having the same, and
at the marriage of my two elder sisters, he gave me a hundred pounds
each time, that I might be smart. But I have no taste for finer,
Michael, it always made me melancholy; so I am very rich-I really.
do not know how rich, for I have always kept on laying the bank-
notes that I did not want in a drawer, and I have never counted them.
Think if it will not be a pleasure for me now to open that drawer, and
give you all that is in it? Oh1 with what different feelings shall go
to bed to-night from and I have felt for years past1 I am sure there
must be enough to take you to Italy, or wherever else Miss Brotherton
may be gone, and to set you up in some little business into the bargain.
Wait here only ten minutes, my dear Michael, and I will return with
my treasure-a real treasure now, and for the first time that I ever
thought it so1'
Martha had risen from her seat as she spoke, and literally before
Michael could recover from his astonishment sufficiently to answer her,
she was already at some distance from him. He had by no means
settled to his satisfaction the question of whether he ought, or ought
not, to strip the generous Martha of her little hoard when she again
appeared, But she looked hurried and out of breath.

of self-reproach from which I have so recently escaped. Take this
parcel, Michael. Nay, never stay to count them MY father has
left his room-may have inquired for me--and even now be following
me. Bless you, Michael Bless you1 To, go, for goodness sake, and
leave the country as quickly as possible.''
WIth these words she turned from him, and with a step too rapid for
her state of health, and plainly showing her extreme anxiety, she
hastily retreated towards the house.
Though after hearing Mr. Bell's decided opinion that no further
danger was to be fired from Sir Matthew Dowling, Michael would
himself have felt not the least desire to run away from him, yet it
was impossible not to perceive that Martha was of a different mind,
and that for some reason or other she was exceedingly anxious
that he should not remain near Dowling Lodge, or, in other words,
within her father's reach. Whether she were right, strong, in
fancying that it was necessary for his safety that he should keep out
of the way, he felt that it would be cruel to oppose her: and with the
unexamined roll of bank-notes thrust into his cot-pocket, he gae
but one farewell look at the retreating drapery of poor MArtha, and
then with rapid strides, and thoughts so full of the scene which had
just passed, that he followed the right path rather mechanically than
from judgment, he set off' upon his return to the humble lodging he
had secured for the night.

III Y OLD ACQUAINTANCES,
Tas morning's walk had been a long one, even for Michael Arm-
strong, and right glad was he to find himself again in the neatly-
san ded kitchen of his little in, with a loaf and cheese before him, of
sufficient dimensions to resist any attacks he could make upon them.
A moderate proportion of beer, in addition to the solid meal these
afforded, refreshed him so eflectually that he determined to take his
leave of MIr. Bell that night, preparatory to setting off on his return
to Westmorland on the following morning, in order to bid farewell
to his good old master there. On the subject of Martha's bank-notes
he meant to be entirely guided by the advice of the clergyman, being
equally fearful of offending, or rather of painting their generous
owner by refusing to accept them, or of depriving her of what might
be hereafter useful, by agreeing to do so.

l have seen Miss MArtha, sir 1'' were his first words on entering
M, Bill's parlour, and both look and accent showed that the inter-
view has been an interesting one. ``But, alas1 she is greatly al-
tercd,'' he added, restraining with difficulty the tears that rose to his
eyes.'' I fear she is very ill ;-but she was glad-oh so glad to see
ne, girl She has been fretting, poor dear young lady, under the
false notion that she had been to blame about me ; but, thank Heavenly
think she knows better now, and perhaps when her mind is at ease
again she may recover health. I can't bear to think how pale and
then she is grown, and all about me, to whom she was the best and
kindest friend that ever poor boy had. And see, sir, what she has
lone now' continued Michael, drawing forth the roll of notes from
his pocket.  Here is a large sum of money, I believe. She did
not rightly know how much it was herself, she told me, because
she had kept on putting by what she did not want, and had never
counted how much it came to-and I'm sure i have not counted it
either; but whether it is little or much, I don't feel quite certain
whether I ought to take it.''
Mr. Bell smiled at the unusual manner in which the rich-looking,
but carelessly-packed roll of paper had passed from one hand to the
other. Before he examined the contents he questioned Michael as to
all that the generous-hearted girl had said to him, on bestowiag it,
and the young man's faithful answers soon convinced him that there
would be little kindness to the self-rcproaching Martha in refusing
nation which she evidently considered as an atonement, and which
would, he doubted not, by its application to Michael's necessities, do
more towards healing her wounded mind than any other thing what-
eYe.
 You must not refuse the gift, Michael,'' said Mr. BEll, after
hearing his narrative to the end.  I o not wonder, little as she has
been to blame in the matter, at her haring suffered greatly for all that
she innocently made you suffer; nor nm I at all surprised, since it was
in her power to do so, that she should wish to make you this atone-
ment. It comes at a lucky moment, my denr boy, for not only will it
enable you to present yourself before Miss Brotherton, without
throwing yourself, as you said yesterday, upon her charity, but I sus-
pest it may go far in assisting your hopes of entering into some busi-
ness, which may enable you to support yourself,''
Mr. Bell then opened the bundle of notes, and found that they
amounted to rather more than five hundred pounds: a sum which,
to Michael, appeared so enormous that he uttered something like a
remnonstrance against the opinion which advised his appropriating the
hole.
Did you not tell me, sir,'' he said, `` that Sir Mathew Dowling's
affairs were not considered to be in so flourishing a state as they had
been? And may not this money be wanted by Miss Martha in case
he should really become involved in difficulties''
I think there is no danger of her wanting it, Michael,'' returned
Mr. Bell, ` Let what will happen, I have no doubt that Sir Matthew

London taken, and all things ready for his setting off, are that he
still expected an answer to a very cautiously-worded epistle which he
had returned to address to Martha, informing her that he was setting
off for Nice, and that any letter or message she might wish to convey
to Miss Brotherton, should be carefully delivered by her faithful
humble servant, M. A.
Michael was at breakfast with his kind and hospitable friends, when
a law, bearing great marks of hasty travelling in his appearance, made
his way into the room, and with a long that seemed to prophesy eventful
timings, if he were but asked for them, delivered a letter to Mr. Bell.
This proved, however, to be only a blank cover, enclosing one to
Michael, which was handed to him, while the eyes of his host and
hostess fixed themselves with some anxiety on his face. Michael tore
open the despatch, and changed colour as be read it. Then, giving
an intelligible glance at the messenger who ceased not to wipe his fore-
heal with one arm, while he held his hat squeeze to his side with
the other, he said, '`I should like to speak to you about this, Mr.
Bell,
Go into the kitchen, my lad,'' said the clergyman,'` and get some
breakfast. You shall know when the answer is ready.''
Though evidently disappointed at being thus dismissed unquestioned,
the boy consoled himself with the hope of a kitchen audience, and
making his reverence, retired.
wHat in the world have you got there, Micha1?' demanded M,
Bell. `' Not good news, I amn afraid 2''
 No, indeed, sir,'' replied Michael, ` very far fromit.' It is from
Miss Martha Dowling, who seems to be in great distress.''
Read it to us, my good fellow, will you? If there is no reason
to the contrary,''
 WHat is written here, sir, cannot long be a secret from any body.
This is what she says:
 Der Michael1
Pray come to me at Dowling Lodge directly. There is no longer
any danger to be feared from my poor denr father, for he is very, very
ill-and I think you can be useful to me, which i am sure you will be
if you can. Alas1 Michael, you will witness a dreadful scene1 My
poor father has kept every thing secret to the very last; meaning, i am
sure, to prepare his family for it as well as he could. I could not
think what it was made him send all my sisters away to Arabella and
Harriet. The two little ones, indeed, as well as the three longest boys,
are all at school, so that I am the only child he has left with him, my
elder brothers being all away in their different professions. I tell you
all this now, Michael, because I shall, I suppose, have no time to say
any thing but on necessary business when you come here. Do not
delay, I am sure you can be useful to me.
In great sorrow, your friend,

THE LIFE AND ADVErUnES
 Poor girl THis is sal indeed' tried Mr. Bell.  I imagine,
though she does not explain herself, that her father's affairs are fallen
into confusion. Yet I cannot guess what you can do for her. How-
eet, you must go immediately of course; and you had better hire a
chaise that no time may be lost. And I would advise you, michael,
to take with on the pocket-book which Mrs. bEll packed up for you
so carefully last night. I fear that it is but too likely for prediction
will be fulfilled already, and that the poor young lady may be glad to
have some of her notes returned,''
 Thank God: that I was not gone,'' replied Michael, fervently.
It will be the greatest pleasure of my life, if I can be useful to
her:
Little time was lost in setting off; and certainly much before his
arrival had been hoped for by MArtha, Michael, who left his post-
chaise at a public-house near the lodge, was walking towards the
mansion by the same path in which he had so lately parted from her.
On entering the kitchen, the scene which met his eyes, explained at
the very first glance the nature of the business carrying on upon the
premises. A number of men were standing about, some few occupied
in sticking slips of paper inscribed ` Lot No.-,'' upon a variety of
articles which appeared to have been collected there for the purpose.
Others, with black canvass aprons and paper caps, were coming and
going with no very apparent purpose; while another set, with cold
meat and beer-wagons before them, sat round a small table in a cot-
ner, discovering upon themes which appeared to occasion them much
mere ment.
Bu t among all these, there was not one that looked like a servant
of the house: and taking advantage of the confusion which seemed to
license the freedom, he walked on without speaking to any of them,
and determined to trust to his memory for finding the small morning-
parlor which used to contain all poor Martha's little literary personal-
ties, and in which all his reading and writing lessons had been re-
edited.
Neither his recollection nor his conjecture deceived him; he found
the apartment he sought, and on opening the door, discovered Martha
sitting there. BUt she was not, as he had hoped to find her, alone.
On a sofa placed opposite the windows at a figure, bolt upright in the
middle of it, with a sofa-table before her entirely covered with tin-
kets, delicate Serve china, miniature bronzes, and other valuable nick-
backs. A quantity of cotton-wool lay on the sofa beside her, and her
long lean fingers were actively employed in selecting the most precious
articles, cnveloping them in the wool, and then cramming them into a
large basket that stood before her,-sometimes selecting one, either
smaller or more precious than the rest, and thrusting it into her pocket
or up her sleeve. A large Indian screen was spread before the door,
which indeed MIchael, on hearing a voice that certainly was not that
of his friend Martha, to remain unseenlong enough to decide whether
his entrance would be likely to occasion her any embarrassment.

:I tell you, Martha, that you talk like a fool, and that is what you
always were, and always will be'' said the upright lady, in a shrill
voice, but in a tone that she was endeavouring to reduce to a whisper.
 WYht right can any one of these horrid dirty fellows have with what
is mine, I should like to know? I am not going to be male bankrupt,
or sent to jail, or have my property seized, because your abominable,
wicked, low-born, brutal, treacherous, false father, has been found
out, and is going to be treated as he deserves. As for you, and all
the rest of your family, there is nothing to be said or done, I suppose,
but to submit, and just do what you can to get your bread. With
such- blood as you have got in your veins, there will be no great harm
done if you were all to go out as housemaids and footmen. Thething
happens among low people continually, if the father gets into distress;
but I should like to know who ever heard of a woman of quality, the
daughter of an earl, being treated in the same sort of unceremonious
way ?'
 But indeed, Lady Clarissa, it will be a great deal worse for my
father, if it is found out that his wife has been endeavouring to secrete
property,'' said MArtha.
 His wife, indeed: A pretty sort of husband he has made me,
hasn't he? Having my noble arms painted on his paltry carriages;
and engraved on his plate, not a single ounce of which had been
twenty years in his possession; and then, vulgar wretch 1 insisting
upon seeing my housekeeper's account, for fear I should have any
thing out of the money he allowed met Pitiful, cheating, brutal,
manufacturing savage But thank Heaven my slavery is at an end
--To-morrow will see me many a good mile on my way to Scotland l
The monsters say I may take my,clothes and my money-and, my
clothes and my money.I will take, lI promise you, Miss Martha; so
I would really advise you to go and collect your own things, and see
them put together decently.  You may be able to sell some of them
perhaps, which might be very useful, and that would be spending
your time much more profitably, and decently too, than sitting there
lecturing me upon what I may, and what I cannot take. I shall take
very thing that belongs to me, and there's an end of that; and I
wish to my heart you would just go away and leaves in peace.''
Did I not know, Lady Clarissa, that my father would suffer for it,''
said Martha rising, `` I would not have troubled you with my ramon-
stances: but I am certain that you aren occupied in abstracting
things that of right belong to my poor father's creditors, and if it is
discovered, it may be the means of heir refusing his certificate, and
he may be thrown into a jail for life.''
And where could he be better,  Miss Martha? I am sure I don't
know. My belief is that he is mad, or going to,be made, and I don't
see but a jail is as comfortable as a mad-house, and as,it must
be a great deal cheaper, it will suit his circumstances a great deal
better. I wish you would go, child, and see if there is such a thing in
the house as a basin of soup for my luncheon. I may ring and ring,
but there is not a creature that will answer the bell now,''

failed him, and at times his temper has been so variable that I have
seen violently angry, and very temperature in his language, one
minute, and enduring the insolence of Lady Clarissa, with the meek-
ness of a child, context. And now-In short, Michael, I greatly fear
that his reason is shaken by the misfortunes that have fallen upon
him. He has kept all his commercial disasters so completely to him-
self, that not even his most confidential agents were at all aware of
their extent; and I therefore hope that if i can contrie to remove
him from this melancholy scene, his mind will be relieved by feeling
that the worst is over, and that I may have the exceeding happiness
of seeing him restored to reason and to health.''
'And in what was then can I be useful to you, my denr MIss
MArtha? I dare not combat your will, but it seems to me that if his
creditors are stripping his house in this way, such a sum as you have
put into my bands might be very useful to him,'' said michael.
And so it would, certainly, my good friend, if he had not pro-
video for the exigencies of this terrible moment, by having a large
sum of ready money in the house, a fact which he las confided to me
only,'' relief Martha.  His marriage with Lady Clarissa,'' she
continued,  has been a greater misfortune to him, Michael,
than any losses in his business could possibly be. She has led
him a most wretched life-constantly keeping his high spirit in subject-
tion by threatening to bring her brother upon him, if he treated her
with any want of respect, and my poor father's reverence for rank
and title is such, that he has submitted to her in every thing. ut
during the terrible fortnight that has passed since the disclosure of his
ruin, her conduct has been perfectly frightful-and I feel quite certain
that when she has taken herself off to Scotland, which she intends to
do to-grow, my father will feel so greatly relieved, that the very
best effect upon his mind may be hoped for from it. What i want
you to do for me, Michael, is this: You must procure a postchaise
to be at the Lodge-gates to-night at twelve, The men who are left
in charge of the house, get both tired and tipsy before that hour, and
will be in bed and asleep; and then I think I shall be able to get my
poor father away from all the irritating objects which surround him
here. e has been very ill with violent spasms, and confined to his.
bed for a day or two, which one of the maids tells me is the reason
why he has not been more strictly watched. They think he is too ill.
to get away. But he is greatly better to-day, and though I have per-
shaded him to remain in bed, I think he has quite lost the complaint,
and will be able to get off if you will do what I desire of you. I
know not another being that I could trust. My poor father has spent
a great deal of money, and been very liberal to many, but I do not
know one whom I do not suspect would be more ready to beta, than
to help him, if they saw him cndeavouring t get away. His physician,
Dr. Crockley, a man on whom he has heaped innumerable farouts, is,
I strongly suspect, acting as a spy upon him; and it is because lI ex-
peat his daily visit presently, that I will not let my father get up.
Therefore you see, Michael, there are some difficulties to be in-
348
THE LIFE AND ADVERSE
countered. Do you think you could manage to get a chaise to the
gates without its being known that it was for him ''
:I am quite sure of it,'' replied Michael ;  for to save timelY came
hither in a chaise myself, which is now waiting at the public-house to
take me back to Fairly. I heavenly to go and tell the boy that I shall
not be able to return before night, in order to have him ready to start
at any hour you please.''
T6 Fairly?'' caid Martha, musingly. `' But it is no matter-he
may sleep at the inn there as well as at any other, and the next morn-
ing we must make our way to the nearest port where there is a chance
of our finding a steam-boat going to France. Itwill not do at present
for my father to remain in the country. When he has got his certifi-
catch, he will be safe; but I greatly fear some difficulty about it.''
Will Martha was thus explaining her hopes and fears, the sound
of carriage-wheels was heard slowly approaching by the road which
led to the chief entrance, and which passed at no great distance from
the window at which they were sitting.
 Here comes Dr. Crocklcy '' she exclaimed: ``I am very glad his
visit willie over so early. This will give me time for preparation.''
bUt she was mistaken; the equipage she heard approaching was not
the recently sct-wp cab of Dr. Crockley, but the donkey-chair of the
ever active MIrs. Gabberly. Nothing could be much farther from
poor Martha's inclination than encountering the prying old woman at
this moment; but having hastily told Michael to appear as if he were
employed in taking a catalogue of the furniture, for which purpose,
ecr, end, and in lay conveniently ready on one of the marble-
slabs, she hurried out into the hall for the purpose of meeting
the physician, and attending him as usual to her father-so that the
avoiding Mrs. Gabberly was impossible.
Oh, my poor dear Martial that's you, is i(? Wall now: you
was just the person i wanted to see. But I do wonder you did not
get off with your father, poor man when he made his escape, this
morning,'' said the unchanged little lady.
1 know not what you mean, Mrs. Gabberly,'' replied Martha
gravely.  My poor father has been extremely ill, and is at this
moment confined to his bed,'' The old lady gave a link with one of
her little cunning black eyes, and nodding her head very expressively,
replied,  Old birds are not caught with chaff, my dear.''
 hat is it that you mean, Mrs. Gabberly-that you do not believe
me ?'' said Martha, indignantly.
 You are very foolish to bail out in that manner, my dear, with
that young fellow that's cataloguing in there, close within hearing.
Mind, it is your fault and not nine, if he suspects any thing from you
violence.,''
You are taking an account of all the looking-glasses, are to
not?'' said Martha, approaching the drawing-room door and address-
in Michael.  Yon may come into Sir Matthew's room now, if you
please. IIe was asleep when I sent you away just now.'' Then,
turning to Mirs. Gabberly, she added- Perhaps you would be so

3A9
good as to see my poor father, Mrs. Gabberly? I would not wish you
to stay tong with him, for he is very feverish; but I dare say he
would take it very kindly if you will just come in to inquire far him.''
Looking a good deal surprised, but accepting the invitation with
great alaerity, Mrs, Grabbers began to mount the stairs: exceedingly
well pleased to have an opportunity of procuring so excellent a ticket
of admission to every house in the neighbourhood, as this ocular
demonstration of the actual condition of the fallen knight would fur-
nish. MIchael, in compliance with the order he had received, followed
after; and in a few minutes, found himself once more in the presence
of the man under close tyranny he had suffered so terribly. Buta
harder heat than Michael's might have been softened into forgiveness
and forgetfulness of all former injuries, by the miserable aspect of the
wretched man who lay stretched upon the splendid bed that he
could no longer call hisowu. IIis steadfast-minded and affectionate
daughter-the only earthly good that avenging Heaven had left him-
center first, intending to announce the visit of Mrs. Gabberly; but
Sir Matthew started up in he, and before she could speak, cried out,
 Do not let that devil Crockley come to me, MArtial I will not see
if, I tell you. I have got no pain now; and if I had, don't I know
he would rather give me poison than physics? He is going to lose
his annuity, you know.''
Iis MIrs. Gabberly, dear papa, just come to ask you how you
are,'' said MArtha, leading the old lady to the bedside.  Sho will
to stay, because you are not well enough to talk; but you will be
glad to see her, will you not ''
Glad ?'' said the miserable man, knitting his brows, nand throwing
upon her a look of deep aversion. we Don't I know her? Is she not
the town-crier of all the country round? Have I not paid her for it a
hundred times? And do you think I don't know what she is come
for now ? Somebody else will pay her now, for bringing them word
how the poor bankrupt Dowling looks.''
Well now, that is terrible, to be sure t'' exclaimed Mrs. Gabberly.
e He is quite shook in his mind. Do you think he would be sutra-
genus if I was to feel his pulse, my dear? I should like to prescribe
for him-I should indeed. Poor dear man 1 His talking about paying
me is comical to be sure. Let me feel your pulse, Sir Matthew,
shall I2
Sir Matthew looked so very much as if he would have liked to take
her up in his enormous hand and throw her to the further end of the
room, that Martha thought it prudent to prevent her nearer ap-
roach.
You have now seen my father, Mrs. Gabberly,'' she said with
emphasis,  and that, 1 think, is all that can be necessary for your
satisfaction.''
OhIO certainly-it is very satisfactory,'' she replied, but without
appearing to have the slightest intention of leaving the room: for,in
truth, it was at that moment the place where, beyond all others, the
best liked to he. The downfall of Sir Matthew Dowling was the
3s0
TO LIE AND ADVENTURE
subject that employed every tongue, and nobody could be so welcome
to every drawing-room, and every dining-room too, throughout the
neighbourhood, as one who could testify to having seen him, listened
to him, and ascertained how he seemed to bear it. It was impose-
bible that any person could have been better qualified for the service
than Mrs. Gabberly. Willingly would the still brisk little lady havre
crept under the toilet-table, or the bed itself, rather than have lost so
glorious an opportunity; and instead of attending to Martha's repeated
assurance that she ``had better go now,'' she began opening sundry
physics-vials that stood on a table at the bottom of the bed, smelling
some, tasting others, and pronouncing judgment upon all.
It is quite a mystery to me, my dear, what Dr. Crockley can be
thinking of, giving such medicines as these to your father,'' said she.
I see, plainly enough, that he is in a very inflammable and irritable
state, and he ought to be put altogether upon the depleting plan.''
Then putting her finger on her lip, in sign of secrecy, she whispered,
OIl just stay here, Martha, behind the bed-curtains, till Dr. Cromwell
comes, and I think it may be very useful for us to have a little con-
versions together. I know my poor dear father's method in these
cases as well as he did himself, and he was regular bred you to,
which is more than we can say of poor dear Dr. Crockley.'
Exceedingly provoked, Martha now addressed her father, saying,
Mrs. Gahberly wishes to stay, papa, till Dr. CGrockley comes, in
order that they may have a consultation about you; but you won't
like that, shall you''
 Like it ?'' replied the prostrate man, with bitterness,  Oh1 dear
yes, I shall like it vastly1 They are exactly a fitting pair to come to-
gather, lowering and gloating round the bed of a ruined neighbour.
et her stay, by all means, Martha, let her stay and watch it all. See,
MIrs. Gabberly, there is a long auctioneering gentleman come to
take an account of the furniture. Isn't it pleasant? I am sure it
must do your heart good to see it, Don't go away, yong manI'' he
continued, addressing Michael, who, shocked and disgusted, was
making his way towards the door.  Don't go away. Go on, never
mind losing a little time, I dare say you will be paid for it all the
e., and my dear good neighbour would not enjoy it half so much
if she did not see something of the kind going on.''
' Oh, dear: oh, dear quite wild and wandering? Isn't he?-
Calling Brockley and me a pair toot As if we ever thought of such
a thing1 I am sure, for one, I can answer for it that I never did.-
His doll of a wife, you know, hasn't been dead above a year, and I've
no notion of such quick work, it is quite indecent, I think. Good
gracious me, now I'' she continued, catching Sir Matthew's fierce eye
fixed upon her with a mixture of hatred and bitter irony; '` what have
I said :-all but a guinea he fancies I mean something about his mar-
dying himself up, all in such a hurry with LAdy Clarissa.''
`` Lady Clarissa'' cried the knight in a loud voice. That's right
 had very nearly forgotten her ladlyship. Go to her this moment,
Martha-tell her to come here. Is she not my wife-bone of my

361
bone-flesh of my flesh? Is she not, Mrs. Gabberly ? And shall
she not come hither and share with me the delight of seeing a broker
taking possession of my furniture, and a dear good soul like you look-
in on? Go, Martha, go when I tell you, and bring the right to-
notable Lady Clarissa Dowling here.''
`I am quite certain she won't come, papa,'' said MArtha, leaning
down, and whispering in his ear. :` So don't make me go to her,''
 But she shall, though?'' shouted Sir Matthew, '' even if Go
down, and fetch her myself. My dear Mars. Gabherly, my sweet Mrs.
Gabberly-will you have the great condescension to go for her? You
used to run about, if I did but hold up my finger, you know-and
on would not be so ungenerous as to refuse now, merely because i
am a bankrupt: Go to my Lady Clarissa, if you please, sweet Mrs,
Aberly, and tell her that as she is a daughter of the noble house of
Highlandloeh, I wish, before we part, to give her a parting token of
remembrance. She knows that I wear a magnificent diamond ring,
Mrs. Gabriel, and you may just hint to her, if you please, that
nothing has been taken off my body yet. I do assure you it will be a
very pretty touching scene for you to witness, and talk about. It will
indeed. I am quite determined to have a sentimental parting and
as she has told me that she means to set off to-morrow, this will be
just the right time for it-won't it, MIrs. Gahberly 2''
Perfectly well disposed to execute the commission, and quite as de-
sirius as Sir Matthew could be that the proud poor lady who had
ever treated her with haughty coldness, should be properly humbled,
she darted towards the door, in order to perform her errand; but
MArtha, remembering the manner in which she had left her step-
mother engaged, stepped Forward to prevent her, quietly saying,  If
my father wishes to see his wife, Mrs. Gabberly, I can go for her,
without troubling you-and I really wish you would permit me to lead
you down stairs to your donkey-chair, at the same time-I am sure
you must be aware that papa is not in a state to bear seeing company.''
Yon are quite right, my dear, quite right, indeed-ir Matthew is
looking sadly wild and feverish, and I should say that nobody what-
ever but the doctor and his own family ought to see him. Of course
I suppose it would not be very convenient to hire attendants now, for
these sort of people, I am sorry to say, always insist upon ready money,
which is a cruel thing under such circumstances. t so it is, and
therefore it follows that found any Clarissa must be the chief nurses.''
Certainly, ma'am, it will be his own family who will wish to at-
tend this. And therefore, if you please, I will take you down stairs,
and see you to your carriage,''
 Mie: my dear:'' cruel MIrs. Gabberly, in the thrillers possible tone.
 Surely you cannot mean to call such an old friend as I am, com-

by this time, mustn't he t'
I ilI have her right honourable Iadyship here before that fellow
stirs a step, Martha. Do you hear me That's more than half the
fun,'' cried Sir Matthew, bursting into a shout of laughter. `` dOesn't
she know our kind, clever, observing, neighbour, who is come here so
thoughtfully, just to look about her a little? Don't she know her,
almost as well as i do? And won't she enjoy thinking what a pleasant
description dear Mars. Gaberly will be able to give of my Lord High-
landlord's sweet daughter watching the broker, and seeing that he sets
every thing down fair?''
Thankful was Martha that the supposed broker was one who could
not in reality add to the horror of the scene. She turned to him as
she left the room, saying, `` You had better remain here, if you please,
till I return,'' upon which he modestly ensconced himself in a distant
corner of the room, and resting his paper upon a commode, continued,
as he stood, to scribble upon it.
quite certain that it would be impossible to get rid of MIrs. Gab-
berry till her father's summons to his proud wife had been obeyed, and
greatly more anxious to clear his room of this troublesome guest, than
to spare the feelings of her lalyship, Martha entered the little sitting-
room, determined to deliver the message concerning the diamond-ring,
if she could not prevail without it. She found Lady Clarissa in the
act of finishing the packing of her basket, by laying on the top of it
sundry light articles of female attire, very cleverly calculated to make
the whole pass under the general description of wearing-apparel, which
the courtesy of the law permits to be removed by all persons in the un-
fortunate situation of her lalyship.
 Now I hope you will cease your pertinent preaching, Miss
Martha,'' she said, as the pale and agitated young woman entered the
room. ` Unless every separate nightcap and frill are to be examined
one by one by these brutes, I conceive no objection can be made to
this package. Gather up the cotton-wool, and poke it somewhere out
of sight directly.'' Martha obediently set herself to collect the
scattered fragments of the suspicious-looking wool, but as she did so,
said, :: MY father wishes to see you, Lady Clarissa.''
Insolent wreteh1' exclaimed her ladyship, pausing in the act
of collecting various little articles for which she had not found room
in the basket, ``have on the audacity to bring me this as a mes-
sage 7'
t My father says, Lady Clarissa, that as you are going to leave
him to-morrow, he should wish to see you once more,'' replied Martha.
MOnster 1'' streamed Lady Clarissa stamping her foot upon the
floor, `` he, see me again3 he, dare to lift his bankrupt eyes upon the
noble woman he has so barely injured --Tell him, you bold messenger
who fear not to face the descendant of a dozen earls to convey to
her the words of a bankrupt cotton-spinner, tell him, that the only
atonement he can make, is r . Tell him this from me-and
may the ostentatious settlement his unprincipled pride made on me,
o MIOIIAEL ARMSTRONG.
3s3
excuse me in some degree in the eyes of my noble brother, for the
degradation I brought upon him by accepting it' These last words
were uttered with clasped hands, raised eyes, fervent accents, and all
other ordinary indications of uttering a prayer
Indignant and disgusted, Martha felt no scruple in employing the
means her father had given her for obtaining the interview he desired,
and quietly said in reply to this burst, `` MIy father stated that his mo-
tive for asking to see you, Lady Clarissa, proceeded from his wish to
present to you, as a parting gift, the diamond ring which he wears on
lis right hand.''
The effect of these words was as sudden as that produced by the
magic touch of a hand employed in turning off gas.
 That indeed is a most natural wish1 Unhappy, guilty man I can
well believe that had he the crown jewels at command, he would
ccm them all too poor an offering to atone for the offence he has com-
pitted against mei 1 that God, MArtha Dowling, that my noble
blood has never taught me to forget that 1 as a Christian There
are many women, believe me there are, of less caltech rank than my-
self, who would not deign to obey such a summons. But I feel what
my duties are, and I shall nerve my courage to perform them. Como
with me to my dressing-room, Martha, carry that basket for me, and
then I will go with you to the bedside of' Sir Matthew.''
Martha attempted to obey, but the basket was too heavy for her to
carry, and she set it down again, declaring that the task was beyond
her strength.
 A tolerably good joke that,'' said Lady Clarissa,. endeavouring to
Laugh, `` considering your origin; but this is the last day of such
pleasant jestings, and therefore I must bear it with good humour I
suppose'' Then applyiogher own much stronger hand, she lifted ler
treasury, and was stalking off with it; but stopped short erc she
reached the door, saying, ` No, I will stay here while you go and
fetch my faithful Mistress Saunderson. She enters into all my
feelings l thank God and is as strong as a Highland pony into the
bargain.'' Having obeliently performed this commission, and brought
back the faithful Scotch waiting-woman, who had adhered very stead-
vastly to her mistress through all the vicissitudes of her fortune,
Martha at length succeeded in marshalling the Lady Clarissa Dowling
into the bedroom of her husband.
No signet-ring ever made a deeper impression on wax, than the
diamond one of Sir Matthew had done on the memory of his noble
wife; and her first glance, as she entered the room, was directed to
the hand which lay on the bedclothes, that she might see if it had
been already removed; but no2 there it sparkled still, and with a
gentler aspect than she had been seen to wear since the tremendous
hour when the declension of Sir MAtthew, from the richest commoner
in the country into a bankrupt, had been announced to her, she
said,
%You wish to see me, Sir MAtthew-mARtha says you wish to see
me.''

 Yes my beloved'' replied the knight. 'I do wish to see you:
ngelic sweetness IIow can I do otherwise? Look at yourself in
the mirror, most beautiful Clarissa? Look in the mirror before that
broker there carries it off and tell me if you think it possible that any
man could bear to part with so much beauty, without having one final
gaze upon it? Aud see, my dear, here is your amiable neighbour
Mrs. Gabbert Is it not kind of her to leave all other visiting,
that she may come to nestle herself here, among the very brokers, in
the very centre of our misery? It is so heavenly-minded of her,
isn't it? I guessed indeed that one great reason for her making such
a tremendous sacrifice was the hope of edification from beholding the
christian spirit with which your ladyship bears your ladyship's over-
throw; and besides her own improvement from it, she wishes to have
it in her power to describe it to the whole neighbourhood. Very right
of her, isn't it, my dear? And that is the reason why I sent for yon.''
In general the nose of Lady Clarissa greatly outblushed her checks,
which had more of the joaquin than the rose in them; but now, from
the tip of her high forehead, to that of her long chin, she became
crimson; and but from the remarkable length of her throat, which
seemed to rear itself in defiance of such danger a fit of apoplexy
might have been expected.
: Beyonce you vulgar gossip-picker !''she cried, turning in control-
able rage upon the terrified little woman, `` and tell the contemptible
neighbourhood through which you are going to crawl in your donkey-
cart, like a snail in his shell, leaving your slime as you go, tell them
all, from me, that the best consolation under my remorse at having
forgotten my own dignity by condescending to hold a place among
them, arises from being released from the degradation of associating
with contemptible a being as yourself, and all who are capable of
listening to you'' And having uttered these words in a piercing voice,
she rushed to the door, threw it with great violence wide open, and so
left it, as she pace, with rapid but tragic strides, to the shelter of
her own boudoir, and the sympathy of Mistress Saunderson.
It was, perhaps, because the door was open, and that he knew the
sound would follow her, that Sir Matthew burst into the most violent
shout of laughter that ever made itself heard from mortal lungs: it
terrified Macthasmade Michael Armstrong shudder, and caused MIrs.
Gabberly herself wish she were any where else, notwithstanding
thevery valuable information this extraordinary scene would enable
her to communicate. Long did this frightful laugh continue, and
when strength seemed to fail, and the boisterous merriment could be
sustained no longer, a vehement and reiterated hissing followed,
which at length ended in such complete exhaustion that Sir Matthew
fell back pale, and apparently motionless, upon his pillow..
: Mrs. Gabberly,'' said Martha, `1 must beg you to leave us now.
You must perceive that my poor further ought to be alone. It is very
important-fearfully important, I am afraid-that he should be kept

list in calling me company. Good gracious1 To think of the terms
on which i have always been in this house before your poor papa's un-
fortunate marriage: I cannot and I will not leave you in such a
condition. It would be perfectly monstrous, and every body would
call me a brute for it. Till Dr. Crockley has been here, I really
neither can nor will go. I am .quite determined that I will hear what
he says about him.''
Let her stay,'' said Sir Matthew, in a hollow whisper, which
proved that he was neither asleep nor dead, though his closed eyes,
and ghastly countenance, might have been mistaken for one state or
the other.
Martha went to him, took his hind, wipe the' profuse perspiration
from his brow, and then placing herself in a chair beside him, con-
tinted to watch his altered countenance, alike unmindful as it seemed
of the presence of Mrs. Gabberly, or that of Michael either.
The lady, perfectly contented to be thus quietly established as a
looked-on, determined, for the present, neither to move nor speak, lest
she might lose the valued privilege thereby; but Michael became so
conscious of the awkwardness of his situation, and so fearful lest
Martha, from forgetting him, might get into a scrape likewise, that he
ventured to approach the foot of the bed on tiptoe, merely for the
purpose of recalling himself to her recollection, and then, on seeing
her start at the sight of him, he said in a whisper, ``I suppose I had
better go down stairs now, MIss MArtha ?2''
Martha in reply to this nodded affirmatisely, and in the same low
tone added, `` I shall have other business to speak to you about. Do
not go away till you have seen me,''
Michael's eyes were naturally turned to MArtha while this passed;
but when he withdrew them, and was about to make lris retreat, he
caught the large, wide open, wild-looking ees of Sir Matthew fixed
earnestly upon him. The young man involuntarily dropped his eye-
lids, for the game was a frightful one, and turned to leave the room.
 tay :'' roared a hoarse but loud and stunning voice from the
bel. `` Stay1 devil: demon 1 hell-bird: what do you come here for 2
Cowardly blackguard Do you think I do not know you? You
never dared to come till it was too late for me to hold you I have
heard of your purring round the place weeks ago. Beauty escaped me
then, base runaway1 What do you come spying here for? Did you
think I should not know ye? Did you think I should forget those
d-d hypocritical eyes, and that hateful curly hair, of the devil's own
colour? No, my petty 'prentice, I have not forgotten your crocodile
looks, and never shall. I suppose you thought you should bring me
to repentance by sending home word that you were dead. Was that
it, eh?
1Iam able now, Sir Matthew, to pay for leaving the mill before my
time, and I am quite ready to do it, if you please,'' replied Michael,
gently. But he spoke to one who heard him not. Sir MAtthew had
a neck as short and thick as that of his lady was long and thin. HIs
last interview with her had not been a salutaryone for a man in his

state of mind and body; and the subsequent discovery of Michael,
of whose visit to the factory he had heard from Parsons, and at whose
escape he expressed the most unbridled rage, accelerated symptoms
which had before threatened him, and sent such a rush of blood to
the brain as instantly produced apoplexy, and left him totally deprived
of sense and motion.
.Martha, whose eyes were fixed upon him, uttered a fearful shriek,
and threw herself on the body, believing that he was dead. But MIrs.
Gabberly knew better, She had practised too long as an amateur
nOT to know a fit of apoplexy when she saw it, and promptly ex-
claimed, `` Get any, Maria2 Get of of him, child 1 He is not dead,
I tell you, and, if we could but bleed him, he would open his eyes
again fast enough.''
WVIh the rapidity of lightning poor MIarth obeyed. She with-
drew herself from the bed, endeavoured to raise her father in her arms,
and, by the help of MIchael, succeeded. She then bared his arm,
bound her own waist-belt tightly round it, and with unshrinking cou-
rage had thrust a sharp pennies which she drew from her pocket
into a vein, before the skilful lady who had prescribed the measure
had half recovered her astonishment on perceiving that the poor girl
had conceived the project of putting it into immediate execution.
The old adage that `` where there is a will, there is a way,'' was
never better illustrated than by this act of the tender-hearted and
invalided Martha. She felt that her father's life hung on the prompt-
ness with which the operation was performed; she felt too, that if she
shrunk from it, there was no one else who would perform it, and
totally forgetful of herself and her own feelings conquered the re-
billions weakness that would have held her hand, and did what
two minutes before she would have believed it utterly impossible she
could have done. The result did honour to the skill of MIrs. Gab-
early. The lazy current flowed, though reluctantly. Sir Matthew
opened his large eyes, rolled them from side to side, heaved a deep
and heavy sigh, and presently attempted to speak, but this was
beyond his power,
i WHat more should be done?'' said the pale, and now trembling
MArtha, turning towards Mrs. Gabberly.
hy now, my dear, you must just let him alone for a little bit,''
replied the physician by hereditary right. ee Well now 1'' she added,
 WAsn't it a blessing that I was here? If I had not said, he would
have been as dead as mutton by this time.''

fSln was the state of affairs in the bedroom of Sir Matthew Dow-
ling, when Dr. Crockley entered it. Were all the words which Mrs.
Gabberly then uttered in explanation of what she had done, why
she had done it, and how her doings had answered, to be written
down here, my waning pages would hardly suffice to contain them.
Dr. Crockley nodded. winked, approved, and applauded s great
deal, joked a little, and finally felt the patients pulse, observing at
the same time that it was necessary at any rate to bring him round
sufficiently to get a little talk on business out of him, before he pop-
pel off for good and all.
Very right and power if you can manage it, doctor,'' graciously
observed MIrs. Gnahberly, ` But on may depend upon it, that-'' and
here she whispered something, that it was especially intended Martha
should be neither the better for the worse for. he doctor nodded
anl winked, anl nodded again; and then turning to the poor girl
who was not only the one who alone in that presence cared any thing
for the prostrate millocrat, but the one of all created beings who
would alone have felt his death to be a cause of mourning. Dr.
Crockley turned to her, and with very little of even the external
decency of sympathy said,  Do you think you can manage to get
some mustard, my dear, out of the clutches of the bailiffs2?-because
that is what we want here.''
Without answering, MArtha moved towards the door: and Michael,
not conceiving that the physician's words were but a brutal jest, and
fancying that Martha might really have to petition those who now held
authority in thehousehold for the article wanted, stepped after her, to
request that he might execute the commission in her place.
 You shall cone down with me, MIchael,'' she replied, `'` and I
doubt not you will be able to procure what we want without difficulty.
But alas : Michael, it will avail nothing--I am sue by their whisper-
in, that they both know it will avil nothing. Nevertheless it shall
be tried. But is it not dreadful that of all his numerous family there
should be only one to receive his dying breath? O God1'' she
added with clasped hands and streaming eyes,  if 5t be a judgment,
let it atone for all that has been wrong: For surely it is a heavy
one t'
On reaching the hall, the pitying Michael, who in the sufferings of
is fiend forgot all the cruelty of his enemy, insisted upon going
alone into the thronged and noisy offices, while she sat down to wait
for his return. He did his errand promptly, and was by her side again
3a8

in a minute or two; but he found that she had left the chair on which
he had placed her, and was now pacing up and down the hall in
violent agitation.
:I am overpowered, I am borne down by all this horror-this
deep and bitter grief:'' he exclaimed.  And there is not a single
human being near me, but your ill-used self, Michael, from whom I
am likely to find any real kindness The conduct of all with whom
I have had intercourse since my poor father's distressed came upon
him, has been such as to make me wish rather to shun, than seek
them at this awful moment, yet I want some one to tell me to I
ought to get. 1 know that fearful man Parsons, who is greatly in his
confidence, had business of importance to settle with him; for again
and again my father has said to me, since the execution has been in
the house, that let what would happen, he must find time to speak to
him. Ought I not then to send to him in this extremity ?'
e ould to Heaven I were fitter to advise yo, my dear Miss
Martha 1'' replied Michael, with equal respect and tenderness. Cer-
mainly if such were your father's words, it is very right to remember
them. Shall I go to the factory and summon MIr. Parsons hither 2'
Oh It is hateful to me,'' replied poor Martha, `` to call such a
being to his deathbed But it may be that the interests of others
are at stake, and when I recall my father's earnestness as he spoke of
the necessity of seeing him, I tremble at the idea of disobeying him.
Go then, Michael : hasten to the factory, and tell this man that his
master is very ill, but that if he recovers his senses and his speech, it
is probable he may wish to speak to him.''
Michael lost no time in obeying her; and on reaching the mills
found the superintendent, as usual, at his post. At the first glance
he did not recognise the messenger, for the appearance of the young
man was greatly changed by the style of equipment which, under
the advice of MIr. all, had been provided for him. No sooner did
Michael speak, however, that the man started, as if he had been
shot.
eir Matthew send you'' he exclaimed, "` what mountebank tricks
are you go at now, you young villain What1 did you think that
this fine trigger could amboozle me? Has it really bamboozled
him? Have you, faith and truth, contrived to pass yourself off upon
your dearly-belocd benefactor as a gentleman of fashion and fortune
who was come to make him a visit of condolence upon his misfortunes?
A capital fellow, ain't you? or, perhaps, my nice yong grandee, you
fancy his grinders are drawn, and that he can't, or won't, maybe, have
any thing to do, now that he has fallen into trouble, with putting
such an elegant yeung gentleman to inconvenience  Is that it? But
it is just possible that other people may be more at leisure. Who
knows ?''
Neer mind me now, Mr. Parsons,'' replied Michael, utterly in-
different, at that moment, to any thing, and every thing, that his old
enemy might attempt for the purpose of annoying him.  Never think
of me or my affairs, at such a time as this. ou hare given me no
or mICHAEL ARI9ONG.

opportunity to speak, or you would have understood that it was not
Sir Matthew who sent me here, but his daughter. Sir MAtthew was
too ill, when I left the house, to know any thing about it; but Miss
MArtha thinks that, if he recovers his speech and senses, he may wish
to speak to you,''
t Like enough'' replied the superintendent with a sneer.  Sir
Matthew's troubles have nowisc changed his nature. The young lady
is quite right: but I shouldn't have thought as he'd have told her any
ling shot it, either. Not but what she might approve the job, to,
if she has got any spirit in her. But she is but a poor, ruling sort of
a cretur, much as she was when she used to cosset you, my beautiful
master runaway apprentice. HOwever, never mind that now, as you
say, ny pretty master: there's a time for all things. You may just
step in here while I change my coat. It bean't the first time as you
have entered this pleasant building, Master Mike, is it2''
Michael was going to obey him: but, at the moment he was about
to pass the threshold, something in the eye of the superintendent made
him pause. He recollected full well the ready lock of that once hated
door; and it struck him, as by no means impossible, that his old ac-
acquaintance might turn it upon him, if he put it in his power to do so.
Fears for his own personal safety, he certainly had none, being quite
aware that he was no longer in danger of being kidnapped as herero-
for; but the idea of Martha being left, at this her utmost need, in
want of any little service he could afford, was quite enough to make
him cautious, and with something of an involuntary smile, he stepped
back, saying, ``There is no occasion for me to wait for you, Mr.
Parsons: I have delivered my message, and you may obey it or not,
as you please. At any rate, you cannot want me to show you the way
to bowling Lodge.'' And so saying, he turned round, and walked
out of the yard.
 Peaslilent young viper'' muttered the superintendent between his
closed teeth. s That I should live to see him strut off before me in
that fashion : But I1'Ll have a try it 1 can't plague him yet. Fool
that I was, when had him snug by myself on Bridget Floor, not to
give him one farewell thrashing with the horsewhip. Ii had put out
a joint or two, it would have been no great matter; and then I should
have been spared the d-d sight of him now, marching off-hang him
like a peacock before me As to changing my coat, that's fudge.
People don't trouble themselves to change their coats, when they are
gig to pay their compliments to an apoplectic bankrupt.''
Having fairly got beyond all the bolts and bars immediately within
the jurisdiction of MIr. Parsons, Michael blackened his pace, being
rather inclined to have the society of his former tyrant, than not.
 Si MAtthew appears to be in a very dangerous state, Mr. Parsons,''
said he, as soon as the sulky superintendent came up to him.
Perhaps your right honourable greatness has been studying medi-
cia, since I had the pleasure of taking that little drive with you into
Derbyshire?''
36o
THE LIFE AND ADVENTURES
I have studied many things since that time, Mr. Parsons,'' replied
Michael, laughing: '` and one is the nature and use of locks.''
The'tone in which this was answered was so brutal, that the young
man, rather from disgust than anger, walked on faster than his foe
could follow him; and reaching the house some minutes before him,
made his way again without ceremony-for it was no time for it-into
the apartment of Sir MAtthew. A considerable change had taken
place in the condition of the patient since he left it. The capitals
had so far succeeded as to restore animation and consciousness: Sin
Matthew, still surrounded by Martha, Mars. Aberly, and the doctor.
was gazing upon them with widely-opened eyes, which, though wild
and wandering in expression, were evidently not devoid of speculation.
MIchael had entered very gently, but not without being heard by the
sick man; for he turned his eyes full upon him as he approached.
The sight of him, however, no longer seemed to produce any motion:
for after looking quickly at him for a moment, Sir Matthew turned his
gaze upon Mrs. Gabberly, wha from being in the act of leaning over
him, brought herself particularly within his sight.
eYe Parsons come?'' said MArtha in a whisper.
Ile must be in the hall by this time,'' replied Michael: ` shall I
tell him to come up ''
 My dear father has not yet spoken,'' she said; `` but, perhaps, he
may understand me.-Parsons is here, papa,'' she added, taking her
father's hand, and leaning over him-` should you like to see him ?''
He is in London, my dear,'' replied the knight very distinctly.
 Thank God :' exclaimed Martha, tenderly kissing him- Thank
God1 His speech is not in the least affected I'
Rather wandering, though,'' said Dr. Crockley, winking his eye
at MIrs. Gaberly.
 I should say, helped him again, if you want to get any thing out of
im;'' observe Mrs. Gabberly, looking graciously at the doctor.
 Perhaps I may, in an hour or two,'' he replied, applying his finger
to the patient's pulse.
Sir Matthew fixed his eyes upon him, and laughed a horrid, rattling.
ghastly sort of laugh, that seemed to come from his throat.  You
haven't quite doe with me yet, have yon, Crockley '' sai he.
Done with you, my dear friend? God forbid:'' replied the phy-
sician, rather startled at the apparently healthy state of his patient's
intellect, and affectionately smoothing his pillows, and settling the
bedclothes about him.
 WOuld you like to see Parsons, dear papa:'' said Martha, gently,
and again bending over him,
 Oh, yes?'' he replied clearly; I'Ll see Parsons now, directly-I
should be very sorry not to see Parsons. I may lie, or i may die,
you know; but I must sce Parsons.
MArtha immediately left the room, intending to explain to the
superintendent, before she brought him into it, the state in which her
father lay, and the necessity of receiving any orders he might wish to

give, with as little disturbance to him as possible. On reaching the
hall, however, she saw him not, and was on the point of returning u
stairs to inquire of Michael where he had left him, when she caught
the sound of his voice from Sir MAtthew's study. On entering this
room she perceived not only MIr. Parsons but Lady Clarissa, who,
standing before the commode in which, as she happened to know, her
husband was accustomed to keep papers of importance, as well as
money, appeared to have been very assiduously examining its con-
tents; for every recess had evidently been visited, and, as one of her
hands was tightly clutched over a pocket-book, it seemed that her re-
searches had not been wholly in vain, and that she had not privately
obtained possession of his keys for nothing.
I was sent for, my lady,'' said Parsons, apparently replying to
some question of her ladyship's, which, to judge by her angry frown,
and the vexed expression of her countenance, had not been a civil
DC.
MIy father wishes to see Mr. Parsons directly,'' said Martha.
 And by your ladyship's leave I must take that green pocket-book
with me,'' said Parsons.
 What pocket-book, you rude fell ?' replied LAdy Clarissa, in-
slightly.
 That one as your ladyship now holds in your left hand,'' replied
the confidential superintendent.
I wonder, sirrah, that you do not ask me to give you the rings
off my fingers I'' cried the angry mistress of the mansion. Go to
your master, fellow, if he has sent for you, and I shall go too. So
you need not trouble yourself about the pocket-book.''
And with these words she pushed past both Martha and Mr. Par-
sons, preceding them to the sick mans chamber. By the time they
entered it his eyes were again closed, but he appeared to breathe
without difficulty, though rather more audibly than usual, and
Martha fancied that he was asleep.
 Hush:'' said she.  Do not disturb him. He is sleeping.''
Dr, Brockley and MIrs. Gabberly had withdrawn to a window, and
were evidently in consultation; hut whether on the symptoms of
apoplexy, or bankruptcy, might be doubtful. Michael, however, was
standing close beside the bed, and in answer to Martha's observation
shook his head, saying,  NoI nat asleep.''
Then he'll manage to her why Ve got to say to him,'' said
Parsons, advancing, and throwing a glance of spiteful vengeance at
Lady Clarissa, `` because it is just what he wants to know.''
At the sound of Parsons's voice Sir MAtthew opened his eyes, and
made an effort to raise himself, but this was beyond his power, and it
was only by being life with as little effort as possible on his own
part, as if he were already dead, that he was placed in the attitude he
seemed to desire, and in which he was supported by pillows, and by
the arms of poor Martha, who had placed herself on the bolster
behind him.
3ez
THE LIFE AND ADVENTURES
It was a frightful and awful expression which then took possession
of his sunken features, nevertheless a hateful sort of smile made part
of it.
. Parsons that's you, isn't ? That's Parsons that stands
there2'' he said, directing his misty eyes full upon the superinten-
dent.
Yes, Sir Matthew, 'tis me,'' replied the man.
Have you done my bidding, Parsons ?'' demanded the knight,
with a sort of gasping which seemed to threaten that his breath was
about to leave him.
Yes, Sir Matthew, it's all regularly male out,'' replied Parsons,
'nobody can mistake now about times or dates in any way,''
``And isn't that the Honourable Lady Clarissa?'' said the sick man,
directing his eyes towards her.
Yes, Sir Matthew,'' replied Parsons, with something like a twitter.
 Then-then-then,'' panted the dying man, `` let her ladyship
know what was the last business that I gave you instructions about,''
 A very fitting business for an honourable gentleman to attend to,
when his affairs are in confusion, and he not in an over good state of
health,'' replied the confidential servant, turning himself round, so as
exactly to face her ladyship.  No less n blatter than restoring three
good thousand pounds a year, for ever, towards clearing scores with
his creditors.'
Now three thousand pounds a year was exactly the sum, for the
settlement of which upon herself, a daughter of the noble house of
Highlandloch had condescended to assume the name of Dowling, and
the mention of the often-meditated sum roused her ladyship's attention
so effectually that her face involuntarily protruded itself beyond her
body, till her nose very nearly reached that of the individual who
was addressing her.
Go on 1' said Sir Matthew, positively chuckling, though his chin
:;,;::..eEe.
with Mrs. Gabberly had drawn near to listen to this very interesting
disclosure,-'` well then, justice is justice; and Sir Matthew, let him
die when he will, won't have it upon his conscience that he defrauded
his creditors to make a settlement upon any lady in the land, gentle
or simple; because you see he has left proof, plain and clear, that he
had committed more than one act of bankruptcy before he made the
settlement upon her ladyship, and for that good and excellent reason
her ladyship will have no right to one single penny that he leaves
behind him; and that is a comfort to an honest man like me, who
likes to see justice done to high and low,''
 VIllain I'' screamed Lady Clarissa, it is false''
 No, no, no, no l'' issued from the pillows, in a voice that shook
with ghastly laughter.  True, all true; and now shemay go to
Scotland.''
Just ask her to give you your green pocket-book, Sir Matthew,
or can ARMsTRONG.

before she goes,'' said Parsons, grinning. I saw her ladyship take
it out of your bureau, and if she will be pleased to open her and, I
think it will tumble out of it.
WIth a lOok of inexpressible rage, Lady Clarissa turned away from
him and made towards the door.
Stop her, Crockley'' cried Si:r Matthew, feebly, adding with
panting difficulty, `` and--you-shall-have-it.''
Dr. Crockley had a great respect for the peerage, and would, be-
bond all question, have preferred snatching a pocket-book from nine
hundred and ninety-nine untitled ladies in succession, rather than
from one Lady Clarissa; but he felt that this was no moment for were-
many, and obeying what was very likely to be the last behest of his
patron, he rolled his fat person after her with extraordinary muscular
exertion, and grasping the lady's robe with one hand, seized on her
rigidly clenched fist with the other, in such a sort, that, according to
the prophecy of MIr. Parsons, the green pocket-book dropped out
of it.
Unfortunately, however, the attitude in which this feat was per-
formed, was one which could not be retained by the ill-balanced
person of the doctor, after the supporting form of the lady on whom
he had thrown himself had escaped from his grasp, and, struggling
with as much anxious care as Car to fall well (i.e. upon the
pocket-book), he measured his length upon the ground.
Parsons, though certainly not hoping for so lucky an accident, had,
with the same sort of instinct which brings the crow beside a sickly
sheep, followed closely the retreating steps of her ladyship, and ad-
mostly jerking the coveted pocket-hook with his foot, so that it should
escape the being buried under the stumbling physician, prepared him-
self to dip and catch it. But the success of the maneuver was lese
perfect than its ingenuity deserved; for are his tall rigid person had
bent itself sufficiently for him to reach the ground, MIrs. Gabberly,
who had become one of the group the same instant with Dr. Crock-
ley, was in possession of it, and are the prostrate Crockley or the
stopping Parsons could raise their eyes, the prize had dropped into
the deepest recesses of a prodigious pocket, which reached nearly to
the bottom of her little petticoat.
It is probable that both inquiry and search might have been insti-
tuned in consequence of this, had not the condition of the patient at
that moment rendered it impossible. Sir Matthew's ghastly eyes had
fixed themselves on LAdy Clarissa during the foregoing scene, but as
if, though they had still the power of discerning objects, they had lost
 that of moving after them, he appeared to lose sight of her as she
approached the door, and the heavy orbs seemed seeking for some-
thing on which to rest themselves without any change of position. It
chanccd that Michael, who, quite aware that the last moments of Dir
MAtthew were approaching, determined not to leave the premises till
he had learned the wishes and intentions of Martha, was at that mo-
ment moving from the corner he had occupied near a window, not
within sight of the bed, to a table exactly at the foot of it, on which
36A
THE LIFE AND ADVENTURES
was placed a facmn of Cologne water, which poor March, almost ex-
haunted by the painful attitude necessary to sustain the pillows, had
made him a sign to get for her. This movement brought him within
the range of Sir Matthew's eyes, and something in his aspect as he
cautiously bent to take the bottle, or else the thick-coming fancies of
a brain diseased, though not paralyzed, suddenly produced a terrible
effect upon the dying man, and he uttered a cry harsh and terrible
as to constrain the attention men of the preoccupied group at the
door.
t There's a dead ody walking about the room'' he ejaeulated in
an unnatural and frightful accent. : He is come for me and I must
go?'' The shriek which followed these words was terrible. In a
minute or two he spoke again, but almost in a whisper. ` One
No 1--it is not one, it is five hundred. Take them-take them
away from me, I tell you: They are all dirty, beastly factory-children,
Their arms and legs are all broken and smashed, and hanging by bits
of skin. Take them away, I tell you, Crowley: Their horrid joints
will drop upon mel They are dangling and loose, I tell you'' and
then again he shouted with so fearful a or, that even Parsons pressed
his hands upon his ears to save them t(rom the sound.
 Calm him1 calm him 1'' cried the trembling Nathan.  Can you
not give him something that may still this dreadful agony, Doctor
Crockley ?'
` It is not a very easy symptom to master, Miss Martha,'' replied
the physician daily.  However, it is not likely that it will last long.
All the life that's leftist just about the heart and brain, which is always
unlucky if there happens to be any thing particular upon the mind.''
: Parsons'' cried the dying man, again raising his voice, but with-
out looking towards the person he addressed.  Parsons are you
not ashamed of yourself to turn the whole set of them out on me
at once in this way? On that have paid, and bribed, and tipped so
often1 Rascal1 Take them off me, I tell you1 Do you mean that
they shall stile me? They will stifle me:-they will, they will. I
cannot breathe for them1 Parsons l-I tell you they will stifle me .''
Papal dear, der papa 1'' cried Martha, bending forward till her
cheek touche that of her father.  Compose yourself: It is only
that you are wiNkwell and fancy things. There are no children here,
papa, but your on Martha.''
. Her tendercaresses, and her gentle voice together, seemed to reach,
and quiet for a moment his wandering intellect. He made an effort to
turn his head towards her, but that was impossible; and Michael, who
had, upon his first frightful cry, removed himself to the head of the
bed, where the eye of the wretched man could not reach, silently
offered to take MArtha's place, that she might station herself where it
could. . She quickly understood him, and in a moment stood where
that dying eye could gaze upon her. Isis hand, with its glittering
ring, still lay upon the bed; she took it in her, and fondly chafed and

But it was too late; his lips never opened more. For some hours
longer he continued to breathe. but, on again feeling bis pulse, Dr.
Crocklcey declared that is faint pulsations must inevitably cease
before night.
I suppose your old servant Betty Parker is still in the house.
Miss Martha?'' sid he. The poor girl bowled an affirmative, but had
to power to speak.
Wall, then,'' said the doctor,`' I should recommend that you
should put her to sit here; it is no god for any of us to stay any
longer, for it's all over just as much as if he was already in his coffin.
You had better go away, and see what you can pack up to get of
with, Miss Martha, that's all that is left to be done, as far as 1 can
see. Come, Mirs. Gabberly,'' he added, I have got a friendly word
or two to say to you, so your boy shall mount my pony and I'Ll drive
your monkey for you.'' And so saying, he took the little woman
nder his arm and trudged off, without waiting for her to inform him
whether she approved his proposal, or not. Mlr. Parsons, giving one
scowling look at the silent bed, followed them, and MArtha and
Michael were left together beside the dying an.
Upon perceiving the totally unconscious state into which Sir Matthew
had fallen, Michel had gentle withdrawn himself from behind his
pillows, and now stood, almost as silent and motionless as himself,
beside the bel, respectfully waiting to receive from the desolate and
keeping martha some hint or instruction respecting his staying where
he was, or leaving her. Never, when the poor dependant of her
family, a le young heart of Michael been impressed with a feeling
of respect so profound as he at that moment felt for the unhappy girl.
in truth the feeling was so powerful as to interfere with his usefulness,
for he shrank from appearing to put himself forward too presumptuously
by giving her advice, or venturing in any degree to dictate what it
might be best for her to do. But when, after remaining thus bash-
fully silent for a quarter of an hour, he perceived that she gave no
other sign of life than by tears that flowed incessantly, and signs that
seemed to have her breast `` almost to bursting,''-when he saw this,
he began to think that some degree of seeming presumption on his
part might he better and more profitable for her, whom he would
really he died to serve, than the continuance of a degree of defer-
ence, which must render him useless. Approaching, therefore, to the
chair on which she had thrown herself, he ventured to say, `` Miss
Martha where can t find your old servant getty Parker? I remember
her very well-she used to be always in the nursery. If you would
tell me where she is likely to he, I will go for her.''
Poor Martha for a moment ceased to keep, and looked up at him.
 Michael Armstrong'' she replied, i am not conscious of ever
having injured any human being but yourself; and yet you are the
only one who is near to support and help me at this dreadful hour.
God bless you for your kindness, my god boy: o t go away,
MIchael-that is, I mean, do not leave the house will all is over-in-
deal, I think you may be useful to me'
366
THE FIRE AND OVErTURES
 Mies Martha,'' he returned, ` will you trust me to sit here, while
you yourself summon whomever you may wish to keep you company-
I will keep out of sight in case-'' and here he stopped.
His eyes will never open more, Michael:'' she replied, while the
tears again burst forth, '` and thank God their last look at me was
gentle bUt I almost fear to leave the room, Michael-I would not
that he should breathe his last and I not by him,'' But Michael,
skillful as he was, felt that the scene was too awful a one for the
poor girl to be left alone in, and he therefore persisted to declare with
the authority which sch subduing sorrow gives to all around who
will take the trouble to exercise it, that he would watch by the bed-
side of her father while she sought the old woman mentioned by
Dr. Crockley.
Reluctantly, and unresistingly she consented, and giving a look at
the bed that seemed to bring her very heart, she pitted the room,
leaving Michael armstrong alone with the motionless mass of still
living clay, before which he had so often trembled.
How strangely eventful had been the interval between those well-
remembered days, and the one actually present with him How
extraordinary the change in the circumstances of both parties: It
was not triumph, but it was thankfulness, which Michael felt, as the
sense of this came fully upon him during these moments of profound
stillness; and the result of all the moving thoughts that crowded
upon his mind was an earnest prayer to Heaven that he might never
be placed in any circumstances likely to harden his heart. and make
him the cause of suffering to others,-a fearful and a dreadful crime,
which he felt, as he gazed with trembling be on the sunken features
of the living core before him, must in the sight of God be held
as one of the most daring rebellion to his heavenly will of which man
is capable.
Solemn and solitary as was Michael's position in the chamber of
Sir Matthew, the interval of Martha's absence did not seem long.
She returned accompanied by the old servant who had been nursery
attendant, though never raised to the dignity of nurse, from the birth
of the eldest child of the family, and who was the only one remaining
of all the numerous household who retained the slightest feeling of
attachment to any of them. To her, habit stood in the place of
preference, and she might perhaps be said to love all the Dowling
children, from the eldest to the youngest; a sentiment which led her
to conceive, as in duty bound, a most hearty destination of their step-
mother. It was, therefore, with something very like pleasure that she
obeyed a summons so solemn and soperemptory as to justify her, even
in the judgment of Mrs, Saunderson, for laying aside the ironing-box,
which she had been plying incessantly for two whole days upon the
frills and furbelows of Lady Clarissa, in order to obey it. On per-
ceiling the condition in which her master lay, Betty Parker strongly
advised poor Martha to retire, urging the uselessness of her remaining
to look upon what was so grievous, when a baby might see at half a
dance that the poor gentleman could not tell friend from foe. But

368
T LIE AND ADDRESS8
Michael watched the overloaded vehicle roll by with great satisfy-
tion.  Whatever happens,'' thought he,  Miss Martha must be
better without her,'' Relieved by knowing that he should not again
run the risk of encountering her delectable ladyship, Michael immedi-
lately took his way to the magnificent mansion she had forsaken, and]
perceiving that the hall-doors stool wide open, preferred passing
through them to encountering again the motley throne that had taken
possession of the offices. But instead of finding this portion of the
house as quiet and foraken she had left it, he was started by hear-
in, as he mounted the steps of the stately portico, a multitude of
voices in violent altercation.
At first he felt disposed to turn away and seek another entrance,
but the vehemence of the sounds he heard excited his curiosity, and he
went on. Instead of one, half-a-dozen strangers might have entered
without running any risk of having their right there challenged; so ll
great was the confusion that reigned; and MIchael might have passed
up the great stairs, and into the chamber which it was his purpose to
visit, without any difficulty. But he was prevented from taking im-
mediate advantage of this, by hearing words which excited new fears
for the unfortunate MArtha; and, here he had listened many minutes, he
became aware that a new creditor had reached the lodge after he left
it, who had come, armed with proper authority, to arrest the knight,
dead or alive. Nor did the discussion of this event case all the up-
roar; for the agents of the parties who had previously sent in the ex-
ecution were threatening with all sorts of punishment, several of the
servants, whom they accused of having been bribed to assist Lady
Clarissa in the removal of many valuables which she had no right to
take. It was not this part of the tumult, however, that interested him
and, having obtained but too clearly the information that Sir Matthew,
was arrested, he once more sought for the unhappy Martha in the]
dismal chamber where he had left her. And there he found her; but]
with such frightful adjuncts to her natural grief, that the state of quiet]
,ee;e  eerie wvues
ensiable compared to that in which he found her now.
Sir Matthew had breathed his last, and the corpse was already ar-]
ranged with decency upon its stately bed; but, on each side of it stood
an officer, whose duty it was to violate by their presence the solemn
sanctity of that dismal chamber, and to prevent the body's being
carried to the grave, till the claims of their employer were satisfied.
In front. of her father's corpse, with her troubled eyes (no longer
bathed in the healing dew of natural sorrow), turning from it to its
rude guardians, and back again to all that was left of the sinful being
she had so fondly, blindly loved,-stood the wretched daughter, so
sad a spectacle of woce, that it was evident the men themselves turned
their hard eyes studiously away, because they feltas pang of pity as
they looked upon her.
Come with me, Miss Martha'' tried Michael, unceremoniously
seizing her arm. " Yon must not, you cannot remain here. on
can do no good, Miss MArtha; all is over now1 You must come
oF MIICIIAEL STRONG-
36o
away, yo just indeed,'' The only answer that poor Martha gave,
was forcibly shaking off the hand that held her, and then pointing,
first to her father's body, and afterwards to the two unseemly attend-
ants who stood beside it.
`tIt is no use, young man, to strive with her,'' said Betty, who was
still occupied in completing some of her lugubrious operations about
the bed:  I know her better than you do. She will stay here
watching him till she is as dead as he is, rather than go away, and
leave his body to be tended by such as those.'
For a moment Michael really felt all the generation effects of de-
pair, and stool perfectly incapable of even imagining any means of
help for the agony which it wring his heart to witness. But, as the
old woman pursued her ghastly occupation, she went muttering on,
explaining on the sinful and christian outrage that was thus com-
fitted.  And what will the rogue get by it'' she said. : Does a
mean to shows the corpse for a farthing a head to his factory black-
guards? Isn't he as big a fool as he is knee2
No, mistress, no, by no means,'' said the friendly defender of
Mr. Joseph Parsons:-for it was at his suit that the body of Sir
MAtthew had been arrested.--`` You may call the superintendent
9gue, or knave, or what you will of that kind, and I don't suppose
]that there's many as would contradict yo: but, as to his being a fool,
specially as to the doing what he has done here, that he is not.
['Was his only chance.''
]And how much do you think he'll make of it?'' demanded old
]Beauty with a sneer.
] Why, just the four hundred and sixty-seven pounds as is due to
]him,'' replied the man.
]To all this poor Martha appeared not to pay the slightest attention,
]and, in truth, neither understood nor heard a word of it; but Michael
did, and with sudden animation stepped up to the man who had
spoken, and whispered in his ear, :: Perhaps we may be able to settle
this business without any further difficulty. Step out of the room
with me, will you, for a moment: your companion can do all that is
]necessary without you.''-- Neither I nor my employer are people to
:::::::.
They accordingly retired together: and in a wondrous short space of
time the uninitiated MIchael was made to understand all the circus-
stances of the case, the most important of which was that if, as Mr.
Parsons hoped and expected, Miss Martha could find ready money
]enough quietly to pay his little private account with the late Sir
Matthew, the arrest would be immediately withdrawn, and the body
]left for her to dispose of it at her pleasure.
]``And the sum,'' said Michael, `` is-how much''
]For hundred and sixty-seven pounds,'' replied the man, `` with
some little matter, not exceeding four or five pounds more, for costs.''
]WIthdrew the arrest,'' said Michael, `and the money shall be
instantly forthcoming.''
2 n

THE LIPE ND ADYETtRES
 Let us see the money forthcoming,'' replied the fellow, grinning,
`` and the arrest shall be instantly withdrawn,''
 Here is the money, sir,'' said Michael, taking out the pocket-book
containing MArtha's generous donation, and drawing from it notes to
the amount demanded.
 Then the business will be soon settled, young gentleman. May
I take the liberty to ask your name?''
` My name is of no consequence whatever, sir,'' replied Michael.
"But lose no time in giving me the discharge. Only first enter that
chamber with me once again, withdraw your companion from his
frightful watch, and tell the poor yeung lady that it is over.''
The man really obeyed, and the mourning, but thankful Martha
was once more left with her old servant, to watch beside her father's
core.

TiE circumstances which immediately followed are not of sufficient
consequence to detain us long. Our old acquaintance, MIr, Augustus,
now Major Dowling of the- regiment, quartered at the distance of
a day's journey, was sent for to get through the melancholy business
going on in his paternal mansion, as well as he could; to give orders
respecting the funeral, and to make himself as thoroughly acquainted
with the real state of his family affairs as circumstances would permit.
Michael, meanwhile, had taken leave of the weeping MArtha without
having given her the slightest hint as to the means by which Sir
Matthew's body had been released. Had he not known that the MIr.
Augustus, whose kicks and pinches he so well remembered, was ex-
pelted to arrive for the protection of his sister, and of whatever pro-
party they might still call their own, he would hardly have made up
his mind to leave her, however conscious he might have been of the
doubtful propriety of offering such protection as he could give. But it
was evident that the poor girl thought he had better go, though it was
equally so that she parted from him with the greatest reluctance.
 You shall car from me,'' she said, '` my good Michael, and if
it should never be my good fortune to see to more, remember me
with the same forgiving kindness that you have shown through all the
dreadful scenes you have witnessed here. You have a good and ge-
nervous heart, Michael, and though I know you suffered much by being

371
present at them, you will always like to remember how greatly your
presence helped to support your carly friend in her great affliction''
lb3but it was not destined that these sad scenes should be the last in
which Michael and his early friend were to be thrown together. In
little more than a week after the death of Sir Matthew, and while
Michael was still anxiously waiting at Fairly for such ridings from her
as might put him at liberty to set off without further delay for Nice,
 packet reached him from Dowling Lodge, containing two letters
One was from Martha, and contained these words:
Dear Michael,
MY brother tells me that all of us, who are old enough, must
seek our own living, for that there is nothing left to support us. MY-
self especially, he says, must, to use his own words, look about me
directly, as my behaviour to my family has never been such as to jus
tiny my looking to any of them for assistance. This amounts to my
being actually turned out of doors, an exigency which at this moment
leaves me no other resource than what is afforded by the enclosed let-
ter. Read it, Michael, and let me know if you are willing to give
me your assistance and protection in reaching the amiable writer of it.
I could never have accepted, even for a day, the hospitality she so ge-
nerously offers, could I not prove to her, by bringing you with me, that
the sad subject which interrupted our friendship some seven or eight
years ago, could never again be a source of pain to either of us.
My dear father's last act towards me, which was, as I think I told
you, the placing a few hundred pounds in my hands for the express
purpose of my leaving the country, will enable me to undertake this
long journey without being a burden upon you, The green pocket-
oil, Michael, so well known to MIr. Parsons and Lady Clarissa, as
the repository of my fathers ready money, and sodisgracefully struggled
for during islands moments, will prove of no value to its possessors be-
bond its morocco cover and its silken lining; for the notes which he
took from it to give to me, were the last he ever placed in it. My
messenger has orders to wait for your reply. If it will suit you im-
mediately to accompany me to Nice-my first stage shall be to the
little in at Fairly, which you mentioned to me. I fear you will find
me a weak and troublesome traveller; but I think I have been in-
proving in health ever since I learnt that I had not your death to
answer for,
 Your grateful friend,
 Manu DoriC,''
The other letter was from Miss Brotherton, and ran the:
 Need I tell you, my dearest Martha, with what feelings I received
the news of your present painful position? Your father's marriage with
Lady Clarissa was, for your sake, a source of great sorrow to me, for
l was certain that your domestic happiness would be destroyed by it;
and this most unexpected event of your father's bankruptcy makes

THE LIFE AND ADVENTURES
me feel quite sure that you have no longer a comfortable home in
England. Come then to me, my dear MArtha1 The painful estrange-
ment which grew between s, just when I was beginning to know and
value your excellent qualities, has long been a source of very painful
regret to me, because I am aware that I judged you unfairly, and
pronounced that judgment harshly. Be generous, the, and prove
that you can forgive this, by immediately giving me the pleasure of re-
ceiling you as my guest. When we are together, we will consult about
what will be best for the future; but at any rate I have the artifact-
tion of knowing that the climate to which I am inviting you is likely
to be beneficial to your health during the approaching winter: come
to me, then, ear friend, without delay. On the other side you will
find the route sketched that lI recommend you for your journey. My
quarters are room enough to accommodate either man or maid-
servant, or both, if it will suit you to be so accompanied.
Eer, my dear Martha,
'` Affectionately yours,
 ManY BnoruERTo.''
The consequence of this packet was another metamorphosis on the
part of MIchael, ` She shall not think,'' said he, addressing MIr. Bell,
that my respect for her is lessened because her fortune has fallen.
I will wait upon her with faithful duty and most grateful affection:
but she was born in a place, and I in a cabin; and I will not, espn-
cially just now, trudeau myself upon her as a companion. As her
servant I hope i may be useful to her, and it is in that capacity that I
shall attend her,''
There was so much good feeling shown in this project, that Mr. Bell
could not oppose it, whatever he might think of its necessity; and
MIchael, therefore, gave the astonished Martha the meeting at the
little in she had named, in the character of a very neat and respect-
able-looking man-servant. Her faithful Betty Parker, who had con-
rented to be the companion of her journey, was in the room with her
when Michael made his appearance at the door, to receive her orders.
he cautious manner in which he made her comprehend his purpose,
and the nature of the office he had assumed, suggested to her the
propriety of not discussing it in the presence of the well-contented
Betty, who was exceedingly comforted by discovering that the young
man whom her mistress had informed her would travel with them, was
to do so as her fellow-servant, as she by no means felt herself capable
of becoming `` servant of all work'' to a young lady travelling through
foreign countries, of which she had never even heard the names. But
having contrived to dismiss her female attendant on an errand, Martha
began to remonstrate with her faithful squire upon the great mistake
he had made in fancyig that she had ever thought of travelling with
him in any other capacity than that of a friend. All she said, how-
ever, was in vain. Michael, though in a manner the most humbly
respectful, persisted in his purpose: and the almost destitute girl was
therefore constrained to set off upon her travels in a style which she
o MIIGIIAEL ARMSTRONG.
a73
felt to be very unfitting to her situation. Her conscience, however,
could not reproach her for this, for most assuredly she could not help it.
any were the letters, and various the mementos of affection,
entrusted by MIr. and Mrs. Fell to the care of Michael for their
dearly-beloved MAry Drotherton. Nor was there an individual of
whose welfare he thought it would please her to hear, whom he did
not visit to receive their loving blessings for the benefactors who, not-
withstanding hcr wide wanderings, hal never failed to remember the
wants of all who had faithfully served hcr, or in any way become
dependent on her bounty.
These duties completed, and a farewell of most grateful affection ut-
tered to the amiable clergyman and his excellent wife, Michael set off
on his long journey with feelings of hope, joy, confidence, fear, diff-
dencc, and trembling affection,-all so strongly mixed together in his
bosom that, had his life depended on it, he could not himself have told
which i was that most frequently preponderated. Yet, altogether, his
state of mind was very delightful: the novelty and excitement of jour-
keying, so pregnant of enjoyment to most of us, was most especially
captivating to him, whose education had been little more than the
checked development of imagination, and of that keen observation
of all surrounding objects which his shepherd life had taught him.
The first painful interruption to the state of felicity, arose from his
finding himself under the necessity of confessing to Martha that he
had no more money wherewith to pay their way. Aware that in the
performance of his self-appointed office Michael would have to pay
every thing, and keep a regular account of it; and aware also that
the money he had received from her would enable him todo this,
without giving him the additional trouble of daily settlements with
her, she had merely said, a minute or two before they set of,  You
will be kind enough to be my banker, Michael, during the journey,
and we will settle accounts at the end of it,''
For just one week from the day of their leaving Fairly, he was
able to do this; but then the little remnant of his treasure failed him,
and great as was his repugnant to the measure, he was compelled by
dire necessity to confess that nearly the whole of her generous gift
adl gone to- ``to satisfy the capacity of Mr. Parsons.''
It would be hardly possible for one human being to be more grate-
fnl to another than poor Martha felt to her young attendant after this
disclosure. She rcmembhcred the agony which he had made to cease:
she remembered, too, her state of utter incapacity even to compare-
end, and still less to avert the horrors that surrounded her; and,
spite of all Michael's respectful efforts to induce her to perot er
allotted character properly, she never from the hour of this disclosure
treated him otherwise than as a year and valued friend.
As their journey approached its termination, however (to which
period Michael had looked with peculiar anxiety, as that most im-
portant to the dignity of Martha), there was one argument, and on
only, by which he was able to coax liver into letting him make his first
appearance before Miss IBrotherton in the character of her servant;

TRE IFE AND ADvENTURES
distracted eyes fixed themselves on the agitated face before him as if
they would read in it the history of years.
 Edward -Teddy?'' cried Michael, opening his arms, and making
a step in advance.
In the next instant the brothers were locked in each other's arms,
and Miss Brotherton drew back, and gazed upon them from a distance
as if the very ground that sustained hearts under the influence of
such feelings was holy-while Fanny Fletcher, rose and sat down,
and rose again, checking the feeling that would have sent her t
stretch forth a hand of welcome to her old friend, by telling herself
that no hand, no voice but Edward's could be cared for then. And
perhaps she was right; for it is certain that for several minutes, neither
Edward nor Michael were fully conscious where they were, not who
they might be-that were near them. Once and again each beating heart
was strained against the brother heart, and then, their right hands
clasped, and the left placed, each on the other's shoulder,
tHey fell to such perusal of the face,''
that now, after eight cruel years of absence, was one more beaming
with love and sympathy before their eyes, that it must have been a
very heartless and soulless being who should have come between them.
Though such a history as Michael's might well have occupied more
than one long summer's day in the telling, to years so greedy of every
circumstance connected with it as were those of Edward, yet it is won-
derful how very short a time sufficed to point out the keystone of the.
arch, upon which the whole wonderful fabric hung, and then it was that
Fanny Fletcher's voice was heard exclaiming in a burst of control-
able emotion,
 Then it was IN that caused it all. Oh1 Miss Brotherton, it was 1
who kept him in that horrid place for years1 Had I not told you he
was dead, it would have been he who would have been the happy ob-
ject of your bounty, instead of me: Oh1 how can he ever forgive
me e
This was uttered with such agitated rnpidity, that though there was
more than one present, who would have been ready enough to contra-
diet the seif-accusing statement, she gave them no time for it. BUt
it suffices to draw Michael from the side of his brother, and to place
him at her: and though this terrible thought drew a shower of tears
from Fanny's eyes, notwithstanding the exceeding happiness which
was at the very same moment throbbing at her heart; it may be that
there would not have been found a more ineffectual mode of at once
bringing back the long-parted Friends to the same tone of familiar in-
intercourse in which they had parted, as this sincere self-recrimination
on one part, and the warm pleading against its injustice, on the other.
For some minutes this lasted without being interrupted by a word
from any one; for both Mary and Edward found, sufficient occupation
in looking at them both, and then exchanging expressive glances of
thanksgiving and happiness with each other. But at length, pon
Fanny's saying with a fresh burst of tears,

Oh, Michael 1 Michael your eloquence is all in vain. You
will never, never teach me to forget that I have been enjoying the
blessed destiny intended for you, aril that by ricans of words uttered
hy myself'
Upon her saying this, the happy Mary Brotherton pushed a low ta-
ouret before the reunited friends, and seating herself on it, took
any's hand in less, and said,  If you would not cry about it, my
Fanny, I should think it was a mighty pretty exhibition of true feeling
and false argument that we were witnessing: but if you really intend
to be unhappy, we shall all range ourselves immediately on Michael's
side, and laugh you to scorn for your sophistry, and the deplorable
confusion you are making between cause and effect. I should like to
know, little lady, how much it would have profited our Michael had
you refused to answer when I inquired at the Deep Valley factory, if
you know caught about him had you, while firmly believing he was
dead, declined to state your belief, lest you might be mistaken, what
would i have vanilla him, darling? Could he have crept down be-
for us from his sick bed to settle the question? No, dear assist
you know better. Your looks are much more wise than your words,
Fanny; for even no, though you pretend to shake your head, your
truth-telling eyes confess that you have not another syllabic to
say.''
 it is it not singular,'' said Martha, who had been contemplating
the scene with unspeakable delight, '`is it not singular that Michael
should twice have been the victim of words, uttered by such very
friendly lipe?'
 Singular, dear Martha?'' replied Mary; ``is not every 'event
connected with a hero of romance, of necessity and by immutable
prescription, singular ? And whom did Fate and Fortune ever fix upon
more unmistakably to fill that distinguished position in society, than
MIchael Armstrong? Why are we all here together7 Wholly and
solely because michael Armstrong saved Lady Clarissa Sharpton
from the terrors inspired by a cow-is it not so, dear friends' Can
any of you deny that all the exceeding happiness that blesses us at
this moment, has arisen from that most mnarvellously silly adventure ?
And shall we any of us quarrel at the steps (though some of them it
must be confessed were rough enough), which have led from that non-
sensible beginning, to an end that has made us all so very hapy
Yes1 Michael Armstrong is a hero; ha is our hero; he is the crowning
blessing that is home to make us all thank Heaven for having brought
us every one from greater and less degrees of misery, to very perfect
happiness, and shall we not welcome him with smiles, instead of tears,
Fanny ?''
Nothing could have been more admirably suited to the effect which
the happy heiress meant to produce, than these vrds. How, after
this, could Michael shrink, as he had expected to do, for the humid-.
lifting comparison between Edward and Fanny, with himself? O
how could Fanny persist in weeping, when her on heart, as well as
those of all around her, was so cheecriogly called upon to rejoice?
Nothing of the sort was any longer thought of by either.

How very odd,'' murmured the old lady, drawing her knitting
from her bag.
It is very odd, MIrs. Teletext, very odd indeed,'' said MAry,
there is no denying it. But the fact is, that Mr. Armstrong has
taken such an extraordinary fancy to this young man, that I really
think I shall be obliged to ask him to live with us. There will be
plenty of room, you know, in my Rhenish castle,''
The old lady said not a word in reply, but she looked puzzled, and
vexed, and shook her head, as much as to say that it was not like her
young mistress to talk such nonsense as that. So in her own defence
Mary was obliged to explain the mystery, and as happy an old woman
was nurse Teletext, as she looked and listened, as ever tasted joy from
the contemplation of it in others.
cHAPTER XXIII.
A TETE-l-TETE-A EC0ND---A TIMID---A MYSTEROS BEST-
colLINS1ON,
D BALlioL as was this state of mind to all that shared it, it could
not last. Michael was too much in earnest in his dream of being a
burden upon Miss Brotherton to permit many days to pass before he
begged her to let him converse with her for a few moments in private;
and Mary, who had already seen quite enough to convince her that
the affection which Michael and Fanny had conceived for each other,
amidst the dreary misery of the Deep Valley Mill, was not likely to
be forgotten in the gay happiness of Nice, fully anticipated an humble
confession, on the part of Michael, that he could not be happy without
her permission to become the acknowledged lover of her charming
friend and protegee, and very amiable, frank, and noble-minded, did
she consider it in him, thus openly to avow the truth at once. bUt
nothing could be further from the thoughts of Michael than making
any such confession as this; which, it stay be observed, is by no
means saying that his heart was either innocent or unconscious of the
presumptuous passion she attributed to it.
Greatly, however, lid Miss Brotherton underrate the young man's
character when she conceived that he gracious favour with which she
had received him, could generate in his heart a wish to ask for
Ore.
It is taking a great liberty, madam,'' began Michael.
If you love me, do not call me madam, my denr Michael,'' she
replied.  Do you not perceive that award and Fanny both call me
s80

MAry? and till I had taught them to do so i never could feel that they
quite understood the true spirit of my attachment towards them, or
the mode and manner of existence which I have imagined for myself,
and which must have fallen to the ground, if I had found them in-
capable of being to me, or letting me be to them, all that I wished and
desired. ou must not, dearest Michael, come and shake this per-
fect and delightful union, introducing forms and ceremonies foreign to
our manners, and or feelings. Pray do not look so grave, denr
friend2 Promise to offend thus no more, and I will cease to scold
you,'
Dearest Miss Brotherton 1'' said Michael. But this did not satisfy
the eugene lady, who shook her head, and held up her finger ire-
proof.  Dearest Mary when -'' he resumed, colouring brightly,
and with a smile that made her think she could trace a family likeness
to EDward, ' the greatest wish I have on earth is to become such as
you might approve, and if 1 shrink from the year and precious fame-
library which must make Elward and Fanny so happy, think not that
i am incapable of loving you as perfectly as they do; but remember,
dearest lady that however humble their origin, the very circumstance
of their having been your honoured companions for years, is of itself
sufficient to raise them to such a tone of thinking and of manners, as
may, in some sort, justify their using the privilege you so graciously
afford. But, alas: You must know too well that the case is far
different with me. The overflowing joy of our first meeting, naturally
broke down, as it were, all inequalities, all boundaries, and I certainly
felt, and perhaps spoke, as if 1 too were one of the accomplished little
circle that might call this earthly paradise their lome. But reflection
will come, most generous Mar 1 if not amidst the happy intoxicating
moments of the day, it will make itself a voice in the quiet reasoning
meditations of the night, and so loudly has this voice been heard
by me, that i cannot--no, in spite of all the happiness that sur-
rounds me, i cannot live on thus, an idle, ignorant dependant on
your bounty.''
The heiress was half vexed, but more than half plensel by this
trembling address, the deep sincerity of which was testified by the
working features of a countenance more than commonly expressive of
all that passed within. She had enjoyed so much genuine happiness
since the arrival of Michael, and had watched with pleasure so ex-
visited the happiness of Edward and Fanny, that she almost trembled
at the idea of any change: yet she knew the boy was right; she knew
that he ought to apply himself immediately and strenuously to such
studies as were most necessary for the redeeming the time he had lost,
and so well aware was she of this, that, notwithstanding her unwell-
igness to part with him, she rejoiced heartily to find that she] was
Wrong as to the subject of which she had suspected he wished to speak.
ILiad she been right in her conjecture, all she could have done would
have been to endow the boy and girl with such a portion of her wealth
as might have sufficed to make them independent; but under such

circumstances, all notion of essential improvement must of course be
abandoned for ever, and for many reasons this would have been a
source of lasting regret to her. It was therefore with cordial approx-
bation that after the interval of a few moments, she replied,  MIicliael,
you are right. Nature has done so much for you, my dear friend,
that our wish to keep you constantly with us might easily, had you
shown less courage, have tempted us to fancy that you wanted nothing
which you have not got or which we could not give you. bUt you
are quite right in refusing to consent to this. We will immediately
return to Germany where you shall be placed at the same admirable
institution that so rapidly made your brother what you now see him.
Two years of well-directed devotion to study, my der Michael, will
perhaps make you feel more at your ease among us, though I doubt,
if it can produce any change which will make us love you better.
 MIss Brotherton  dearest Miss Brotherton I'' exclaimed Michael
-while perhaps the brightest beam of hope that ever yet shot from
his eyes, met her as she affectionately gazed upon him, `' that was
not what I-what I dared venture to hope and ask for. What you
now propose, would be a happiness, the idea of which I think I should
have turned from, even in my dreams, from shame at its towering am-
tion. All I meant to ask was, your kind aid to place me in some
business where I might earn a maintenance, that in a year or two
might prevent my being a burden to you-and now-''
 And now, Michael, I tell you fairly, that I have not the slightest
intention of doing any such thing. Desires my own particular ob-
section to such a mode of proceeding, I have lately heard a little
anecdote of you, from your friend Martha, which makes it very
doubtful whether you deserve that species of independence-for she put
it in your possession once, you know-and you could not keep it. I
shall manage better, MIchael, depend upon it. One week more of
illness in this sweet spot-and then we travel back to Germany.
Yon shall not be left to study in a more forsaken condition than was
your brother. We shall be within an easy distance of you, my dear
Michael. One corner of my castle must hold us, while another i
beautified, and it is likely enough the work will go on all the better for
our being there.''
``And your visit to Rome gien up for my sake?'' cried Michael.
 Oh? no, no, no I''
No, no, na, most certainly,'' replied Mary, laughing, ' I would
not give up that journey, Michael, for more than I will sy,
AIR is not lost that is played.'
Instead of giving up the plan, I only mean to improve it. Tell
me, and tell me honestly, dear Michael, to you not think in your heart
that we shall, one and all, enjoy this journey more if you are with
us ?
Mary'' exclaimed the boy, wholly overcome, and seizing ane
kissing her hand with an emotion that at once and for ever banished
all reserve, ` Mary1 it is your will to be loved, and who cain disobeyd
382

But my happiness seems greater than i can hear? Where is Ed-
ward? Let me walk, and talk with him: He is used to you, Mary,
and all this may not seem to him so very much like a dream as it
does to me. If he tells me it is all real, I shall believe it;'' and with
these words, and his fine face glowing with all the best and happiest
feelings of our nature, mIchael bounded from the presence of his
Denefactress to seek his brother.
I might have lied a good while in my fine house, at Millard, and
received a prodigious number of complimentary visits from my elegant
neighbours, before I should have enjoyed half an hour as I have done
this,'' thought the happy Mary Brotherton, as she strolled out through
an open window, that led to a little garden of orange-trees.   How
delicious is the air this morning'' But where was the climate, where,
at that moment, she would have felt it to be otherwise ?
Michael had no difficulty in finding his brother, who in truth was
lingering near, on purpose to question him after this interview.
 Come with me, edward I'' tried the agitated boy, seizing his
arm; t here are our hats-come with me into thatlittle grove monde
--my heart will burst if I do not instantly tell you what has passe.''
And arm-in-arm they crossed the road, and a small enclosure op-
polite, and there found themselves under the shelter of a little wood,
thick enough to exclude the peering eyes of mortals, as well as that of
the sun.
Notwithstanding their eagerness for the communication which was
to follow, and which was pretty equally strong in both, not a word was
uttered by either till they reached this convert, and then, MIchael,
throwing himself upon a bank, and casting his hat away, clasped his
hands, and raising his eyes to heaven, exclaimed,  Edward, she is an
angel:
Edward had not followed his brother's example, in lying down, but
stood before him in act to listen. But there was something in these
words that seemed to shake it, for he turned away without answer-
in
 Has she ever named to you her plans about me?'' resumed Mi-
chapel.
Yes' replica Edward.
 Then you know that it is not her intention to assist me, by en-
ailing me to learn any trade in handicraft''
 No such idea, Michael, ever entered her head,'' said Edward,
gravely.
 But, my dear fellow you seem to take all this so very coolly.
Do you know that it is her intention to send me to the same place
where your education was completed ?-dO you know that she gives
up-to-that she postpones her journey to italy, till I am ready togo
with her ?-Edward, do you know all this?''
 MIy dear brother,'' replied Edward,'' I only know, that from the
moment she learnt you were alive, she determined that she would im-
mediately make you perfectly independent, as she has done me. All
the rest, I think, depended upon your own inclination-and had the

not found you disposed for this scheme, she would not have insisted
on it.'
 Disposed for it, Edward? Oh1 what cold, what chilling words%
you could not speak so, if you thought there were any hope of my so
profiting by it as to become a fit companion for you-for her-for
Fanny. bUt it is too late-you feel that it is too late-is it not so,
Edward:
 No, Michael, no1'' returned Edward, with sudden animation.
 With your faculties, your eager desire to learn, and the masters you
will have to put you in the way of doing so, I of that the result of
these two years of study will be all you wish, and all your friends can
desire.''
t Then how can you receive this glorious nes, my Edward, so com-
secondly?'
 First, dear MIchael, because it is no news to me. And secondly,
because I am a selfish wretch, and was thinking, perhaps, more of my
own interest than of yours. Forgive me for it, my own dear Michael 1
But I would rather have had it decided that we should have both
marched off, and taken service under the Emperor of Austria. I
know that commissions would have been obtained for us,''
Michael, as his brother uttered these words, looked up into his face
with an expression of such astonishment and dismay, that the blood
rushed to Edwards face and he turned away to conceal his con-
fusion.
 Reward1 you are a mystery to me,'' exclaimed Michael, spring-
ing on his feet, and taking his brother by the arm. ` Can it be
possible that you are weary of the life you lead Of, heaven: and
such a life
 Scary? am I weary of it, Michael? earl of rising every day to
feel that I am a wretch unworthy to breathe the breath of life and
where? And ohl how utterly unworthy to breathe it here1''
It was now poor Michael's turn to change colour, and he did so
pretty violently-for first he became very red, and then exceedingly
pale. That Elward, such as he had ever remembered him, such as
he found him now, that he should so very solemnly declare himself to
be a wretch unworthy of life, was a horror and a misery as terrible as
it was unexpected. IIe had no power to utter any soothing in con-
tradition to this appalling statement, for, alas it might be true-and
Michael's heart sunk within him as he remembered how totally ignorant
he was of every thing that might enable him to disbelieve it. Silently
the brothers walked on for some paces, side by side. They were both
of them either unwilling, or unable to speak. At length a sort of shut-
during emotion that passed through Michael's fame, made itself felt
bY the arm of Edward, which he still held, and then he stopped, and
without raising his eyes from the ground, said
 Michael1 How is it you understand me? Do you suppose that
I have been guilty of some criminal act, such as doors man to the
gallows? Not, why do you shudder thus''
384
rIE LIE AD ADvENtURE
 Would you not shudder, Edward, if you heard me say, that I
as a wretch unworthy to lite '
Poor Michael1 perhaps I might; but still I doubt if I should
understand the phrase as you do. It is so difficult, to impossible to
express temperature and soberly, my own reprobation of the feelings
that destroy me: And yet, lear mIchael,'' he continued more tran-
quill, : I could have fancied that there was something working in
your own heart which might have taught or in some degree to guess
the state of mine-I have no strength, no courage to enter on the
guilty subject fully-but-that you may not think me a felon, MIchael,
I will tell you in once audacious word, I of, and that with a fervour,
a vehemence of passion, that often makes me tremble at myself-for
did it ever master me so far as to force a confession of it in the
presence of its object, I never could look up again, but must and
would for ever become an alien from all I love, and a friendless wan--
deer on the face of the earth,.''
Though shocked more deeply than he had any wish or power to
express, Michael could not resist the belief, which came with terrible
strength upon him, that his unhappy brother had conceived a passion
for some married woman, and that his best chance of recovering hoth
his virtue and his tranquillity would he by following the wish he had
expressed, and by entering on a new and active career, to give himself
a chance of obliterating from his mind the feelings which had so un-
happily taken possession of it. Such a destination for Elward must of
course destroy some the very brightest of his own beautiful day-dreams::
but there was a fund of integrity and real goodness in the heart of
Michael that permitted him not at that moment to think of himself.
t Elward 1'' said he solemnly,  if this be so, follow the course that
your better feelings have suggested-adopt at once the profession of
a soldier. It has ever been accounted a noble one--though, under
happier circumstances-but that matters not-if your passions have
led you song, let your principles bring you back again. Confess the
truth to your generous benefactors at once,''
Michael l'' replied Edward, looking in his face with an expression
of suffering that almost amounted to agony-``I would rather die]
first.'' These words seemed intended to close the conversation, or at
any rate they did so: for the two brothers silently retraced their
path to the house, and a fond pressure, expressive of love and pity,
which Michael gave to the war of ward before he parted to it,
was all that passed between them further at that time.
The interview of that morning with Miss Brotherton had awakened in]
the mind of Michael, feelings towards her which an hour before he]
would have thought it must have taken years to produce; but being]
equally sincere, both in his former timidity and his present confidence]
he speedily made up his mind to open his heart to her, and do for his:f
guilty, but suffering brother, what it was evident he had not courage]
to do for himself. In pursuant of this resolution, he again sough]
the heiress, and whispered in her ear, ` Mary 2-will you let me tall
to you a little more?'' She eagerly complied with the implied ia]

385
citation, and passing her arm through his, accompanied him to the
scene of their former tete--tite.
There was no shyness on the part of Michael. The familiar ap-
relations he had used was not assumed for the purpose of proving his
obedience, but resulted from a genuine feeling of affectionate con-
science in every word she had uttered, and which had left on his mind
the belief that she was not only his generous patroness, but his loving
friend.
I little thought when I was talking to you this morning about my
poor self,'' he said, `` that I should so soon have to take you away
again for your drawing, to talk about Elward.''
Aout Earl?'' said Mary colouring, `i what do you wish to
say about him, dear Michael ?''
t It is something that he declares he would die rather than say to yo
himself,'' replied Michael, " but i am certain that you ought to know
it, for it is quite clear that there is no chance of happiness for him
unless you agree to his wishes.''
WHat wishes?'' exclaimed the heiress, terribly agitated, `` for
goodness sake, Michael, do not trifle with mel Did Award commit-
sion you to speak to me?''
 OhIO, nol had he felt courage to do that, I should have told him
at once, that he had better do it himself,'' replied Michael. `` Indeed
I fear greatly that he will be displeased with me; but I cannot bear
to see him so miserable without mentioning it to the only person
capable of helping hin,''
Miserable %?-Helping him ?--ell me, Michael, tell me at once
what you mean 1'
`That is exactly what I wish to do, denr Mary I'' replied Michael
looking with considerable surprise at her varying colour, and agitated
features;``but I fear 1 am doing wrong, and that I have already
said something that vexes you,''
No, no:'' cried MAry impatiently, `only, go on t'
 In one word, then,'' resumed Michael, ``our dear Edward wishes
beyond all things to enter the Austrian service.''
 And leave us' returned the egress, almost gasping. `' Does
Edward want to leave me 2''
: Do not suspect him of ingratitude, Mary'' cried Michael, eagerly:
`there is a reason for it. and without this I am quite sure he would.
never think of such a thing.-Edward has conceived an unfortunate6
passion for an object from whom he ought to fly-and this, of course,
will explain every thing to you.''
Let me see him Let me hear him From himself, and from
himself only I can hcnr this. Let it mean what it may.'' On utter-
in these words, which were spoken with a very agitated and untran-
quit air, Mary robertson rushed out of the room, much to Michael's
astonishment; for he could by no means comprehend why she should
testify such very strong emotion, especially as he had so cautiously and
delicately avoided hinting any thing about a married woman's being
unhappily the object of his brother's passion.

nE LIE AND ADVENTuRES
In this ignorance or Michiel's, the reader, I am very sorry to say,
must share. There are some facts which no wise historian will ever ven-
ture to dilate upon, lest their strangeness should provoke incredulity;
and great wisdom is shown by such forhearance; for it is infinitely better
that an enlightened public should be driven to exclaim, ` IIow very
obscure this passage is ?'' than  How very improbable ''
Michael Armstrong is the hero of the book that is now drawing ra-
pidly to its conclusion: and every reader has therefore a right to ex-
pact that his destiny shall be plainly announced to them, whatever
mystery may hang over that of others. Whatever occurred between
the heiress and Edward in the conference which they speedily held
together, it did not cause any alteration in that lady's purpose of
immediately returning to her chateau on the line. A man of
worth and great ability was engaged to take charge of the richly
teeming eager ind of Michael, during the two years that it was
settled he should remain at a German university, and nothing could
be more satisfactory than the result of this arrangement. Never,
perhaps, were to years put to greater profit in the development of
mind, than upon this occasion: and when they were ended, Michael
Armstrong was able to take his station upon the beautiful terrace, with-
out feeling that he was out of his place there.
Less than these two years had sufficed to bring to perfection all
Mary Brotherton's plans for improving and eautifying her spacious
residence. It was one of those super-terrance quarries which are
sometimes seen to spread themselves to such miraculous extent in that
region, and would have inspired most ladies with a feeling of dreary
vastness, which, notwithstanding the exceeding beauty of its position,
would have prevented any hope of rendering it comfortably habitable.
But Mary had an ample heart, and an ample purse. Circumstances
over which (to use a thoroughly authorized expression) she had no
control, for in truth they hd preceded her birth, had rendered he
own country less dear to her than it is to most others; and she
therefore not only determined to plant herself elsewhere, but to do
so in such a manner as would enable her to make her new abode her
home, in the best sense of the word, and this could only be done by
giving
Ample room, and merge enough,''
to make it the home of others also. Any travellers lucky enough to
light upon this widely-spreading, but comfortable and thoroughly well
kept-up abode, will find that, notwithstanding its great extent, it has,
by no means, the air of being uninhabited. Nobody will be much
surprised to hear that Michael Armstrong and Fanny Fletcher headed
man and wife, or that they proved a loving and very happy pair: bu,
should any curious henish tourist obtain an introduction to this
Rushing paradise, they will probably observe two very loving and happy
pair, to whom it serves as a common yet, in some sort,a separate
home, each having its suite of drawing-rooms, boudoirs, nurseries,
school-rooms, etctera., BUt however much a gossiping inclination

nigh lead to a more explicit detail, there is really no room left to enter
on it. All that can be said in addition to this is, that when Sir
Matthew Dowling's affairs came to the wound np, there was discovered
to be a sufficient surplus to afford a small independence to each of his
children, which, being divided according to the proportion dictated by
the knight's will, gave something approaching to a benjamin's mess por-
tion to his daughter Martha. To claim and receive this, as well as of-
occasionally to visit some members of her family, Martha made frequent
excursions to England; but her happiest hours were those she passed
with her dear friends in Germany, by whom she is ever received with
open arms.
MIrs. Teletext is still enjoying an old age of perfect comfort, cheered
by warm affection, and is already the darling of many little hearts.
There is no record to be found in any documents relating to the
inhabitants of the chateau, showing that Edward Armstrong ever
entered the Austrian service. It is, therefore, most reasonable to
suppose that this wish was never complied with.

oPINIONS OF THE PRESS.
 Sir James Alexander' Life of Wellington has the treble advantage of being the
cheapest-of inserting a large portion of the original correspondence-and of con-
denying within popular limits the dry military details''- Stole
 can safely recommend his important and promising publication to our
enders.''-Naal aid Military Gazette
 The sale and ell-selected arrangement of the details this valuable work are
in every respect commensurate with the worth of the noble and gallant ero of which
it treats.''--MArder,
 The work is likely to have a religious circulation. I1 ilI probably contain the
most complete, correct, n teutonic details of the aventful life of this exalted here
profound statesman, and patriotic alitieian,''-ath LIberal.
Sir James Alexander possesses every requisite for this great undertaking. lng
himself a soldier, he can depict graphically tie class and changes of that Fifa of oil
and danger, and in the technical details of military enterprise he is of course superior
to the uninitiated. Having had access to many exclusive sources of information, and
being honoured, as ve understand, by personal interests with the nohlo Dke, loss
MEmoirs le edits, we naturally conclude that is work will he peculiarly practice.
Na doubt can be entertained tat, wen completed, it will aobtin a prominent place in
the leary of those to whose hearts lei country's glory is denr, and be received as
 standard work in all miliary circles.''-Dublin Meeting Packet.
