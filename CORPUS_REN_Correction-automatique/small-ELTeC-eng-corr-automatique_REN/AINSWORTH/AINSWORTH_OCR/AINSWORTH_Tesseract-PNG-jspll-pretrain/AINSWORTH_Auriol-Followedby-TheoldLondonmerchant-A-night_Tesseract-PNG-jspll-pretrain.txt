AURIOL.

Prologue—1599.
DR. LAMB.

The Sixteenth Century drew to a close. It was the last
day of the last year, and two hours only were wanting to
the birth of another year and of another century.

The night was solemn and beautiful. Myriads of start
paved the deep vault of heaven; the crescent moon hung
like a silver lamp in the midst of them; a stream of rosy
and quivering light issuing from the north traversed the
sky, like the tail of some stupendous comet; while from
its point of affluence broke forth, ever and anon, coastal-
tions rivalling in splendour and variety of hue the most
brilliant discharge of fireworks.

A sharp frost prevailed; but the atmosphere was clear
and dry, and neither wind nor snow aggravated the whole-
some rigour of the season. The water lay in thick gon-
sealed masses around the conduits and wells, and the
buckets were frozen on their stands. The thoroughfares

B

were greeted with ice, and dangerous to horsemen and
vehicles ; but the foodways were firm and pleasant to the
tread.

Here and there, a fire was lighted in the streets, round
which ragged urchins and mendicants were collected, roast-
ing fragments of meat stuck upon iron prongs ; or quaffing
deep draghts of metheglin and are, out of leather cups.
Crowds were collected in the open places, watching the
wonders in the heavens, and drawing auguries from them,
chiefly sinister, for most of the beholder thought the signs
shortened the speedy death of the queen, and the advent
of a new monarch from the north—a safe and easy inter-
predation, considering the advanced age and declining health
of the illustrious Elizabeth, together with the known ap-
ointment of her successor, James of Scotland.

Notwithstanding the early habits of the times, few persons
had retired to rest, an universal wish prevailing among the
citizens to see the new year in, and welcome the century ac-
companying it. Lights immersed in most windows, re-
dealing the holly-sprigs and laurel-leaves stuck thickly in
their diamond panes; while, whenever a door was opened, a
ruddy gleam burst across the street; and a glance inside
the dwelling showed its inmates either gathered round the
glowing hearth, occupied in mirthfal sports—fox-i'-th’-
hole, blind-man’s-buff, or shoe-the-mare—or seated at the
ample board groaning with Christmas cheer.

Music and singing were heard at every corner, and bands
of comely damsels, escorted by their sweethearts, went
from house to house, bearing age brown bowls dressed

with ribalds and rosemary, and filled with a drink called
“Jamb’s-wool,” composed of sturdy ale, sweetened with
sugar, spiced with nutmeg, and having toasts and burnt
crabs floating within it,—a draught from which seldom
brought its pretty bearers less than a great, and occasion=
ally a more valuable coin.

Such was the vigil of the year Sixteen Hundred.

On this night, and at the tenth hour, a man of striking
and venerable appearance was seen to emerge upon a small
wooden balcony, projecting from a day-window near the top
of a picturesque structure situated at the southern ex-
treaty of London-bridge.

The old man’s beard and hair were as white as snow—
the former descending almost to his girdle; so were the
thick overhanging brows that shaded his still piercing
eyes. His forehead was high, bald, and ploughed by innu-
merable wrinkles. His countenance, despite its death-like
paleness, had a noble and majestic cast, and his figure,
though worn to the one by a life of the severest study,
and bent by the weight of years, must have been once lofty
and commanding. His dress consisted of a double and
those of sad-coloured cloth, over which he wore a loose
gown of black silk. His head was covered by a square
Black cap, from beneath which his silver locks strayed over
his shoulders.

Known by the name of Doctor Lamb, and addicted to
alchemical and philosophical pursuits, this venerable person-
age was esteemed by the vulgar as little better than a
wizard. Strange tales were reported and believed of him.

4 AURIOL,

Amongst others, it was said that he possessed a familiar,
because he chanced to employ a deformed, crack-trained
dwarf, who assisted him in his operations, and whom he
appropriately enough denominated Snapdragon.

Doctor Lamb's game was fixed intently upon the heavens,
and he seemed to be noting the position of the moon with
reference to some particular star.

After remaining in this posture for a few minutes, he was
about to retire, when a loud crash arrested him, and he
turned to see whence it proceeded.

Immediately before him stood the Southwark Gateway—
a square stone building, with a round, embattled turret at
each corner, and a flat, leaden roof, planted with a forest
of poles, fifteen or sixteen feet high, garnished with human
heads. To his surprise, the doctor perceived that two of
these poles had just been overthrown by a tall man, who
was in the act of stripping them of their grisly burdens.

Having accomplished his object, the mysterious planderer
thrust his spoil into a leather bag with which he was pro-
video, tied its mouth, and was about to take his departure
by means of a rope-ladder attached to the battlements,
when his retreat was suddenly cut off by the gatekeeper,
armed with a halberd, and bearing a lantern, who issued
from a door opening upon the leads.

The baffled marauder looked round, and remarking the
open window at which Doctor Lamb was stationed, hurled
the sack and its contents through it. He then tried to
gain the ladder, but was intercepted by the gatekeeper,
who dealt him a severe blow on the head with his halberd,

 

 

 

DR. LAMB. 5

The plunderer uttered a loud cry, and attempted to draw
his sword; but before he could do so, he received a thrust
in the side from his opponent. He then fell, and the gate-
keeper would have repeated the blow, of the doctor had not
called to him to desist.

“Do not kill him, good Baldred,” he cried. “ The
attempt may not be so criminal as it appears. Doubtless,
the mutilated remains which the poor wretch has attempted
to carry off, are those of his kindred, and horror at their
exposure must have led him to commit the offence.”

“It may be, doctor,” replied Baldred; “ and if so I shall
be sorry I have hurt him. But I am responsible for the
safe custody of these traitorous relics, and it is as much as
my own head is worth to permit their removal.”

“T know it,” replied Doctor Lamb; “and you are fully
justified in what you have done. It may throw some light
upon the matter, to know whose miserable remains have
been disturbed.”

“They were the heads of two rank papists,” replied
Baldred, “ who were decapitated on Tower Hill, on Saint
Nicholas’s day, three weeks ago, for conspiring against the
queen.”

“But their names?” demanded the doctor. ‘ How
were they called ?”

“They were father and son,” replied Baldred ;—* Sir
Simon Darcy and Master Reginald Darcy. Perchance
they were known to your worship ?”

“Too well—too well!” replied Doctor Lamb, in a voice
of emotion, that startled bis hearer. “They were near

 

 

 

6 AURIOL.

kinsmen of mine own. What is he like who has made this
strange attempt ?”

“Of a verity, a fair youth,” replied Baldred, holding
down the lantern. “ Heaven grant I have not wounded
him to the death! No, his heart still beats. Ha! here
are his tablets,” he added, taking a small book from his
doublet; “these may give the information you seek. You
were right in your conjecture, doctor. The name herein
inscribed is the same as that borne by the others —Auriol
Darcy.”

“T see it all,” cried Lamb. “ It was a pious and praise-
worthy deed. Bring the unfortunate youth to my dwelling,
Baldred, and you shall be well rewarded. Use despatch, I
pray you.”

As the gatekeeper essayed to comply, the wounded man
groaned deeply, as if in great pain.

“Fling me the weapon with which you smote him,”
cried Doctor Lamb, in accents of commiseration, “and I
will anoint it with the power of sympathy. Lis anguish
will be speedily abated.”

“TO know your worship can accomplish wonders,” cried
Baldred, throwing the halberd into the balcony. “I will
do my part as gently as I can.”

And as the alchemist took up the weapon, and disappeared
through the window, the gatekeeper lifted the wounded
man by the shoulders, and conveyed him down a narrow
winding staircase to a lower chamber. Though he pro-
ceded carefully, the sufferer was put to excruciating pain ;
and when Baldred placed him on a wooden bench, and held

 

 

 

 

DR. LAMB. 7

a lamp towards him, he perceived that his features were
darkened and distorted.

“T fear it’s all over with him,” murmured the gatekeeper;
“T shall have a dead body to take to Doctor Lamb. It
would be a charity to knock him on the head, rather than
let him suffer thus. The doctor passes for a cunning man,
but if he can cure this poor youth without seeing him, by the
help of his sympathetic ointment, I shall begin to believe,
what some folks avouch, that he has relations with the
devil.”

While Baldred was ruminating in this manner, a sudden
and extraordinary change took place in the sufferer. As
if by magic, the contraction of the muscles subsided; the
features assumed a wholesome he, and the respiration was
no longer laborious. Baldred stared as if a miracle had
been wrought.

Now that the countenance of the youth had regained its
original expression, the gatekeeper could not help being
struck by its extreme beauty. The face was a perfect
oval, with regular and delicate features. A short silken
moustache covered the upper lip, which was short and
proud, and a pointed beard terminated the chin. The hair
was black, glossy, and cut short, so as to disclose a highly
intellectual expanse of brow.

The youth's figure was slight, but admirably proportioned.
His attire consisted of a black satin doublet, slashed with
white, house of black silk, and a short velvet mantle. His
eyes were still closed, and it was difficult to say what effect
they might give to the face when they lighted it up; but

 

 

8 AURIOL.

notwithstanding its beauty, it was impossible not to admit
that a strange, sinister, and almost demoniacal expression
pervaded the countenance.

All at once, and with as much suddenness as his cure
had been effected, the young man started, uttering a
piercing cry, and placed his hand to his side.

“ Cardiff!” he cried, fixing his blazing eyes on the gate-
keeper, “why do you torture me thus? Finish me at once
—Oh!”

And overcome by anguish, he sank back again.

“T have not touched yon, sir,” replied Baldred. “I
brought you here to succour you. You will be easier anon.
Doctor Lamb must have wiped the halberd,” he added to
himself.

Another sudden change. The pain fled from the sun-
fewer's countenance, and he became easy as before.

“ What have you done to me?” he asked, with a look of
gratitude; “ the torture of my wound has suddenly ceased,
and I feel as if a balm had been dropped into it. Let me
remain in this state if you have any pity—or despatch me,
for my late agony was almost insupportable.”

“ You are cared for by one who has greater skill than
any chirurgeon in London,” replied Baldred. “If I can
manage to transport you to his lodgings, he will speedily
heal your wounds.”

“Do not delay, then,” replied Auriol, faintly; “ for
though I am free from pain, I feel that my life is ebbing
fast away.”

“ Press this handkerchief to your side, and lean on me,”

 

 

DB. LAMB. 9

said Baldred. “ Doctor Lamb’s dwelling is but a step from
the gateway—in fact, the first house on the bridge. By
the way, the doctor declares he is your kinsman.”

“It is the first I ever heard of him,’ replied Auriol,
faintly; “but take me to him quickly, or it will be too
late.”

In another moment they were at the doctor's door.
Baldred tapped against it, and the summons was instantly
answered by a diminutive personage, clad in a perkin of
coarse grey serge, and having a leather apron tied round
his waist. This was Snapdragon.

Clear-eyed, smoke-begrimed, lantern-jawed, the poor
dwarf seemed as if his whole life had been spent over the
furnace. And so, in fact, it had been. He had become
little better than a pair of human bellows. In his hand he
held the halberd with which Auriol had been wounded.

“ So you have been playing the leech, Snapdragon, eh?”
cried Baldred.

“ Ay, marry have I,” replied the dwarf, with a wild grin,
and displaying a wolfish set of teeth. “ My master ordered
me to smear the halberd with the sympathetic ointment. I
obeyed him; rubbed the steel point, first on one side, then
on the other; next wiped it; and then smeared it again.”

“ Whereby you put the patient to exquisite pain,” re-
plied Baldred; “ but help me to transport him to the la-
oratory.”

“ I know not if the doctor will care to be disturbed,” said
Snapdragon. “ He is busily engaged on a grand operation,”

“ J will take the risk on myself,” said Baldred. “ The

youth will die if he remains here. ce, he has fainted al-
ready!”

Thus urged, the dwarf laid down the halberd, and be-
given the two, Auriol was speedily conveyed up a wide
taken staircase to the laboratory. Doctor Lamb was playing
the bellows at the furnace, on which a large alembic was
placed, and he was so engrossed by his task, that he scarcely
noticed the entrance of the others.

“Place the youth on the ground, and rear his head
against the chair,” he cried, hastily, to the dwarf. “ Bathe
his brows with the decoction in that crucible. I will attend
to him anon. Come to me on the morrow, Baldred, and I
will repay thee for the trouble. I am busy now.”

“ These relics, doctor,” cried the gatekeeper, glancing at
the bag, which was lying on the ground, and from which a
bald head protruded—“I ought to take them back with
me.”

“Bleed them not—they will be safe in my keeping,”
cried Doctor Lamb, impatiently; “ to-morrow—to-morrow.”

Casting a further glance round the laboratory, and shrug-
ging his shoulders, Baldred departed; and Snapdragon
having bathed the sufferer’s temples with the decoction, in
obedience to his master’s injunctions, turned to inquire
what he should do next.

« Bygone!” cried the doctor, so fiercely that the dwarf
darted out of the room, clapping the door after him.

Doctor Lamb then applied himself to his task with re-
need armour, and in a few seconds became wholly insen-
bible of the presence of a stranger.

 

 

DR. LAMB. 11

Revived by the stimulant, Auriol presently opened his
eyes, and gazing round the room, thought he must be
dreaming, so strange and fantastical did all appear. The
floor was covered with the implements used by the adept—
bolt-heads, crucibles, cucurbit, and retorts, scattered about
without any attempt at arrangement. In one corner was a
large terrestrial sphere ; near it was an astrolabe; and near
that a heap of disused glass vessels. On the other side, lay
a black, mysterious-looking book, fastened with brazen
clasps. Around it, were a ram's horn, a pair of forceps, a
roll of parchment, a pestle and mortar, and a large plate of
copper, graven with the mysterious symbols of the Islamic
table. Near this was the leather bag containing the two
decapitated heads, one of which had burst forth. On a
table, at the farther end of the room, stood a large open
volume, with parchment leaves, covered with cabalistical
characters, referring to the names of spirits. Near it were
two parchment scrolls, written in letters, respectively deno-
minted by the Chaplain sages, “ the Malachi,” and “the
Passing of the River.” One of these scrolls was kept in
its place by a skull. An ancient and grotesque-looking
brass lamp, with two snake-headed burners, lighted the
room. From the ceiling depended a huge scaly sea-monster,
with outspread fins, open jaws, garnished with tremendous
teeth, and great goggling eyes. Near it hung a celestial
sphere. The chimney-piece, which was curiously carved,
and projected far into the room, was Jaden with various im-
elements of Hermetic science. Above it were hung dried
bats and litter-mice, interspersed with the skulls of birds

and apes. Attached to the chimney-piece was a horary,
sculptured in stone, near which hung a large star-fish. The
fireplace was occupied by the furnace, on which, as has been
stated, was placed an alembic, communicating by means of
a long serpentine pipe with a receiver. Within the room
were two skeletons, one of which, placed behind a curtain
in the deep erasure of the window, where its polished
bones glistened in the white moonlight, had a horrible
effect. The other enjoyed more comfortable quarters near
the chimney, its freshness feet dangling down in the smoke
arising from the furnace.

Doctor Lamb, meanwhile, steadily pursued his task,
though he ever and anon paused, to fling certain roots and
drugs upon the charcoal. As he did this, various-coloured
flames broke forth—now blue, now green, now blood-red.

Tinged by these fires, the different objects in the chamber
seemed to take other forms, and to become instinct with
animation. The gourd-shaped cucurbites were transformed
into great bloated toads bursting with venom; the long-
necked bolt-heads became monstrous serpents; the worm-
like pipes turned into adders; the embodies looked like
plumes helmets; the characters on the Islamic table, and
those on the parchments, seemed traced in fire, and to be
ever changing ; the sea-monster bellowed and roared, and,
flapping his fins, tried to burst from his book; the she-
lemons wagged their jaws, and raised their freshness fingers
in mockery, while blue lights burnt in their eyeless sockets ;
the bellows became a prodigious bat fanning the fire with

 

 

 

DR. LAMB. 13

its wings ; and the old alchemist assumed the appearance of
the arch-fiend presiding over a witches’ sabbath.

Auriol's brain reeled, and he pressed his hand to his
eyes, to exclude these phantasms from his sight. But
even thus they pursued him; and he imagined he could
hear the infernal riot going on around him.

Suddenly, he was roused by a loud joyful try, and, un-
covering his eyes, he beheld Doctor Lamb pouring the con-
tents of the matrass—a bright, transparent liquid—into a
small phil. Having carefully secured the bottle with a
glass stopper, the old man held it towards the light, and
gazed at it with rapture.

“ At length,” he exclaimed aloud—“ at length, the great
work is achieved. With the birth of the century now ex-
hiring I first saw light, and the draught I hold in my hand
shall enable me to see the opening of centuries and cen-
tries to come. Composed of the lunar stones, the solar
stones, and the mercurial stones—prepared according to
the instructions of the Rabbi Ben Lucca,—namely, by the
separation of the pure from the impure, the volatilisation
of the fixed, and the fixing of the volatile; this elixir shall
renew my youth, like that of the eagle, and give me length
of days greater than any patriarch ever enjoyed.”

While thus speaking, he held up the sparkling liquid,
and gazed at it like a Persian worshipping the sun.

“ To live for ever!” he cried, after a pause—“ to escape
the jaws of death just when they are opening to devour
me!—to be free from all accidents!—'is a glorious

 

 

14 AURIOL.

thought! Ha! I rethink me, the rabbi said there was
one peril against which the elixir could not guard me—one
vulnerable point, by which, like the heel of Achilles, death
might reach me! What is it 7—where can it lie?”

And he relapsed into deep thought.

“This uncertainty will poison all my happiness,” he
continued ; “I shall live in constant dread, as of an ini-
bible enemy. But no matter! Perpetual life !—perpetual
youth !—what more need be desired ?”

“What more, indeed!” cried Auriol.

“Ha!” exclaimed the doctor, suddenly recollecting the
wounded man, and concealing the phil beneath his gown.

“ Your caution is vain, doctor,” said Auriol. ‘I have
heard what you have uttered. You fancy you have disco-
verde the elixir vite.”

“Fancy I have discovered it!” cried Doctor Lamb.
“The matter is past all doubt. Iam the possessor of the
wondrous secret, which the greatest philosophers of all
ages have sought to discover—the miraculous preservative
of the body against decay.”

“ The man who brought me hither told me you were my
kinsman,” said Auriol. “ Is it so ?”

“It is,” replied the doctor, “and you shall now learn the
connexion that subsists between us. Look at that ghastly
relic,” he added, pointing to the head protruding from the
bag, “that was once my son Simon. His son's head is
within the sack—your father’s head—so that four genera-
tions are brought together.”

“ Gracious Heaven!” exclaimed the young man, raising

 

 

 

DR. LAMB. 15

himself on his elbow. “You, then, are my great-grand-
sire. My father supposed you had died in his infancy. An
old tale runs in the family that you were charged with sor-
very, and fled to avoid the stake.”

“It is true that I fled, and took the name I bear at pre-
sent,” replied the old man, “but I need scarcely say that
the charge brought against me was false. I have devoted
myself to abstrusest science; have held commune with the
stars; and have wrested the most hidden secrets from
Nature—but that is all. Two crimes alone have stained
my soul, but both, I trust, have been expiated by re-
penance.”

“ Were they deeds of blood?” asked Auriol.

“ One was so,” replied Darcy, with a shudder. “It was
a cowardly and treacherous deed, aggravated by the basest
ingratitude. Listen, and you shall hear how it chanced.
A Roman rabbi, named Ben Lucca, skilled in Hermetic
science, came to this city. His fame reached me, and I
sought him out, offering myself as his disciple. For
months, I remained with him in his laboratory—working
at the furnace, and poring over mystic lore. One night, he
showed me that volume, and, pointing to a page within it,
said: ‘Those characters contain the secret of connecting
the elixir of life. I will now explain them to you, and
afterwards we will proceed to the operation.’ With this,
he unfolded the mystery ; but he made me observe, that the
menstrual was defective on one point. Wherefore, he said,
‘there will still be peril from some hidden cause.’ Oh,
with what readiness I drank in his words! How I gazed

 

 

 

16 AURIOL.

at the mystic characters, as he explained their import!
What visions floated before me of perpetual youth and en-
comment. At that moment a demon whispered in my ear,
—‘This secret must be thine own. No one else must
possess it.’ ”

« Ha!” exclaimed Auriol, starting.

“ The evil thought was no sooner conceived than acted
upon,” pursued Darcy. “ Instantly drawing my leonard,
I plunged it to the rabbi’s heart. But mark what followed.
Isis blood fell upon the book, and obliterated the chirac-
ters; nor could I by any effort of memory recall the com-
position of the elixir.”

“When did you regain the secret?” asked Auriol,
curiously.

“ To-night,” replied Darcy—* within this hour, For
nigh fifty years after that fatal night I have been making
fruitless experiments. A film of blood has obscured my
mental sight. I have proceeded by calibration, solution,
putrefaction—have produced the oils which will fix crude
mercury, and convert all bodies into sol and ]una; but I
have ever failed in fermenting the stone into the true elixir.
To-night, it came into my head to wash the blood-stained
page containing the secret with a subtle liquid. I did so;

 

and doubting the efficacy of the experiment, left it to work,
while I went forth to breathe the air at my window. My
eyes were cast upwards, and I was struck with the mali-
nant aspect of my star. How to reconcile this with the
good fortune which has just befallen me, I know not—but
soit was. At this juncture, your rash, but pious attempt

 

 

we

 

 

DR. LAMB, 17

occurred. Having discovered our relationship, and enjoined
the gatekeeper to bring you hither, I returned to my old
laboratory. On glancing towards the mystic volume, what
was my surprise to see the page free from blood !”

Auriol uttered a slight exclamation, and gazed at the
book with superstitious awe.

“ The sight was so surprising, that I dropped the sack I
had brought with me,” pursued Darcy. “ Fearful of again
losing the secret, I served myself to the task, and placing
fuel on the fire, dismissed my attendant with brief injury-
tions relative to you. I then set to work. How I have
succeeded, you perceive. I hold in my hand the treasure
I have so long sought—so eagerly coveted. The whole
world’s wealth should not purchase it from me.”

Auriol gazed earnestly at his aged relative, but he said
nothing.

“ In a few moments I shall be as full of vigour and ac-
activity as yourself,” continued Darcy. “We shall be no
longer the great-grandsire and his descendant, but friends
—companions—equals,—equals in age, strength, activity,
beauty, fortune—for youth is fortune—ha! ha! Thinks
I am already young again !”

“ You spoke of two crimes with which your conscience
was burdened,” remarked Auriol. ‘“ You have mentioned
but one.”

“The other was not so foul as that I have described,”
replied Darcy, in an altered tone, “inasmuch as it was an-
intentional, and occasioned by no base motive. My wife,
your ancestors, was a most lovely woman, and so passion-

o

lately was I enamoured of her, that 1 tried by every art to
heighten and preserve her beauty. I fed her upon the flesh
of canons, nourished with vipers; caused her to steep her
lovely limbs in baths distilled from roses and violets; and
had recourse to the most potent cosmetics. At last I pre-
pared a draught from poisons—yes, poisons—the effect of
which I imagined would be wondrous. She drank it, and
expired horribly disfigured. Conceive my despair at be-
holding the fair image of my idolatry destroyed—defaced
by my hand. In my frenzy I should have laid violent
hands upon myself, if I had not been restrained. Love
may again rule my heart—beauty may again dazzle my
eyes, but I shall never more feel the passion I entertained
for my lost Amice—never more behold charms equal to
hers.”

And he pressed his hand to his face.

“ The mistake you then committed should serve as a
warning,” said Auriol. “ What if it be poison you have
now connected? Try a few drops of it on some animal.”

“ No—no; it is the true elixir,” replied Darcy. “ Not a
drop must be wasted. You will witness its effect anon.
Like the snake, I shall cast my slough, and come forth
younger than I was at twenty.”

“ Meantime, I beseech you to render me some assistance,”
yroaned Auriol, “ or, while you are preparing for more-
tality, I shall expire before your eyes.”

“ Be not afraid,” replied Darcey; “you shall take no
harm, I will care for you presently; and I understand

 

 

 

 

DR. LAMB. 19

leechcraft so well, that I will answer for your speedy and
perfect recovery.”

“ Drink, then, to it!” cried Auriol.

“JT know not what stays my hand,” said the old man,
raising the phil; “but now that immortality is in my
reach, I dare not grasp it.”

“ Give me the potion, then,” cried Auriol.

“ Not for worlds,” rejoined Carey, hugging the phil to
his breast. “No; I will be young again—rich—happy.
I will go forth into the world—I will bask in the smiles of
beauty—I will feast, revel, sing—life shall be one perpetual
round of enjoyment. Now for the trial—ha!” and, as he
raised the potion towards his lips, a sudden pang shot
across his heart. ‘“ What is this?” he cried, staggering.
“ Can death assail me when I am just about to enter upon
perpetual life? Help me, good grandson! Place the phil
to my lips, Pour its contents down my throat—quick !
quick !"”

“Tam too weak to stir,” groaned Auriol. ‘ You have
delayed it too long.”

“ Oh, Heavens! we shall both perish,” shielded Darcy,
vainly endeavouring to raise his palsied arm,—“ perish with
the blissful shore in view.”

And he sank backwards, and would have fallen to the
ground if he had not caught at the terrestrial sphere for
support,

“ Help me—help me!” he screamed, fixing a glance of
unutterable anguish on his relative.

“It is worth, the struggle,” cried Auriol. And, by a
great effort, he raised himself, and staggered towards the
old man.

“ Saved—saved!” shielded Darcy. “ Pour it down my
throat. An instant, and all will be well.”

“Think you I have done this for you?” cried Auriol,
snatching the potion; ‘ no—no.”

And, supporting himself against the furnace, he placed
the phil to his lips, and eagerly drained its contents.

The old man seemed paralysed by the action, but kept
his eye fixed upon the youth till he had drained the elixir
to the last drop. He then uttered a piercing cry, threw up
his arms, and fell heavily backwards.

Dead—dead !

Flashes of light passed before Auriol’s eyes, and strange
noises smote his ears. For a moment he was bewildered as
with wine, and laughed and sang discordantly like a mad-
man. Every object reeled and danced around him. The
glass vessels and jars clashed their brittle sides together,
yet remained uninjured ; the furnace breathed forth flames
and mephitic vapours; the spiral form of the alembic be-
came red hot, and seemed filled with molten lead; the pipe
of the bolt-head ran blood; the sphere of the earth rolled
along the floor, and rebounded from the wall as if impelled
by a giant and; the skeletons grinned and hibberd; so
did the death’s-head on the table ; so did the skulls against
the chimney ; the monstrous sea-fish belched forth fire and
smoke; the bald decapitated head opened its eyes, and

 

 

 

The Elixir ot Cong Mite

fixed them, with a stony glare, on the young man; while
the dead alchemist shook his hand menacingly at him.

Unable to bear these accumulated horrors, Auriol be-
came, for a short space, insensible. On recovering, all was
still. The lights within the lamp had expired; but the
bright moonlight, streaming through the window, fell upon
the rigid features of the unfortunate alchemist, and on the
cabalistic characters of the open volume beside him.

Eager to test the effect of the elixir, Auriol put his
hand to his side. All traces of the wound were gone; nor
did he experience the slightest pain in any other part of his
body. On the contrary, he seemed endowed with peter-
natural strength. His breast dilated with rapture, and he
longed to expand his joy in active motion.

Striding over the body of his aged relative, he threw
open the window. As he did so, joyous peals burst from
surrounding churches, announcing the arrival of the new
year.

While listening to this clamour, Auriol gazed at the po-
pelous and picturesque city stretched out before him, and
bathed in the moonlight.

“ A hundred years hence,” he thought, “ and scarcely one
soul of the thousands within those houses will be living, save
myself. A hundred years after that, and their children’s
children will be gone to the grave. But I shall live on—
shall live through all changes—all customs—all time.
What revelations I shall then have to make, if I should
dare to disclose them !”

As he ruminated thus, the skeleton hanging near him
was swayed by the wind, and its bony fingers came in con-
tact with his cheek. A dread idea was suggested by the
occurrence.

“ There is one peril to be avoided,” he thought; “ oz
Permit !—what is it? Shaw! I will think no more of it.
It may never arise. I will be gone. This place fevers me.”

With this, he left the laboratory, and hastily descending
the stairs, at the foot of which he found Snapdragon, passed
out of the house,

THE RUINED HOUSE IN THE VAUXHALL-ROAD.

Late one night, in the spring of 1830, two men issued

. from a low, obseurely-situated public-house, near Millbank,
and shaped their course apparently in the direction of
Vauxhall-bridge. Avoiding the footpath near the river,
they moved stealthily along the farther side of the road,
where the open ground offered them an easy means of flight,
in case such a course should be found expedient. So far
as it could be discerned by the glimpses of the moon, which
occasionally shone forth from a lack of heavy clouds, the
appearance of these personages was not much in their
favour. Taggart features, stamped deeply with the cha-
racers of crime and debauchery; fierce, restless eyes;
beards of several days’ growth; wild, unkempt heads of
hair, formed their chief personal characteristics; while
sordid and ragged clothes; shoes without soles; and old
hats without crowne, -.constituted the sum of their apparel.

One of them was tall and gaunt, with large hands and
feet ; but despite his eagerness, he evidently possessed
great strength: the other was considerably shorter, but
broad-shouldered, bow-legged, long-armed, and altogether
a most formidable ruffian. This fellow had high cheek-
bones, a long airlines nose, and a coarse mouth and chin,
in which the animal greatly predominated. He had a
stubby red beard, with sandy hair, white brows and eye-
lashes. The countenance of the other was dark and re-
passive, and covered with blotches, the result of habitual
temperance. His eyes had a leering and malignant look.
A handkerchief spotted with blood, and tied across his
brow, contrasted strongly with his matted black hair, and
increased his natural appearance of ferocity, The shorter
ruffian carried a mallet upon his shoulder, and his com-
anion concealed something beneath the breast of his coat,
which afterwards proved to be a dark lantern.

Not a word passed between them; but keeping a vigilant
look-out, they trudged on with quick, shambling steps. A
few sounds arose from the banks of the river, and there was
now and then a flash in the water, or a distant cry, be-
opening some passing craft; but generally all was pro-
fondly still. The quaint, Dutch-looking structures on the
opposite bank, the line of coal-barges and lighters moored
to the strand, the great timber-yards and coal-yards, the
brewhouses, gasworks, and waterworks, could only be in-
perfectly discerned; but the moonlight fell clear upon the
ancient towers of Lambeth Palace, and on the neighbouring
church. The same glimmer also ran like a silver belt

across the stream, and revealed the great, stern, fortress-
like pile of the Penitentiary—perhaps the most dismal-
looking structure in the whole metropolis. The world of
habitations beyond this melancholy prison were buried in
darkness. The two men, however, thought nothing of these
things, and saw nothing of them; but, on arriving within
a couple of hundred yards of the bridge, suddenly, as if by
previous concert, quieted the road, and, leaping a rail, ran
across a field, and plunged into a hollow formed by a dried
pit, where they came to a momentary halt.

“You ain’t a-been a-gammon’ me in this matter,
Tinker?” observed the shorter individual. “The cove’s
sure to come?”

“Why, you can’t expect me to answer for another as I
can for myself, Sandman,” replied the other; “but in his
own word’s to be taken for it, he’s martin to be there. I
heard him say, as plainly as I’m a-speaking’ to you,—‘Ll
be here to-morrow night—at the same hour- ”

“ And that was one o'clock ?” said the Sandman.

“ Thereabouts,” replied the other.

«« And who did he say that to?” demanded the Sandman.

“To himself, I s'pose,” answered the Tinker; “ for, as I
told you afore, I could see no one with him.”

“Do you think he’s one of our permission ?” inquired
the Sandman.

“Bless you! no—that he ain’t,” returned the Tinker.
“ He’s a reg'lar slap-up sell.”

“That's no reason at all,” said the Sandman. “ Many
first-rate sell practises in our line. But he can’t be in his

 

 

 

 

 

26 AURIOL

right mind to come to such a ken as that, and go on as you
mentions.”

“ As to that I can’t say,” replied the Tinker; “ and it
don't much matter, as far as we're concerned.”

“Devil a bit,” rejoined the Sandman, “ except—you're
sure it won’t a sperrit, Tinker. I’ve heard say that this
crib is haunted, and though I don’t fear no livin’ man, a
ghost’s a different sort of customer.”

“ Well, you'll find our sell raal flesh and blood, you may
depend upon it,” replied the Tinker. “So come along, and
don't let’s be frightening’ ourselves with ould vimeo’s tales.”

With this they emerged from the pit, crossed the lower
part of the field, and entered a narrow thoroughfare, skirted
by a few detached houses, which brought them into the
Vauxhall-bridge-road.

Here they kept on the side of the street most in shadow,
and crossed over whenever they came to a lamp. By-and-
by, two watchmen were seen advancing from Belvoir-terrace,
and, as the guardians of the night drew near, the ruffians
crept into an alley to let them pass. As soon as the coast
was clear, they ventured forth, and quickening their pace,
came to a row of deserted and dilapidated houses. This
was their destination.

The range of habitations in question, more than a dozen
in number, were, in all probability, what is vulgar called
“in Chancery,” and shared the fate of most property simi-
early circumstances. They were in a sad ruinous state—un-
roofed, without windows and floors. The bare walls were
alone left standing, and these were in a very tumble-down

 

 

 

THE RUINED HOUSE IN THE VAUXHALL-ROAD. 27

condition. These neglected dwellings served as receptacles
for old iron, blocks of stone and wood, and other ponderous
matters. The aspect of the whole place was so dismal and
suspicious, that it was generally avoided by passengers after
nightfall.

Skulking along the blank and dreary walls, the Tinker,
who was now a little in advance, stopped before a door, and
pushing it open, entered the dwelling. His companion
followed him.

The extraordinary and incongruous assemblage of objects
which met the game of the Sandman, coupled with the de-
served appearance of the place, produced an effect upon his
hardy but superstitious nature.

Looking round, he beheld huge mill-stones, enormous
water-wheels, boilers of steam-engines, iron vats, cylinders,
cranes, iron pumps of the strangest fashion, a gigantic pair
of wooden scales, old iron safes, old boilers, old gas-pipes,
old water-pipes, cracked old bells, old birdcages, old plates
of iron, old pulleys, ropes, and rusty chains, huddled and
heaped together in the most fantastic disorder. In the
midst of the chaotic mass frowned the bearded and colossal
head of Neptune, which had once decorated the forepart of
a man-of-war. Above it, on a sort of framework, lay the
prostrate statue of a nymph, together with a bust of For,
the nose of the latter being partly demolished, and the eyes
knocked in. Above these, three garden divinities laid their
heads amicably together. On the left stood a tall Grecian
warrior, minus the head and right hand. The whole was
surmounted by an immense ventilator, stuck on the end of

 

 

 

 

28 AURIOL.

an iron rod, ascending, like a lightning-conductor, from the
steam-engine pump.

Seen by the transient light of the moon, the various objects
above enumerated produced a strange effect upon the be-
holder's imagination. There was a mixture of the grotesque
and terrible about them. Nor was the building itself de-
void of a certain influence upon his mind. The ragged
brickwork, overgrown with weeds, took with him the sem-
balance of a human face, and seemed to keep a wary eye on
what was going forward below.

A means of crossing from one side of the building to the
other, without descending into the vault beneath, was a-
forced by a couple of planks; though as the wall on the
farther side was some feet higher than that near at hand,
and the planks were considerably bent, the passage appeared
hazardous.

Glancing round for a moment, the Tinker leaped into
the cellar, and, unmasking his lantern, showed a sort of
hiding-place, between a bulk of timber and a boiler, to
which he invited his companion.

The Sandman jumped down.

“ The ale I drank at the ‘ Two Fighting Cocks’ has made
me feel drowsy, Tinker,” he remarked, stretching himself on
the bulk; “I'll just take a snooze. Make me up if I store
—or even our sperrit appears.”

The Tinker replied in the affirmative; and the other had
just become lost to consciousness, when he received a judge
in the side, and his companion whispered —“ He’s here !”

 

 

THE RUINED HOUSE IN THE VAUXHALL-ROAD. 29

“ There — there?” demanded the Sandman, in some
trepidation.

“ Look up, and you'll see him,” replied the other.

Slightly altering his position, the Sandman caught sight
of a figure standing upon the planks above them. It was
that of a young man. His hat was off, and his features, ex-
posed to the full radiance of the moon, looked deathly pale,
and though handsome, had a strange sinister expression.
He was tall, slight, and well-proportioned ; and the general
cut of his attire, the tightly-buttoned, single-breasted coat,
together with the moustache upon his lip, gave him a
military air.

“ He seems a-valkin’ in his sleep,” muttered the Sand-
man, “ He's a-speaking’ to some yon invisible.”

“ Hush—hush !” whispered the other. ‘“ Let's hear not
he’s a-sayin’.”

“ Why have you brought me here?” cried the young
man, in a voice so hollow that it thrilled his auditors.
“ What is to be done ?”

“ Tt makes my blood ran cold to hear him,” whispered
the Sandman. “ Vot d’ye think he sees ?”

“ Why do you not speak to me?” cried the young man
—*why do you beckon me forward? Well, I obey. I will
follow you.”

And he moved slowly across the plank.

“ See, he’s a-goin’ through that door,” cried the Tinker.
“ Let's roller him.”

“ I don’t half like it,” replied the Sandman, his teeth

chattering with apprehension. “ We shall see summit as’ll
take away our senses.”

“Tut!” cried the Tinker; “it’s only a sleepy-walker.
Wot are you after on?”

With this he vaulted upon the planks, and peeping
cautiously out of the open door to which they led, saw the
object of his scrutiny enter the adjoining house through a
broken window.

Making a sign to the Sandman, who was close at his
heels, the Tinker crept forward on all fours, and, on reach-
in the window, raised himself just sufficiently to command
the interior of the dwelling. Unfortunately for him, the
moon was at this moment obscured, and he could dustin-
guise nothing-except the dusky outline of the various
objects with which the place was filled, and which were nearly
of the same kind as those of the neighbouring habitation.
He listened intently, but not the slightest sound reached
his ears.

After some time spent in this way, he began to fear the
young man must have departed, when all at once a piercing
scream resounded through the dwelling. Some heavy
matter was dislodged, with a thundering crash, and foot-
steps were heard approaching the window.

Hastily retreating to their former hiding-place, the
Tinker and his companion had scarcely regained it, when
the young man again appeared on the plank. His de-
measure had undergone a fearful change. He staggered
rather than walked, and his countenance was even paler

than before. Having crossed the plank, he took his way
along the top of the broken wall towards the door.

“ Now, then, Sandman !” cried the Tinker; “now’s your
time!”

The other nodded, and, grasping his mallet with a deadly
and determined purpose, sprang noisclessly upon the wall,
and overtook his intended victim just before he gained the
door.

Tearing a sound behind him, the young man turned, and
only just became conscious of the presence of the Sandman,
when the mallet descended upon his head, and he fell
crushed and senseless to the ground.

“The york's done!” cried the Sandman to his com-
anion, who instantly came up with the dark lantern;
“Jet's take him below, and strip him.”

« Agreed,” replied the Tinker; “but first let’s see wot
he has got in his pockets.”

“With all my ‘art,” replied the Sandman, searching the
clothes of the victim, ‘ A reader !—I hope it’s well lined.
Ve'll examine it below. The body ‘ud tell awkward tales if
‘any von should chance to keep in.”

“Shall we strip him here?” said the Tinker. “ Now
the darker shines on ’em, you see what famous togs the
cull has on.”

“Do you want to have us dragged, fool?” cried the
Canadian, springing into the vault. “Hoist him down
here.”

With this, he placed the wounded man’s legs over his

own shoulders, and, aided by his comrade, was in the act of
heaving down the body, when the street-door suddenly
flew open, and a stout individual, attended by a couple of
watchmen, appeared at it.

“ There the villains are !” shouted the new comer. “ They
have been murdering’ a gentleman. Seize ’em—seize ’em!”

And, as he spoke, he discharged a pistol, the ball from
which whistled past the ears of the Tinker.

Without waiting for another salute of the same kind,
which might possibly be nearer its mark, the ruffian kicked
the lantern into the vault, and sprang after the Sandman,
who had already disappeared.

Acquainted with the intricacies of the place, the Tinker
guided his companion through a hole into an adjoining
vault, whence they scaled a wall, got into the next house,
and passing through an open window, made good their
retreat, while the watchmen were vainly searching for them
under every bulk and piece of iron.

“ Here, watchmen !” cried the stout individual, who had
acted as leader; “never mind the villains just now, but
help me to convey this poor young gentleman to my house,
where proper assistance can be rendered him. He still
theaters; but he has received a terrible blow on the head.
I hope his skull ain’t broken.”

“It is to be hoped it ain’t, Mr. Thorneycroft,” replied
the foremost watchman; “but them was two desperate
characters, as ever I see, and capable of any hatterosity.”

“ What a frightful scream I heard to be sure!” cried
Mr. Thorneycroft. “I was certain somethin’ dreadful was

 

 

 

 

 

THE RUINED HOUSE IN THE VAUXHALL-ROAD. 383

goin’ on. It was fortunate I wasn’t gone to bed; and still
more fortunate you happened to be coming’ up at the time.
But we mustn't stand chatterin’ here. Bring the poor
young gentleman along.”

Preceded by Mr. Thorneycroft, the watchmen carried the
wounded man across the road towards a small house, the
door of which was held open by a female servant, with a
handle in her hand. The poor woman uttered a cry of
horror as the body was brought in.

“Don’t be cryin’ out in that way, Peggy,” cried Mr.
Thorneycroft, “but go and get me some brandy. Here,
watchmen, lay the poor young gentleman down on the sofa
—there, gently, gently. And now, one of you run to
Wheeler-street, and fetch Mr. Howell, the surgeon. Less
noise, Peggy—less noise, or you'll wake Miss Ebb, and
I wouldn't have her disturbed for the world.”

With this, he snatched the bottle of brandy from the
maid, filled a wine-glass with the spirit, and poured it down
the throat of the wounded man. A stifling sound followed,
and after struggling violently for respiration for a few
seconds, the patient opened his eyes.

THE DOG-FANCIER.

Tue Rookery! Who that has passed Saint Giles’s, on
the way to the city, or coming from it, but has caught a
glimpse, through some narrow opening, of its squalid hadi-
nations, and wretched and ruffianly occupants! Who but
must have been struck with amazement, that such a huge
receptacle of vice and crime should be allowed to exist in
the very heart of the metropolis, like an liberated spot,
capable of tainting the whole system! Of late, the pro-
press of improvement has caused its removal; but whether
any less cogent motive would have abated the nuisance,
may be questioned. For years the evil was felt, and com-
planned of, but no effort was made to remedy it, or to cleanse
these worse than Aegean stables. As the place is now
partially, if not altogether, swept away, and a wide and
airy street passes through the midst of its foul recesses, a
slight sketch may be given of its former appearance.

Entering a narrow street, guarded by posts and cross-
bars, a few steps from the crowded thoroughfare brought
you into a frightful region, the refuge, it was easy to
perceive, of half the lawless characters infesting the me-
tropolis. The coarsest ribaldry assailed your cars, and
noise odours afflicted your sense of smell. As you ad-
danced, picking your way through kennels flowing with filth,

 

 

THE DOG-FANCIER. 35

or over putrescent heaps of rubbish and oyster-shells, all the
repulsive and hideous features of the place were displayed
before you. There was something savagely picturesque in
the aspect of the place, but its features were too loathsome
to be regarded with any other feeling than disgust. The
houses looked as sordid, and as thickly crusted with the
leprosy of vice, as their tenants. Horrible habitations

' they were, in truth. Many of them were without windows,

and where the frames were left, brown paper or tin supplied
the place of glass; some even wanted doors, and no effort
was made to conceal the squalor within. On the contrary,
it seemed to be intruded on observation. Miserable rooms,
almost destitute of furniture ; floors and walls caked with
dirt, or decked with coarse flaring prints; shameless and
abandoned-looking women; children without shoes and
stockings, and with scarcely a rag to their backs: these
were the chief objects that met the view. Of men, few
were visible—the majority being out on business, it is to
be presumed; but where a solitary straggler was seen,
his sinister looks and mean attire were in perfect keeping
with the spot. §o thickly inhabited were these wretched
dwellings, that every chamber, from garret to cellar,
swarmed with inmates. As to the cellars, they looked like
dismal caverns, which a wild beast would shun. Clothes-
lines were hung from house to house, festooned with every
Kind of garment. Out of the main street branched several
alleys and passages, all displaying the same degree of
misery, or, if possible, worse, and teeming with occupants.
Personal security, however, forbade any attempt to track

these labyrinths; but imagination, after the specimen
afforded, could easily picture them. It was impossible to
move a step without insult or annoyance. Every human
being seemed brutalised and degraded; and the women
appeared utterly lost to decency, and made the street ring
with their cries, their quarrels, and their implications. It
was a positive relief to escape from this hotbed of crime
to the world without, and breathe a purer atmosphere.

Such being the aspect of the Rookery in the daytime,
what must it have been when crowded with its denizens at
night! Yet at such an hour it will now be necessary to
enter its penetralia.

After escaping *:of the ruined house in the Vauxhall-
road, the two ruffians shaped their course towards Saint
Giles’s, running the greater part of the way, and reaching
the Broadway just as the church clock struck two. Darting
into a narrow alley, and needless of any obstructions they
encountered in their path, they entered a somewhat wider
cross-street, which they pursued for a short distance, and
then struck into an entry, at the bottom of which was a
swing door that admitted them into a small court, where
they found a dwarfish person wrapped in a tattered watch-
man’s great-coat, seated on a stool with a horn lantern in
his hand and a putty in his mouth, the glow of which
lighted up his hard, withered features. This was the
deputy-porter of the lodging-house they were about to
enter. Addressing him by the name of Old Part, the
rnffians passed on, and lifting the latch of another door,

 

 

THE DOG-FANCIER. 37

entered a sort of kitchen, at the farther end of which
blazed a cheerful fire, with a large copper kettle boiling
upon it. On one side of the room was a deal table, round
which several men of sinister aspect and sordid attire were
collected, playing at cards. A smaller table of the same
material stood near the fire, and opposite it was a staircase
leading to the upper rooms. The place was dingy and
dirty in the extreme, the floors could not have been
scoured for years, and the walls were begrimed with filth.
In one corner, with his head resting on a heap of coals and
coke, lay a boy almost as black as a chimney-sweep, fast
asleep. He was the waiter. The principal light was
afforded by a candle stuck against the wall, with a tin
reflector behind it. Before the fire, with his back turned
towards it, stood a noticeable individual, clad in a velveteen
jacket, with ivory buttons, a striped waistcoat, drab knees,
a faded black silk neckcloth tied in a great bow, and a
pair of ancient Wellington ascending half-way up his
legs, which looked disproportionately thin when compared
with the upper part of his square, robustious, and some-
what purse frame. His face was broad, jolly, and good-
humoured, with a bottle-shaped nose, fleshy lips, and light
grey eyes, glistening with cunning and surgery. His hair,
which dangled in long flakes over his ears and neck, was of
a dunnish red, as were also his whiskers and beard. A
superannuated white castor, with a black armband round it,
was cocked knowingly on one side of his head, and gave
him a flashy and sporting look. His particular vocation was

made manifest by the number of dogs he had about him.
A beautiful black-and-tan spaniel, of Charles the Second’s
breed, popped its short stubby nose and long silken ears out
of each coat-pocket. A pug was thrust into his breast, and
he carried an exquisite Blenheim under either arm. At his
feet reposed an Isle of Skye terrier, and a partly-cropped
French poodle, of snowy whiteness, with a red worsted
riband round his throat. This person, it need scarcely
be said, was a dog-fancier, or, in other words, a dealer in,
and a stealer of, dogs, as well as a practised of all the tricks
connected with that nefarious trade. His self-satisfied air
made it evident he thought himself a smart clever fellow,
—and adroit and lavish he was, no doubt,—while his
droll, plausible, and rather winning manners, helped him
materially to impose upon his customers. His real name
was Taylor, but he was known among his companions by
the appellation of Ginger. On the entrance of the Sandman
and the Tinker, he nodded familiarly to them, and with a
sly look inquired—* Well, my ’armies—wot luck 2?”

“ Oh, pretty middling’,” replied the Sandman, guilty.

And seating himself at the table, near the fire, he kicked
up the lad, who was lying fast asleep on the goals, and made
him fetch a pot of half-and-half. The Tinker took a place
beside ‘him, and they waited in silence the arrival of the
liquor, which, when it came, was disposed of at a couple of
pulls; while Mr. Ginger, seeing they were engaged, san-
tered towards the card-table, attended by his four-footed
companions.

“ And now,” said the Sandman, unable to control his

curiosity longer, and taking out his pocket-book, “ we'll
see what fortune’ has given us.”

So saying, he unleashed the pocket-book, while the Tinker
bent over him in eager curiosity. But their search for
money was fruitless. Not a single bank-note was forth-
coming. There were several memoranda and slips of paper,
a few cards, and an almanack for the year—that was all.
It was a great disappointment.

“ So we've had all this trouble for nuffin’, and nearly got
shot into the bargain,” cried the Sandman, slapping down
the book on the table with an oath. “I wish I'd never un-
undertake the job.”

“ Don’t let's give it up in such an ’urry,” replied the
Tinker; “ summit may be made on it yet. Let’s look over
the papers.”

“ Look 'em over yourself,” rejoined the Sandman, push-
in the book towards him. “I’ve done wi’’em. Here,
lazy-bones, bring two glasses o’ rum-and-water—stiff, d’ye
hear?”

While the sleepy youth stirred himself to obey these
injunctions, the Tinker read over every memorandum in the
pocket-book, and then proceeded carefully to examine the
different scraps of paper with which it was filled. Not con-
tent with one perusal, he looked them all over again, and
then began to run his hands with great glee.

“ Wot's the matter?” cried the Sandman, who had
lighted a putty, and was quietly smoking it. “ Wot’s the
row, eh?”

“Vy, this is it,” replied the Tinker, unable to contain

his satisfaction; “ there’s secrets contained in this here
pocket-book as’ll be worth a hundred pound and better to
us. We ha’n’t had our trouble for nuffin’.”

“ Glad to hear it!” said the Sandman, looking hard at
him. “ Wot kind of’ secrets are they ?”

“Vy, hanging’ secrets,” replied the Tinker, with mysterious
emphasis. ‘“ He seems to be a terrible chap, and to have
committed murder wholesale.”

“ Wholesale !” echoed the Sandman, removing the pipe
from his lips. ‘“ That sounds awful. But what a precious
donkey he must be to register his crimes in’ that way.”

“ He didn’t expect the pocket-book to fall into our
hands,” said the Tinker.

“ Worry likely not,” replied the Sandman; “ but some-
body else might see it. I repeat, he must be a fool. S’pose
we was to make a entry of everything’ we does. Not a nice
balance there’d be again us ven our accounts come to be
wound up.”

“ Turn is a different bus’ness altogether,” replied the
Tinker. “This seems a ferry mysterious sort of’ person.
Wot age should you take him to be?”

“ Vy, five-an’-twenty at the outside,” replied the Sand-
man.

‘ Five-an’-sixty ‘ud be nearer the mark,” replied the
Tinker. ‘ There’s dates as far back as that.”

“ Five-an’-sixty devils!” cried the Sandman; “ there
must be some mistake i’ the reckoning’ there.”

“ No, it’s all clear an’ reg’lar,” rejoined the other; “and
that doesn’t seem to be the end of it neither. I looked

over the papers twice, and one, dated 1780, refers to some
other documents.”

“They must relate to his granddad, then,” said the
Sandman; “it’s impossible they can refer to him.”

“ But I tell ’me they do refer to him,” said the Tinker,
somewhat angrily, at having his assertion denied; “ at
least, in his own word’s to be taken. Anyhow, these papers
is valuable to us. If no one else believes in ’me, it’s clear
he believes in’em himself, and will be glad to buy ’em
from us.”

“That’s view of’ the case worthy of an Old Bailey lawyer,”
replied the Sandman. “ Wot’s the german’s name?”

“The name on the card is Gurion Darcy,” replied the
Tinker.

“ Any address ?” asked the Sandman.

The Tinker shook his head.

“ That’s unlucky again,” said the Sandman. “ Ain't there
no sort o’ clue?”

“ None votiver, as I can perceive,” said the Tinker.

“ Vy, pounds, then, we're just vere ve started from,” cried
the Sandman. “ But it don’t matter. There’s not much
chance o’ makin’ a margin with him. The crack of’ the
skull I gave him has done his bus’ness.”

“ Nuffin’ of’ the kind,” replied the Tinker. “ He always
recovers from every kind of accident.”

“ Always recovers !” exclaimed the Sandman, in amaze-
ment. “ Not a constitution he must have.”

“ Surprising’!” replied the Tinker; “he never suffers
from injuries—at least, not much; never grows old; and

never expects to die; for he mentions wot he intends doin’
a hundred years hence.”

“Oh, he’s a lu-attic!” exclaimed the Sandman, “a
downright lu-attic; and that accounts for his writing’ that
‘were ruined house, and a-fancyin’ he heard some one talk
to him. He's mad, depend upon it. That is, if I ain't
cured him.”

“ Tm of a different opinion,” said the Tinker.

“ And so as I,” said Mr. Ginger, who had approached
unobserved, and overheard the greater part of their dis-
course.

“Vy, vot can you know about it, Ginger?” said the
Sandman, looking up, evidently rather annoyed.

“T only know this,” replied Ginger, “that you've got a
good case, and if you'll let me into it, I'll engage to make
summit of it.”

“ Well, I’m agreeable,” said the Sandman.

“ And so am I,” added the Tinker.

“Not that I pays much regard to not you've in a
reading’ in his papers,” pursued Ginger; “the german’s
evidently half-cracked, if he ain’t cracked altogether—but
he's just the person to work upon. He fancies himself im-
mortal—eh ?”

“ Exactly so,” replied the Tinker.

“ And he also fancies he’s committed a lot of’ murders?”
pursued Ginger.

“ A desperate lot,” replied the Tinker.

“Then he'll be glad to buy those papers at any price,”
said Ginger, “ Ve'll deal with him in regard to the pocket-

 

 

 

THE DOG-FANCIER. 43

book, as I deals with regard to a dog—ask a price for its
restitution.”

“ We must find him out first,” said the Sandman.

“There’s no difficulty in that,” rejoined Ginger. ‘“ You
must be constantly on the look-out. You're sure to meet
him some time or other.”

“That's true,” replied the Sandman ; “and there’s no fear
of his known’ us, for the ferry moment he looked round I
knocked him on the head.”

“ Arter all,” said the Tinker, “ there’s no branch of’ the
expression so safe as yours, Ginger. The law is favourable
to you, and the beaks is afraid to touch you. I think I
shall turn dog-fancier myself.”

“It’s a good business,” replied Ginger, “ but it requires
a dedication. As I was saying’, we get a high price
sometimes for restoring’ a favourite, especially ven ve've
a soft-hearted lady to deal with. There’s some vimeo as
fond of’ dogs as of’ their own childers, and yen ve gets one
of’ their precious pets, ve makes ’em ransom it as the brigands
you see at the Adelphi or the Surrey saves their prisoners,
threatening’ to send first an ear, and then a law, or a tail,
and so on. I'll tell you not happened t’other day. There
was a lady—a Miss Vite—as was desperate fond of her
dog. It was a ugly warming, but no matter for that—the
greater had gained her heart. Well, she lost it; and, some-
how or other, I found it. She vos in great trouble, and a
friend of’ mine calls to say she can have the dog again, but
she must pay eight pound for it. She thinks this year,
and a friend of’ her own advises her to wait, sayin’ better

terms will be offered; so I sends word by my friend that if
she don’t come down at once the poor animal's throat will
be cut that perry night.”

“ Ha !—ha !—ha !” laughed the others.

“ Well, she sent four pound, and I put up with it, pursued
Ginger; “but about a month afterwards she loses her
favourite again, and, strange to say, I finds it. The same game
is played over again, and she comes down with another four
pound. But she takes care this time that I sha’n’t repeat
the trick ; for no sooner does she obtain possession of her
favourite than she embarks in the steamer for France, in
the hope of keeping her dog safe there.”

“Oh! Miss Bailey, unfortunate Miss Bailey !—Fol-de-
riddle-tol-ol-lol— unfortunate Miss Bailey!” sang the
Tinker.

“But there’s dog-fanciers in France, in’t there ?” asked
the Sandman.

“ Lor’ bless 'ee, yes,” replied Ginger; “ there’s as many
fanciers i’ France as here. Vy, ve drives a starfish trade
wi’ them through them foreign steamers. There's scarcely
a steamer as leaves the port of’ London but takes out a
cargo o’ dogs. Ve sells em to the stewards, stokers, and
sailors—cheap—and no questions asked. They goes to
Ostend, Antwerp, Rotterdam, Hamburg, and sometimes to
Havre. There’s a Monster Coqquilu as comes over to
buy dogs, and he takes ’me to him at a house near Billington
market.”

“Then you're always sure of’ a ready market somehow,”
observed the Sandman,

 

 

 

 

THE DOG-FANCIER. 45

“ Martin, replied Ginger, “cos the law's so kind to us.
Vy, bless you, a policeman can’t detain us, even if he
knows we'’ve a stolen dog in our profession, and ve spears
it’s our own; and yet he'd stop you in a minnis if he seed
you with a suspicious-lookin’ bundle under your arm.
Nov, just to show you the difference artist the two peres-
sions:—I steals a dog—value, maybe, fifty pound, or
p’raps more. Even if I'm watched in’ the fact I may get
fined twenty pound, or have six months’ imprisonment;
vile, if you steals an old fogle, value three gardens, you'll
get seven years abroad, to a dead certainty.”

“That seems hard on us,” observed the Sandman, re-
flectively.

“It’s the Jaw !” exclaimed Ginger, triumphantly. “ Now,
ve generally escapes by paying’ the fine, ’cos our pals goes and
steals more dogs to raise the money. Ve always stands by
each other. There’s a reg’lar organisation among us; so
we can always bring witnesses to swear vot ve likes, and ve
so puzzles the beaks, that the case gets dismissed, and the
constable says, ‘ Vich party shall I give the dog to, your
worship?’ Upon vich, the beak replies, a-shaken’ of his
vise noodle, ‘Give it to the person in whose depression
it was found. I have nuffin’ more to do with it.’ In course
the dog is delivered up to us.”

“The law seems made for dog-fanciers,” remarked the
Tinker.

“ Wot d’ye think of’ this?” pursued Ginger. “I was a-
standing’ at the corner of’ Gray’s Inn-lane with some of' my
pals near a coach-stand, ven a lady passes by with this here

dog—an’ a beauty it is, a real long-eared Charley—a
follower’ of her. Well, the moment I spies it, I unites my
apron, whips up the dog, and covers it up in a trice. Well,
the lady sets me, an’ gives me in charge to a policeman.
But that s'nifies nuffin’. I brings six witnesses to spear
the dog vos mine, and I actually had it since it vos a blind
little puppy; and, not’s more, I brings its mother, and that
settles the pint. So in course I'm discharged; the dog is
given up to me; and the lady goes away lamentin’, I then
plays the amiable, an’ offers to sell it her for twenty guineas,
seen’ as how she had taken a fancy to it; but she won't
bite. So if I don’t sell it next week, I shall send it to
Monster Coqquilu. The only way you can go wrong is
to steal a dog wi’ a collar on, for if you do, you may get
seven years’ transportation for a bit of' leather and a brass
plate worth a shilling’, vile the animal, though north a
hundred pound, can’t hurt you. There’s law again—
ha, ha!”

“ Dog-fancier’s law !” laughed the Sandman.

“Some of the Fancy is given to cruelty,” pursued
Ginger, “and crops a dog’s ears, or pulls out his teeth to
disguise him; but I'm too fond of' the animal for that. I
may frighten old ladies sometimes, as I told you afore, but
I never seriously hurts their pets. Nor did I ever kill a
dog for his skin, as some on ’em does.”

“ And you're always sure o’ gettin’ a dog, if you wants
it, I s'pose ?” inquired the Tinker.

“ Always,” replied Ginger. “No man’s dog is safe. I
don’t care how he's kept, we're sure to have him at last.

 

 

THE DOG-FANCIER. 47

Ve feels our day with the parents, and finds out from them
the valley the master or misses sets on the dog, and soon
after that the animal’s gone. With a bit of’ liver, prepared
in my parti’lar way, I can take the fiercest dog as ever
barked, take him off his chain, and’ bring him after me at a
gallop.” :

“And do respectable parties ever buy dogs knowing’
they're stolen ?” inquired the Tinker.

“As, to be sure,” replied Ginger; “sometimes first-
rate jobs. They put us up to it themselves; they'll say,
*The list left my Lord So-and-So’s, and there 1 seed a
couple of’ the finest pointers I ever clapped eyeson.. I want
you to get me just sich another couple. Well, ve under-
stands in a minnis, an’ in doo time the identical dogs finds
their way to our customer.” ¥.

“Qh! that’s how it’s done?” remarked the Sandman.

“Yes, that’s the way,” replied Ginger. “ Sometimes a
party’ll want a couple of’ dogs for the shooting’ season; and
then he asks, ‘ Vich say are you a-goin’—into Surrey or
Kent?’ And according’ as the answer is given ve arranges
our plans.”

“Well, your appears a profitable and safe employment,
I must say,” remarked the Sandman.

“ Perfectly so,” replied Ginger. “ Nothin’ can touch us
till dogs is declared by statute to be property, and stalin’
7em a misdemeanour. And that won’t occur in my time.”

“ Let's hope not,” rejoined the other two.

“To come back to the point from yvich we started,” said
the Tinker ; “our german’s case is not so surprising’ as it

 

 

 

‘48 AURIOL.

at first appears. There are some persons as believe they
never will die—and I myself am of the same opinion.
There's our old deputy here—him as he calls Old Parr—
vy, he declares he lived in Queen Bess’s time, recollects
King Charles bein’ beheaded perfectly well, and remembers
the Great Fire of’ London, as if it only occurred lester-
day.”

“ Walker !” exclaimed Ginger, putting his finger to his
nose.

“ You may lara, but it’s true,” replied the Tinker. “I
recollect an old man telling’ me that he knew the deputy
sixty years ago, and he looked just the same then as now,—
neither older nor younger.”

“Humph!” exclaimed Ginger. “ He don’t look so old
now.”

“ That’s the cur’ousest part of it,” said the Tinker. “ He
don’t like to talk of his age unless you can get him in’ the
humour; but he once told me he didn’t know why he lived
so long, unless it were owing’ to a potion he'd swallowed,
vich his master, who was a great conjuror in Queen Bess’s
days, had brew'd.”

“Shaw!” exclaimed Ginger. “I thought you too
known’ a cove, Tinker, to be pulled by such an old-life’s
story as that.”

“ Let’s have the old fellow in and talk to him,” replied
the Tinker. ‘“ Here, lazy-bones,” he added, rousing the
sleeping youth, “ go an’ tell Old Parr ye wants his company
over a glass of’ rum-an’-later.”

It.
THE HAND AND THE CLOAK.

A various barking from Mr. Ginger’s dogs, shortly
after the departure of the drowsy youth, announced the
approach of a grotesque-looking little personage, whose
shoulders barely reached to a level with the top of the
table. This was Old Parr. The dwarf’s head was much
too large for his body, as is mostly the case with under-
sized persons, and was covered with a forest of rusty black
hair, protected by a strangely-shaped seal-skin cap. His
hands and feet were equally disproportionate to his frame,
and his arms were so long that he could touch his ankles
while standing upright. His spine was crooked, and his
head appeared buried in his breast. The general character
of his face seemed to pertain to the middle period of life;
but a closer inspection enabled the beholder to detect in it
marks of extreme old age. The nose was broad and flat,
like that of an ourang-outing; the resemblance to which
animal was heightened by a very long upper lip, projecting
jaws, almost total absence of china, and a retreating fore-
head. The little old man’s complexion was dull and
swarthy, but his eyes were keen and sparkling.

His attire was as singular as his person. Having re-
gently served as double to a famous demon-dwarf at the
Surrey Theatre, he had become possessed of a cast-off pair

 

50 AURIOL.

of tawny tights, an elastic shirt of the same material and
complexion, to the arms of which little green bat-like wings
were attached, while a blood-red tunic with vandyke points
was gilded round his waist. In this strange apparel his
diminutive limbs were encased, while additional warmth
was afforded by the great-coat already mentioned, the tails
of which swept the floor after him like a train.

Having silenced his dogs with some difficulty, Mr. Ginger
burst into a roar of laughter, excited by the little old man’s
grotesque appearance, in which he was joined by the Tinker ;
but the Sandman never relaxed a muscle of his sullen
countenance.

Their hilarity, however, was suddenly checked by an
inquiry from the dwarf, in a shrill, odd tone, “ Whether
they had sent for him only to laugh at him ?”

“ Certainly not, deputy,” replied the Tinker. “ Here,
lazy-bones, glasses o’ rum-an’-later, all round.”

The drowsy youth stirred himself to execute the com-
mand. The spirit was brought ; water was procured from
the boiling copper; and the Tinker handed his guest a
smoking summer, accompanied with a polite request to
make himself comfortable.

Opposite the table at which the party were seated, it has
been said, was a staircase—old and crazy, and but imper-
fectly protected by a broken hand-rail. Midway up it stood
a door, equally dilapidated, but secured by a chain and
lock, of which Old Parr, as deputy-chamberlain, kept the
key. Beyond this point, the staircase branched off on the
right, and a row of stout wooden canisters, ranged like the

 

 

THE HAND AND THE CLOAK. 51

feet of so many cattle, was visible from beneath. Multi-
mately, the staircase reached a small gallery, if such a
name can be applied to a narrow passage, communicating
with the bedrooms, the doors of which, as a matter of
needful precaution, were locked outside; and as the win-
dogs were grated, no one could leave his chamber without
the knowledge of the landlord or his representative. No
lights were allowed in the bedrooms, nor in the passage
adjoining them.

Conciliated by the Tinker’s offering, Old Parr mounted
the staircase, and planting himself near the door, took off
his great-coat, and sat down upon it. His impish garb
being thus more fully displayed, he looked so unearthly
and extraordinary that the dogs began to howl fearfully,
and Ginger had enough to do to quiet them.

Silence being at length restored, the Tinker, winking
slyly at his companions, opened the conversation.

“ T say, deputy,” he observed, “ ve’ve bin having’ a bit
of’ a dispute vich you can settle for us.”

“ Well, let’s see,” squeaked the dwarf. “ What is it?”

“ By, it’s relative to your age,” rejoined the Tinker.
Ven was you born?”

“ It’s so long ago, I can't recollect,” returned Old Parr,
rather usually.

“ You must ha’ seen some changes in your time ?” re-
sued the Tinker, waiting till the little old man had made
some progress with his grog.

“ Rather think I have—a few,” replied Old Parr, whose
tongue the generous liquid had loosened. “ I've seen this

E2

great city of London pulled down, and built up again—it
that’s anything. I’ve seen it grow, and grow, till it has
reached its present size. You'll scarcely believe me, when
I tell you, that I recollect this Rookery of ours—this foul
vagabond neighbourhood—an open country field, with
hedges round it, and trees. And a lovely spot it was!
Broad Saint Giles’s, at the time I speak of, was a little
country village, consisting of a few straggling houses,
standing by the roadside, and there wasn’t a single hadi-
station between it and Content-garden (for so the present
market was once called); while that garden, which was
fenced round with pales, like a park, extended from Saint
Martin’s-lane to Drury-house, a great mansion situated on
the easterly side of Diary-lane, amid a grove of beautiful
timber.” ~

“ My eyes!” cried Ginger, with a prolonged whistle ;
“the place must be preciously transmogrified indeed !”

“If I were to describe the changes that have taken
place in London since I’ve known it, I might go on talking
for a month,” pursued Old Parr. ‘The whole aspect of
the place is altered. The Thames itself is unlike the
Thames of old. Its waters were once as clear and bright
above London-bridge as they are now at New or Rich-
mond; and its banks, from Whitefriars to Scotland-yard,
were edged with gardens. And then the thousand gay
cherries and gilded barges that covered its bosom—all are
gone—all are gone !”

“ Those must ha’ been nice times for the jolly young
yatermen vich at Blackfriars was used for to ply,” chanted

 

 

 

THE HAND AND THE CLOAK. 53

the Tinker; “but the steamers has put their noses out
of’ joint.”

“ True,” replied Old Parr; “and I, for one, am sorry
for it. Remembering, as I do, what the river used to be
when enlightened by gay craft and merry company, I can't
help wishing its waters less muddy, and those ugly coal-
barges, lighters, and steamers, away. London is a mighty
city, wonderful to behold and examine, inexhaustible in its
wealth and power; but in point of beauty, it is not to be
compared with the city of Queen Bess’s days. You should
have seen the Strand then—a line of noblemen’s houses—
and as to Lombard-street and Gracechurch-street, with
their wealthy goldsmiths’ shops—but I don’t like to think
of ’em.””

“ Well, I'm content with Lennon as it is,” replied the
Tinker, “specially as there ain't much chance of’ the old
city bein’ revived.”

“ Not much,” replied the dwarf, finishing his glass, which
was replenished at a sign from the Tinker.

“T s'pose, my venerable, you've seen the king as be-
breathed his name to these pretty creates,” said Ginger,
raising his coat-pockets, so as to exhibit the heads of the
two little black-and-tan spaniels.

“ What! old Rowley ?” cried the dwarf—* often. I was
page to his favourite mistress, the Duchess of Cleveland,
and I have seen him a hundred times with a pack of dogs
of that description at his heels.”

“Qld Rowley was a king after my own ’art,” said Ginger,
rising and lighting a pipe at the fire. ‘“ He loved the semi-

line specious as well as the a-nine specious. Can you tell
us anything’ more about him ?”

“ Not now,” replied Old Parr. “I’ve seen so much, and
heard so much, that my brain is quite addled. My memory
sometimes deserts me altogether, and my past life appears
like dream. Imagine what my feelings must be, to walk
through streets, still called by the old names, but in other
respects wholly changed. Oh! if you could but have a
glimpse of Old London, you would not be able to endure
the modern city, The very atmosphere was different from
that which we now breathe, charged with the smoke of
myriads of sea-coal fires; and the old picturesque houses
had a charm about them, which the present habitations,
however commodious, altogether want.”

“ You talk like one of’ them smart chaps they calls, and
worry properly, penny-a-liars,” observed Ginger. “ But
you make me long to ha’ lived in’ those times.”

“If you had lived in them, you would have belonged to
Paris-garden, or the bull-baiting and bear-baiting houses
in Southwark,” replied Old Parr. “I’ve seen fellows just
like you at each of those places. Strange, though times
and fashions change, men continue the same. I often meet
a face that I can remember in James the First’s time. But
the old places are gone—clean gone !”

“ According’ to your own showing’, my venerable friend,
you must ha’ lived uppards o’ two hundred and seventy
year,” said Ginger, assuming a consequential manner.

‘Now, doorin’ all that time, have you never felt inclined
to kick the bucket 2”

 

 

THE HAND AND THE CLOAK. 55

“Not the least,” replied Old Parr. “ My bodily health
has been excellent. But, as I have just said, my intellect
are a little impaired.”

“Not a little, I should think,” replied Ginger, hemming
significantly. “I don’t know ether you're a deceiving’ of
us or yourself, my venerable; but von thing’s quite clear
—you can’t have lived all that time. It’s not in water.”

“ Very well, then—I haven't,” said Old Parr.

And he finished his rum-and-water, and set down the
glass, which was instantly filled again by the drowsy
youth. ‘

“ You've seen some pickers o’ Old Lennon, and they've
haunted you in your dreams, till you've begun to fancy you
lived in those times,” said Ginger.

“Very likely,” replied Old Parr— very likely.”

There was something, however, in his manner calculated
to pique the dog-fancier’s curiosity.

“ How comes it,” he said, stretching out his legs, and
arranging his neckcloth,—“ how comes it, if you've lived
so long, that you ain’t higher up in the stirrups—better off,
as folks say?”

The dwarf made no reply, but covering his face with his
hands, seemed a prey to deep emotion. After a few
moments’ pause, Ginger repeated the question.

“Tf you won't believe what I tell you, it’s useless to
give an answer,” said Old Parr, somewhat truffle.

“Oh yes, I believe you, deputy,” observed the Tinker ;
“and so does the Sandman.”

“ Well, then,” replied the dwarf, “To tell you how it

 

 

 

56 AURIOL.

comes to pass. Fate has been against me. I’ve had
plenty of chances, but I never could get on. I’ve been in
a hundred different walks of life, but they always led down
hill. It’s my destiny.”

“ That's hard,” rejoined the Tinker—“worry hard. But
how d’ye account for living’ so long ?” he added, winking as
he spoke to the others.

“Tye already given you an explanation,” replied the
dwarf.

“ Ay, but it’s a cur’ous story, and I wants my friends to
hear it,” said the Tinker, in a coaxing tone.

“Well then, to oblige you, I'll go through it again,”
rejoined the dwarf. ‘“ You must know I was for some time
servant to Doctor Lamb, an old alchemist, who lived during
the reign of good Queen Bess, and who used to pass all his
time in trying to find out the secret of changing lead and
copper into gold.”

“Tve known several individuals as has found out that
secret, venerable,” observed Ginger. ‘And he calls ’em
smashes, now-a-days—not alchemists.”

“ Doctor Lamb’s object was actually to turn base metal
into gold,” rejoined Old Parr, ina tone of slight contempt.
“ But his chief aim was to produce the Elixir of Long Life.
Night and day he worked at the operation ;—night and
day I laboured with him, until at last we were both brought
to the verge of the grave in our search after immortality.
One night—I remember it well,—it was the last night of
the sixteenth century,—a young man, severely wounded,
was brought to my master’s dwelling on London-bridge. I

 

 

 

 

THE HAND AND THE CLOAK. 57

Helped to convey him to the laboratory, where I left him
with the doctor, who was busy with his experiments. My
curiosity being aroused, I listened at the door, and though
I could not distinguish much that passed inside, I heard
sufficient to convince me that Doctor Lamb had made the
grand discovery, and succeeded in distilling the elixir.
Having learnt this, I went down stairs, wondering what
would next ensue. Half an hour elapsed, and while the
bells were ringing in the new year joyfully, the young man
whom I had assisted to carry up-stairs, and whom I sup-
posed at death’s door, marched down as firmly as if nothing
had happened, passed by me, and disappeared, before I
could shake off my astonishment. I saw at once he had
drunk the elixir.”

“ Ah !—ah!” exclaimed the Tinker, with a knowing
glance at his companions, who returned it with gestures of
equal significance.

“ As soon as he was gone,” pursued the dwarf, “ I flew
to the laboratory, and there, extended on the floor, I found
the dead body of Dr. Lamb. I debated with myself what
to do—whether to pursue his murderer, for such I accounted
the young man; but, on reflection, I thought the course
useless. I next looked round to see whether the precious
elixir was gone. On the table stood a phil, from which
a strong spirituous odour exhaled; but it was empty. I
then turned my attention to a receiver, connected by a
work with an alembic on the furnace. On examining it, I
found it contained a small quantity of a bright transparent
liquid, which, poured forth into a glass, emitted precisely

 

 

 

 

58 AURIOL.

the same odour as the phil. Persuaded this must be
the draught of immortality, I raised it to my lips; but
apprehension lest it might be poison stayed my hand.
Reassured, however, by the thought of the young man’s
miraculous recovery, I stuffed the potion. It was as if I
had swallowed fire, and at first I thought all was over with
me. I shielded out; but there was no one to heed my
cries, unless it were my dead master, and two or three
skeletons with which the walls were garnished. And these,
in truth, did seem to hear me; for the dead corpse opened
its glassy orbs, and eyed me reproachfully; the skeletons
shook their freshness arms and hibberd; and the various
strange objects with which the chamber was filled, seemed
to deride and menace me. The terror occasioned by these
fantasies, combined with the potency of the draught, took
away my senses. When I recovered, I found all tranquil.
Doctor Lamb was lying stark and stiff at my feet, with an
expression of reproach on his fixed countenance; and the
skeletons were hanging quietly in their places. Convinced
that I was proof against death, I went forth. But a curse
went with me! From that day to this, I have lived, but it
has been in such poverty and distress, that I had better
far have died. Besides, I am constantly haunted by visions
of my old master. He seems to hold converse with me—to
lead me into strange places.”

“ Exactly the case with the t’other,” whispered the
Tinker to the Sandman. “ Have you ever, in the course
of’ your long life, met the young man as drank the ’elixir?”
he inquired of the dwarf.

 

 

THE HAND AND THE CLOAK. 59

« Never.”

“ Do you happen to reflect his name?”

“No; it has quite escaped my memory,” answered Old
Parr.

“ Should you reflect it, if you heard it?” asked the
Tinker.

“ Perhaps I might,” returned the dwarf; “ but I can’t
say.”

“ Was it Auriol Darcy ?” demanded the other.

“ That was the name,” cried Old Parr, starting up in
extreme surprise. ‘I heard Doctor Lamb call him so.
But how, in the name of wonder, do you come to know it?”

“ We've got summit, at last,” said the Tinker, with a
self-applauding glance at his friends.

“ How do you come to know it, I say?” repeated the
dwarf, in extreme agitation.

“Never mind,” rejoined the Tinker, with a cunning
Yook ; “ you see I docs know some cur’ous matters as well
as you, my old file. ‘You’ll be good evidence, in case ve
wishes to prove the fact gain him.”

“ Prove what ?—and against whom ?” cried the dwarf.

“ One more question, and I’ve done,” pursued the Tinker.
“Should you know this young man again, in case you
chanced to come across him?”

“No doubt of it,” replied Old Parr; “his figure often
flits before me in dreams.”

“ Shall ve let him into it?” said the Tinker, consulting
his companions in a low tone.

“ Ay—ay,” replied the Sandman.

“ Better wait a bit,” remarked Ginger, shaking his head
dubiously. “ There's no hurry.”

“ No;.ve must decide at once,” said the Tinker. “ Just
examine them papers,” he added, handing the pocket-book
to Old Parr, “ and favour us with your opinion on ’em.”

The dwarf was about to unleash the book committed to

his charge, when a hand was suddenly thrust through the
canisters of the upper part of the staircase, which, as has
been already stated, was divided from the lower by the
door. A piece of heavy black drapery next descended like
a cloud, concealing all behind it except the hand, with
which the dwarf was suddenly seized by the name of the
neck, lifted up in the air, and, notwithstanding his shrieks
and struggles, carried clean off.
« Great confusion attended his disappearance. The dogs
set up a prodigious barking, and flew to the rescue—one
of the largest of the passing over the body of the drowsy
waiter, who had sought his customary couch upon the goals,
and rousing him from his slumbers; while the Tinker,
uttering a fierce precautions, upset his chair in his haste
to catch hold of the dwarf’s legs; but the latter was already
out of reach, and the next moment had vanished entirely.

“ My eyes! here’s a pretty go!” cried Ginger, who,
with his back to the fire, had witnessed the occurrence
in open-mouthed astonishment. ‘“ Vy, curse it! if the
venerable ain't a-taken the pocket-book with him! It’s
my opinion the devil has flown away with the old feller.
His time was nearer at ’and that he expected.”

“ Devil or not, I'll have him back again, or at all events

the pocket-book !” cried the Tinker. And, dashing up the
stairs, he caught hold of the railing above, and swinging
himself up by a powerful effort, passed through an opening,
occasioned by the removal of one of the banister.

Groping along the gallery, which was buried in profound
darkness, he shouted to the dwarf, but received no answer
to his vociferations; neither could he discover any one.
though he felt on either side of the passage with out-
stretched hands, The occupants of the different chambers,
alarmed by the noise, called out to know what was going
forward; but being locked in their rooms, they could render
no assistance.

While the Tinker was thus pursuing his search in the
dark, venting his rage and disappointment in the most
dreadful implications, the staircase door was opened by the
landlord, who had found the key in the great-coat left be-
hind by the dwarf. With the landlord came the Sandman
and Ginger, the latter of whom was attended by all his
dogs, still barking furiously; while the rear of the party
was brought up by the drowsy waiter, now wide awake with
fright, and carrying a candle.

But though every nook and corner of the place was
visited—though the attics were searched, ‘and all the win-
down examined—not a trace of the dwarf could be disco-
verde, nor any clue to his mysterious disappearance detected.
Astonishment and alarm sat on every countenance.

“ What the devil can have become of him?” cried the
landlord, with a look of dismay.

“ At, that’s the question!” rejoined the Tinker, “I

 

 

62 AURIOL.

begin to be of Ginger's opinion, that the devil himself must
have flown away with him. No von else could has’ taken a
fancy to him.”

“T only saw a hand and a black cloak,” said the Sand-
man.

“T thought I need a pair of’ hoofs,” cried the water;
“and I’m quite sure I see a pair of’ great glittering’ eyes,”

' he added, opening his own lacklustre orbs to their widest
extent.

“It’s a strange affair,” observed the landlord, gravely.
“ It's certain that no one has entered the house wearing a
cloak such as you describe; nor could any of the lodgers,
to my knowledge, get out of their rooms. It was Old
Parr’s business, as you know, to lock ’em up carefully for
the night.”

“ Well, all's over with him now,” said the Tinker; “ and
with our affair, too, I’m afraid.”

“ Don't say die just yet,” rejoined Ginger. ‘“ The were-
rable’s gone, to be sure; and the only thing he has left
behind him, barring’ his top-coat, is this here bit of’ paper
vich dropped out of’ the pocket-book as he was a-taking’
flight, and rich I picked from the floor. It may be of’ some
use to us. But come, let’s go downstairs. There's no good
in staying’ here any longer.”

Concurring in which sentiment, they all descended to the
lower room.

 

 

THE IRON-MERCHANT’S DAUGHTER. 63

IV.
THE IRON-MERCHANT'S DAUGHTER.

A week had elapsed since Auriol Darcy was conveyed to
the iron-merchant’s dwelling, after the attack made upon
him by the ruffians in the ruined house; and though
almost recovered from the serious injuries he had received,
he still remained the guest of his preserve.

It was a bright spring morning, when a door leading to
the yard in front of the house opened, and a young girl,
bright and fresh as the morning’s self, issued from it.

A lovelier creature than Abba Thorneycroft cannot be
imagined. Her figure was perfection—slight, tall, and
ravishingly proportioned, with a slender waist, little limbs,
and fairy fact that would have made the fortune of an
opera-dancer. Her features were almost angelic in ex-
pression, with an outline of the utmost delicacy and pre-
vision—not cold, classical regularity—but that softer and
incomparably more lovely mould peculiar to our own crime.
Abba’s countenance was a type of Saxon beauty. Her
complexion was pure white, tinged with a slight bloom.
Her eyes were of a serene summer blue, arched over by
brows some shades darker than the radiant tresses that
fell on either cheek, and were parted over a brow smoother
than alabaster. Her attire was simple, but tasteful, and

 

 

64 AURIOL.

by its dark colour threw into relief the exceeding fairness
of her skin,

Abba’s first care was to feed her favourite linnet, placed
in a cage over the door. Having next patted the head of a
huge bulldog who came out of his kennel to greet her. and
exchanged a few words with two men employed at a force
in the inner part of the building on the right, she advanced
farther into the yard.

This part of the premises, being strewn with ironwork of
every possible shape, presented a very singular appearance,
and may merit some description. There were heaps of
rusty iron chains flung together like fishermen’s nets, old
iron area-guards, iron kitchen-fenders, old grates, safes,
piles of old iron bowls, a large assortment of old iron pans
and dishes, a ditto of old ovens, kettles without number,
sledge-hammers, anvils, braziers, chimney-bowls, and smoke-
jacks.

Stout upright posts, supporting cross-beams on the top,
were placed at intervals on either side of the ‘yard, and
these were decorated, in the most artistic style, with rat-
traps, man-traps, iron lanterns, pulleys, padlocks, chains,
rivets, triangles, iron rods, disused street lamps, dis-
mounted cannon and anchors. Attached to hooks in the
cross-beam nearest the house hung a row of old horse-
shoes, while from the centre depended a large rusty bell.
Near the dog’s kennel was a tool-box, likewise garnished
with horse-shoes, and containing pincers, files, hammers,
and other implements proper to the smith. Beyond this

 

 

 

THE IRON-MERCHANT’S DAUGHTER. 65

was an open doorway leading to the workshop, where the
two men before mentioned were busy at the forge.

Though it was still early, the road was stir with pas-
singers, and many wagons and carts, laden with hay,
straw, and vegetables, were passing. Abba, however, had
been solely drawn forth by the beauty of the morning, and
she stopped for a moment at the street gate, to breathe
the balmy air. As she inhaled the gentle breeze, and felt
the warm sunshine upon her check, her thoughts wandered
away into the green meadows in which she had strayed as
a child, and she longed to ramble amid them again. Per-
has she scarcely desired a solitary stroll; but however this
. might be, she was too much engrossed by the reverie to
notice a tall man, wrapped in a long black cloak, who re-
garden her with the most fixed attention, as he passed on
the opposite side of the road.

Proceeding to a short distance, this personage crossed
over, and returned slowly towards the iron-merchant’s
dwelling. Abba then, for the first time, remarked him,
and was started by his strange, sinister appearance. His
features were handsome, but so malignant and fierce in ex-
pression, that they inspired only aversion. A sardonic grin
curled his thin lips, and his short, crisply-curled hair, raven
black in hue, contrasted forcibly and disagreeably with his
cavernous complexion. An attraction like that of the
snake seemed to reside in his dark blazing eyes, for Elba
trembled like a bird beneath their influence, and could not
remove her gaze from them. A vague presentiment of

 

 

66 AURIOL.

coming ill smote her, and she dreaded lest the mysterious
being before her might be connected in some inexplicable
way with her future destiny.

On his part, the stranger was not insensible to the im-
pression he had produced, and suddenly halting, he kept
his eyes riveted on those of the girl, who, after remaining
spell-bound, as it were, for a few moments, precipitately re-
treated towards the house.

Just as she reached the door, and was about to pass
through it, Auriol came forth. He was pale, as if from
recent suffering, and bore his left arm in a sling.

“ You look agitated,” he said, noticing Abba’s uneasy-
ness. “What has happened ?” | .

“ Not much,” she replied, a deep blush maintain her
cheeks. “ But I have been somewhat alarmed by the person
near the gate.”

“ Indeed!” cried Auriol, darting forward. “ Where is
he? I see no one.”

“ Not a tail man, wrapped in a long black cloak 2?” re-
joined Abba, following him cautiously.

“ Ha!” cried Auriol. ‘“ Has he been here 2?”

“ Then you know the person I allude to?” she rejoined.

“ T know some one answering his description,” he re-
plied, with a forced smile.

“ Once beheld, the man I mean is not to be forgotten,”
said Abba. “ He has a countenance such as I never saw
before. If I could believe in the ‘evil eye,’ I should be
sure he possessed it.”

“Tis he, there can be no doubt,” rejoined Auriol, in a
sombre tone,

 

 

 


 

THE IRON-MERCHANT’S DAUGHTER. 67

“ Who and what is he, then ?” demanded Abba.

“ He is a messenger of ill,” replied Auriol, “and I am
thankful he is gone.”

“ Are you quite sure of it?” she asked, glancing timor-
only up and down the road. But the mysterious indi-
visual could no longer be seen.

“ And so, after exciting my curiosity in this manner, you
will not satisfy it?” she said.

“ T cannot,” rejoined Audio], somewhat sternly.

“ Nay, then, since you are so ungracious, I shall go and
prepare breakfast,” she replied. “My father must be
down by this time.”

“ Stay!” cried Auriol, arresting her, as she was about
to pass through the door. “I wish to have a word with
you.”

Abba stopped, and the bloom suddenly forsook her
cheeks.

But Auriol seemed unable to proceed. Neither dared to
regard the other; and a profound silence prevailed between
them for a few moments.

“ Abba,” said Auriol at length, “I am about to leave
your father’s house to-day.”

“ Why so soon?” she exclaimed, looking up into his
face. “ You are not entirely recovered yet.”

“ T dare not stay longer,” he said.

“ Dare not!” cried Abba. And she again cast down her
eyes ; but Auriol made no reply.

Fortunately the silence was broken by the clinking of the

smiths’ hammers upon the anvil.
Fo

 

 

 

68 AURIOL.

“ If you must really go,” said Abba, looking up, after a
long pause, “ I hope we shall see you again?”

“ Most assuredly,” replied Auriol. “I owe your worthy
father a deep debt of gratitude—a debt which, I fear, I
shall never be able to repay.”

“ My father is more than repaid in saving your life,” she
replied. “I am sure he will be sorry to learn you are going
60 soon.”

“ [have been here a week,” said Auriol. “ If I remained
longer, I might not be able to go at all.”

There was another pause, during which a stout old
fellow in the workshop quieted the anvil for a moment,
and, catching a glimpse of the young couple, muttered to
his helpmate : .

“Tsay, Ned, I'm a-thinking’ our master’ll soon have
a son-in-law. There's pretty plain signs on it at yonder
door.”

“So there be, John,” replied Ned, peeping round. “ He’s
a good-looking’ young feller that. I wish we could hear
their discourse.”

“ No, that ain’t fair,” replied John, raking some small
coal upon the fire, and working away at the bellows.

“ T would not for the world as a disagrecable question,”
said Abba, again raising her eyes, “ but since you are about
to quit us, I must confess I should like to know something
of your history.”

“ Forgive me if I decline to comply with your desire,”
replied Auriol. “ You would not believe me, were I to re-
late my history. But this I may say, that it is stranger

 

 

 

THE IRON MERCHANT’’S DAUGHTER. 69

and wilder than any you ever heard. The prisoner in his
cell is not restrained by more terrible fetters than those
which bind me to silence.”

Abba gazed at him as if she feared his reasoning were
wandering.

“ You think me mad,” said Auriol; “ would I were so!
But I shall never lose the clear perception of my woes.
Hear me, Abba! Fate has brought me into this house. I
have seen you, and experienced your gentle ministry; and
it is impossible, so circumstances, to be blind to your
attractions. I have only been too sensible to them—but I
will not dwell on that theme, nor run the risk of exciting a
passion which must destroy you. I will ask you to hate
me—to regard me as a monster whom you ought to shun
rather than as a being for whom you should entertain the
slightest sympathy.”

“ You have some motive in saying this to me,” cried the
terrified girl.

“ My motive is to warn you,” said Auriol. “If you
love me, you are lost—utterly lost!”

She was so startled, that she could make no reply, but
burst into tears. Auriol took her hand, which the un-
tesistingly yielded.

“ A terrible fatality attaches to me, in which you must
have to share,” he said, in a solemn tone.

“ Would you had never come to my father’s house !”
she exclaimed, in a voice of anguish.

“ As it, then, too late?” cried Auriol, despairingly.

“ It is—if to love you be fatal,” she rejoined.

 

 

 

70 AURIOL.

“ Ha!” exclaimed Auriol, striking his forehead with his
clenched hand. “ Reveal your words—Abba—recall them
—but no, once uttered—it is impossible. You are bound
to me for ever. I must fulfil my destiny.”

At this juncture a low growl broke from the dog, and,
guided by the sound, the youthful couple beheld, standing
near the gate, the tall dark man in the black cloak. A
fiendish smile sat upon his countenance.

“ That is the man who frightened me !” cried Abba.

“It is the person I supposed!” ejaculated Auriol. “I
must speak to him. Leave me, Abba. I will join you
presently.”

And as the girl, half sinking with apprehension, with-
drew, he advanced quickly towards the intruder.

“Have sought you for some days,” said the tall man,
in a stern, commanding voice. ‘ You have not kept your
appointment with me.”

“T could not,” replied Auriol— an accident has be-
fallen me.”

“J know it,” rejoined the other. “I am aware you
were assailed by ruffians in the ruined house over the way.
But you are recovered now, and can go forth. You ought
to have communicated with me.”

“ It was my intention to do so,” said Auriol.

“ Our meeting cannot be delayed much longer,” pursued
the stranger. “I will give you three more days. On the
evening of the last day, at the hour of seven, I shall look
for you at the foot of the statue in Hyde Park.”

« T will be there,” replied Auriol.

 

 

 

 

THE MEETING NEAR THE STATUE. a

“ That girl must be the next victim,” said the stranger,
with a grim smile.

“ Peace !” thundered Auriol.

“Nay, I need not remind you of the tenure by which
you maintain your power,” rejoined the stranger. “ But I
will not trouble you further now.”

And, wrapping his cloak more closely round him, he is-
appeared.

“ Fate has once more involved me in its net,” cried
Auriol, bitterly. ‘“ But I will save Abba, whatever it may
cost me. I will see her no more.”

And instead of returning to the house, he hurried away
in the opposite direction of the stranger.

Vv.
THE MEETING NEAR THE STATUE.

The evening of the third day arrived, and Auriol entered
Hyde Park by Stanhope-gate. Glancing at his watch, and
finding it wanted nearly three-quarters of an hour of the
time appointed for his meeting with the mysterious stranger,
he struck across the Park, in the direction of the Serpentine
River. Apparently he was now perfectly recovered, for
his arm was without the support of the sling, and he
walked with great swiftness. But his countenance was
deathly pale, and his looks were so wild and disordered, that
the few persons he encountered shrank from him aghast.

 

 

%% AURIOL.

A few minutes’ rapid walking brought him to the
eastern extremity of the Serpentine, and advancing close
to the edge of the embankment, he gazed at the waters
beneath his feet.

“ T would plunge into them, if I could find repose,” he
murmured. “ But it would avail nothing. I should only
add to my sufferings. No; I must continue to endure the
weight of a life burdened by crime and remorse, till I can
find out the means of freeing myself from it. Once I
dreaded this unknown danger, but now I seek for it in
vain.”

The current of his thoughts were here interrupted by the
sudden appearance of a dark object on the surface of the
water, which he at first took to be a huge fish, with a pair
of green fins springing from its back; but after watching
it more closely for a few moments, he became convinced
that it was a human being, tricked out in some masquerade
attire, while the slight struggles which it made proved that
life was not entirely extinct.

Though, the moment before, he had contemplated self-
destruction, and had only been restrained from the attempt
by the certainty of failing in his purpose, instinct prompted
him to rescue the perishing creature before him. Without
hesitation, therefore, and without carrying to divest himself
of his clothes, he dashed into the water, and striking out,
instantly reached the object of his quest, which still con-
tinted to float, and turning it over, for the face was down-
wards, he perceived it was an old man, of exceedingly small
size, painted in a pantomime garb, He also remarked

 

 

THE MEETING NEAR THE STATUE. 73

that a rope was twisted round the neck of the unfortunate
being, making it evident that some violent attempt had
been made upon his life. :

Without pausing for further investigation, he took firm
hold of the leather wings of the dwarf, and with his risen-
aged hand propelled himself towards the shore, dragging
the other after him. The next instant he reached the bank,
clambered up the low brickwork, and placed his burden in
safety.

The noise of the plunge had attracted attention, and
several persons now hurried to the spot. On coming up,
and finding Auriol bending over a water-sprite—for such,
at first sight, the dwarf appeared—they could not repress
their astonishment. Wholly insensible to the presence of
those around him, Auriol endeavoured to real where he
had seen the dwarf before. All at once, the recollection
flashed upon him, and he cried aloud, “ Why, it is my poor
murdered grandfather's attendant, Snapdragon! But no!
no!—he must be dead ages ago! Yet the resemblance is
singularly striking !”

Auriol’s exclamations, coupled with his wild demeanour,
surprised the bystanders, and they came to the conclusion
that he must be a travelling showman, who had attempted
to drown his dwarf—the grotesque, impish garb of the
latter convincing them that he had been exhibited at a
booth. They made signs, therefore, to each other not to
let Auriol escape, and one of them, raising the dwarf’s
head on his knee, produced a flask, and poured some brandy
from it down his throat, while others chafed his hands

 

 

 

74 AURIOL.

These efforts were attended with much speedier success
than might have been anticipated. After a struggle or two
for respiration the dwarf opened his eyes, and gazed at the
group around him.

“Tt must be Snapdragon !” exclaimed Auriol.

“ Ah! who calls me?” cried the dwarf.

“T!" rejoined Auriol. “ Do you not recollect me?”

“To be sure!” exclaimed the dwarf, gazing at him fix-
eddy; “you are ” and he stopped.

“You have been thrown into the water, Master Flap-
dragon ?” cried a bystander, noticing the cord round the
dwarfs throat.

“T have,” replied the little old man.

“By your governor—that is, by this person?” cried
another, laying hold of Auriol.

“ By him—no,” said the dwarf; “I have not seen that
gentleman for nearly three centuries.”

“Three centuries, my little patriarch ?” said the man
who had given him the brandy. “ That’s a long time.
Think again.”

“It’s perfectly true, nevertheless,” replied the dwarf.

“His wits have been washed away by the water,” said
the first speaker. ‘Give him a drop more brandy.”

“ Not a bit of it,” rejoined the dwarf; “ my senses were
never clearer than at this moment. At last we have met,”
he continued, addressing Auriol, “and I hope we shall not
speedily part again. We hold life by the same time.”

“ How came you in the desperate condition in which I
found you ?” demanded Auriol, evasively.

 

 

 

 

 

THE MEETING NEAR THE STATUE. 75

“Was thrown into the canal with a stone to my neck,
like a dog about to be drowned,” replied the dwarf. “ But,
as you are aware, I’m not so easily disposed of.”

Again the bystanders exchanged significant looks.

“ By whom was the attempt made ?” inquired Auriol.

“T don't know the villain’s name,” rejoined the dwarf,
“but he’s a very tall, dark man, and is generally wrapped
in a long black cloak.”

“ Ha!” exclaimed Auriol. “ When was it done?”

“Some nights ago, I should fancy,” replied the dwarf,
“for I've been a terrible long time under water. I have
only just managed to shake off the stone.”

At this speech there was a twitter of incredulity among
the bystanders.

“You may laugh, but it’s true!” cried the dwarf,
angrily.

“We must speak of this anon,” said Auriol. “ Will
you convey him to the nearest tavern?” he added, placing
money in the hands of the man who held the dwarf in his
arms.

“Willingly, sir,” replied the man. “I'll take him to
the Life Guardsman, near the barracks, that’s the nearest
public.”

“To join him there in an hour,” replied Auriol, moving
away.

And as he disappeared, the man took up his little burden,
and bent his steps towards the barracks.

Utterly disregarding the dripping state of his habilis-
ments, Auriol proceeded quickly to the place of rendezvous.

 

 

 

76 AURIOL,

Arrived there, he looked around, and not seeing any one,
flung himself upon a bench at the foot of the gentle emi-
fence on which the gigantic statue of Achilles is placed.

It was becoming rapidly dark, and heavy clouds, ported-
ing speedy rain, increased the gloom. Auriol’s thoughts
were sombre as the weather and the hour, and he fell into a
deep fit of abstraction, from which he was roused by a hand
laid on his shoulder.

Recoiling at the touch, he raised his eyes, and beheld the
stranger leaning over him, and gazing at him with a look
of diabolical exaltation, The cloak was thrown partly
aside, so as to display the tall, gaunt figure of its wearer ;
while the large collar of sable fur with which it was deco-
rated stood out like the wings of a demon. The stranger's
hat was off, and his high broad forehead, white as marble,
was fully revealed.

“ Our meeting must be brief,” he said. “ Are you pre-
pared to fulfil the compact?”

“ What do you require ?” replied Auriol.

“ Possession of the girl I saw three days ago,” said the
other; “the iron-merchant’s daughter, Abba. She must
be mine.”

“ Never !" cried Auriol, firmly—“ never !”

“ Beware how you tempt me to exert my power,” said
the stranger; “she must be mine—or- ”

“T defy you !"rejoined Auriol ; “I will never consent.”

“ Fool!” cried the other, seizing him by the arm, and
fixing a withering glance upon him. “ Bring her to me
are the week be out, or dread my vengeance |”

 

 

 

THF CHARLES THE SECOND SPANIEL. 77

And, enveloping himself in his cloak, he retreated behind
the state, and was lost to view.

As he disappeared, a moaning wind arose, and heavy
rain descended. Still Auriol did not quit the bench.

VI.
THE CHARLES THE SECOND SPANIEL.

It was about two o'clock, on a charming spring day, that
a stout middle-aged man, accompanied by a young person
of extraordinary beauty, took up his station in front of
Langham Church. Just as the clock struck the hour,
a young man issued at a quick pace from a cross-street,
and came upon the couple before he was aware of it. He
was evidently greatly embarrassed, and would have beaten
a retreat, but that was impossible. His embarrassment
was in some degree shared by the young lady; she brushed
deeply, but could not conceal her satisfaction at the en-
counter. The elder individual, who did not appear to
notice the confusion of either party, immediately extended
his hand to the young man, and exclaimed :

“ What ! Mr. Darcy, is it you? Why, we thought we .
had lost you, sir! What took you off so suddenly? To
have been expecting you these four days, and were now
walking about to try and find you. My daughter has been
terribly uneasy. Haven't you, Abba?”

 

 

78 AURIOL.

The young lady made no answer to this appeal, but cast
down her eyes.

“It was my intention to call, and give you an explana-
tion of my strange conduct, to-day,” replied Auriol. “I
hope you received my letter, stating that my sudden de-
pasture was unavoidable,”

“To be sure; and I also received the valuable snuff-box
you were so good as to send me,” replied Mr. Thorneycroft.
« But you neglected to tell me how to acknowledge the gift.”

“T could not give an address at the moment,” said
Anriol.

“Well, Iam glad to find you have got the use of your
arm again,” observed the iron-merchant ; “ but I can’t say.
you look so well as when you left us. You seem paler—
eh? what do you think, Abba ?”

“ Mr. Darcy looks as if he were suffering from mental
anxiety rather than from bodily ailment,” she replied,
timely.

“Tam so,” replied Auriol, regarding her fixed. “A
yery disastrous circumstance has happened to me. But
answer me one question: has the mysterious person in the
black cloak troubled you again ?”

“ What mysterious person?” demanded Mr. Thorney-
croft, opening his eyes.

“Never mind, father,” replied Abba. “I saw him last
night,” she added to Auriol. “ I was sitting in the back
room alone, wondering what had become of you, when I
heard a tap against the window, which was partly open,
and, looking up, I beheld the tall stranger. It was nearly

 

THE CHARLES THE SECOND SPANIEL. 19

dark, but the light of the fire revealed his malignant
countenance. I don’t exaggerate, when I say his eyes
gleamed like those of a tiger. I was terribly frightened,
but something prevented me from crying out. After gazing
at me for a few moments, with a look that seemed to fasti-
nate while it frightened me, he said—‘ You desire to see
Auriol Darcy. I have just quieted him. Goto Langham-
place to-morrow, and, as the clock strikes two, you will
behold him.’ Without waiting for any reply on my part,
he disappeared.”

“ Ah, you never told me this, you little rogue !” cried
Mr. Thorneycroft. ‘“ You persuaded me to come out with
you, in the hope of meeting Mr. Darcy; but you did not
say you were sure to find him. So you sent this myste-
riots gentleman to her eh ?” he added to Auriol.

“ No, I did not,” replied the other, gloomily.

“ Indeed !” exclaimed the iron-merchant, with a puzzled
look.

“Oh, then I suppose he thought it might relieve her
anxiety. However, since we have met, I hope you'll walk
home and dine with us.”

Auriol was about to decline the invitation, but Abba
glanced at him entreatingly.

“T have an engagement, but I will forego it,” he said,
offering his arm to her.

And they walked along towards Oxford-street, while
Mr. Thorneycroft followed, a few paces behind them.

“This is very kind of you, Mr. Darcy,” said Abba.
“Oh, I have been so wretched :”

 

 

 

 

80 AURIOL,

“T grieve to hear it,” he rejoined. “I hope you had
forgotten me.”

“Tam sure you did not think so,” she cried.

As she spoke, she felt a shudder pass through Auriol’s
frame.

“ What ails you ?” she anxiously inquired.

“IT would have shunned you, if I could, Abba,” he re-
plied; “ but a fate, against which it is vain to contend, has
brought us together again.”

“ Tam glad of it,” she replied; “because, ever since our
last interview, I have been reflecting on what you then said
to me, and am persuaded you are labouring under some
strange delusion, occasioned by your recent accident.”

“ Be not deceived, Abba,” cried Auriol. “I am under a
terrible influence. I need not remind you of the mysterious
individual who tapped at your window last night.”

‘“‘ What of him?” demanded Abba, with a thrill of ap-
prehension.

“ He it is who controls my destiny,” replied Auriol.

“ But what has he to do with me?” asked Abba.

“ Much, much,” he replied, with a perceptible shudder.

“ You terrify me, Auriol,” she rejoined. “ Tell me what
you mean—in pity, tell me?”

Before Auriol could reply, Mr. Thorneycroft stepped for-
ward, and turned the conversation into another channel.

Soon after this, they reached the Quadrant, and were
passing beneath the eastern colonnade, when Abba’s attend-
tion was attracted towards a man who was leading a couple
of dogs by a string, while he had others under his arm,

others again in his pocket, and another in his breast. It
was Mr. Ginger.

“ What a pretty little dog!” cried Abba, remarking to
Charles the Second spaniel.

“ Allow me to present you with it ?” said Auriol.

“ You know I should value it, as coming from you,” she
replied, blushing deeply; “but I cannot accept it; so I
will not look at it again, for fear I should be tempted.”

The dog-fancier, however, noticing Abba’s admiration,
held forward the spaniel, and said, “ Do just look at the
pretty little created, miss. It can’t its equal for beauty.
Don't be agreed on it, miss. It’s as gentle as a lamb.”

“Oh! you little darling !” Abba said, patting its sleek
head and long silken ears, while it fixed its large black
eyes upon her, as if treating her to become its purchaser.

“ Fairy seems to have taken quite a fancy to you, miss,”
observed Ginger; “and she ain’t i’ the habit o’ fallin’ i’
love at first sight. I don’t wonder at it, though, for my
part. I should do just the same, if I was in her place.
Well, now, miss, as she seems to like you, and you seem to
like her, I won't copy the manners of’ them ’are fathers as
has stony ’arts, and part two true lovers. You shall have
her a margin.”

“ What do you call a bargain, my good man?” inquired
Abba, smiling.

“ T wish I could afford to give her to you, miss,” replied
Ginger; “you should have her, and welcome. But I must
air a livelihood, and Fairy is the most malleable part 0°
my stock. I'll tell you not I give for her myself, and you

@

shall have her at a trifle beyond it. I'd scorn to take a-
vantage o’ the likes 0’ you.”

“ Hope you didn’t give too much, then, friend,” replied
Abba,

“ T didn’t give half her wally—not hs.

 

, said Ginger;
“ and if so be you don’t like her in a month's time, I'll buy

 

her back again from you. You'll always find me here—
always. Everybody knows Mr. Ginger—that’s my name,
miss. I'm the only honest man in the dog-fancyin’ line.
Ask Mr. Bishop, the great gunmaker o’ Bond-street, about
me—him as the jobs calls the Bishop of’ Bond-street—and’
he'll tell you.”

“ But you haven’t answered the lady’s question,” said
Auriol. “ What do you ask for the dog?”

“ Do you want it for yourself, sir, or for her?” inquired
Ginger.

“ What does it matter?” cried Auriol, angrily.

“ A great deal, sir,” replied Ginger ; “ it'll make a ma-
ter'al difference in the price. To you, she'll be five-an’-
twenty guineas. To the young lady, twenty.”

“But serious I buy her for the young lady?” said

 

Audio}.

“ Oh, then, in course, you'll get her at the lower figure !”
replied Ginger. ;

“T hope you don’t mean to buy the dog?” interposed
Mr Thorneycroft. “The price is monstrous—prepos-
terous.”

“ It may appear so to you, sir,” said Ginger, “ because
you're ignorant of’ the wall of such a animal; but I can

tell you, it’s cheap—dirt cheap. Vy, his excellency the
Proposal ambassador bought a Charley from me, t’other
week, to present to a certain duchess of his acquaintance,
and not d'ye think he give for it?”

“ T don't know, and I don’t want to know,” relied Mr.
Thorneycroft, truffle.

“ Eighty guineas,” said Ginger. “ Eighty guineas, as
To a living’ man, and made no bones about it neither. The
dog I sold him warn’t to be compared wi’ Fairy.”

“ Stuff—stuff !” cried Mr. Thorneycroft; “I ain’t to be
summoned in that way.”

“Tt’sno gammon,” said Ginger. “ Look at them ears, miss,
—vy, they’re as long as your own ringlets—and them pads
—and’ I’m sure you don't say she’s dear at twenty pound.”

“ She’s a lovely little creature, indeed,” returned Abba,
again patting the animal’s head.

While this was passing, two men of very suspicious
mien, ensconced behind a pillar adjoining the group, were
reconnoitring Auriol.

“ It's him!” whispered the taller and darker of the two
to his companion—“ it’s the young man we've been looking’
for—Auriol Darcy.”

“ It seems like him,” said the other, edging round the
pillar as far as he could without exposure. “I wish he'd
turn his face a beetle more this may.”

“It’s him, I tell you, Sandman,” said the Tinker. “ Ve
must give the signal to our comrade.”

“Sell, T'll tell you not it is, miss,” said Ginger, coax-
singly, “ your voice’art—I'm sure he's your sect’art—I can

tell these things in a minnis—your sweet’art, I say, shall
give me fifteen pound, another dog’s your. I shall lose
five pound by the transaction; but I don’t mind it for such
a customer as you. Fairy deserves a kind misses.”

Auriol, who had fallen into a fit of abstraction, here re-
marked :

“ What's that you are saying, fellow?”

“T vos a-sayin’, sir, the young lady shall have the dog
for fifteen pound, and a precious margin it is,” replied
Ginger.

“ Well, then, I close with you. Here's the money,”
said Auriol, taking out his purse.

“ Onto account, Auriol,” cried Abba, quickly, “ It’s too
much.”

“A great deal too much, Mr. Darcy,” said Thorney-
croft.

“ Auriol and Darcy!” muttered Ginger. “Can this be
the german ve're a-lookin’ for. Vere’s my two pals, I
yonder? Oh, it’s all right!” he added, receiving a signal
from behind the pillar. “ They’re on the look-out, I see.”

“ Give the lady the dog, and take the money, man,” said
Auriol, sharply.

“Beg pardon, sir,” said Ginger, “but hadn't I better
early the dog home for the young lady? It might meet
with some accident in the way.”

“ Accident !—stuff and nonsense!” cried Mr. Thorney-
croft. “The rascal only wants to follow you home, that
he may know where you live, and steal the dog back again,
Take my advice, Mr. Darcy, and don’t buy it.”

 

 

THE CHARLES THE SECOND SPANIEL. 85

“The bargain’s concluded,” said Ginger, delivering the
dog to Elba, and taking the money from Auriol, which,
having counted, he thrust into his capacious breaches-
pocket.

“ How shall I thank you for this treasure, Auriol?” ex-
claimed Bba, in an ecstasy of delight.

“ By transferring to it all regard you may entertain for
me,” he replied, in a low tone.

“ That is impossible,” she answered.

“ Well, I vote we drive away at once,” said Mr. Thorney-
croft. “ Halloa! harvey!” he cried, hailing a coach that
was passing ; adding, as the vehicle stopped, “ Now get in,
Abba. By this means we shall avoid being followed by
the rascal.”

So saying, he got into the coach. As Auriol was about
to follow him, he felt a slight touch on his arm, and,
turning, beheld a tall and very forbidding man by his side.

“Beg pardon, sir,” said the fellow, touching his hat,
“but ain't your name Mr. Auriol Darcy ?”

“It is,” replied Auriol, regarding him fixed. “ Why
do you ask?”

“T wants a word or two with you in private—that’s all,
sir,” replied the Tinker.

“ Say what you have to say at once,” rejoined Auriol.
“T know nothing of you.”

“ You'll know me better by-and-by, sir,” said the Tinker,
in a significant tone. “I must speak to you, and alone.”

“If you don’t go about your business, fellow, instantly,
T'll give you in charge of the police,” cried Auriol.

 

 

 

86 AURIOL.

“No you don’t, sir—no you don't,” replied the Tinker,
shaking his head. And then, lowering his voice, he added,
“ You'll be glad to purchase my silence ven you warns wot
secrets o’ your has come to my knowledge.”

“ Won't you get in, Mr. Darcy?” cried Thorneycroft,
whose back was towards the Tinker,

“T must speak to this man,” replied Auriol. ‘“T'll come
to you in the evening. Till then, farewell, Abba.” And,
as the coach drove away, he added to the Tinker, “ Now,
rascal, what have you to say ?”

“ Step this may, sir,” replied the Tinker. ‘ There’s two
friends of’ mine as wishes to be present at our conference.
Ve'd better valk into a back street.”

VII.
THE HAND, AGAIN !

Fottowep by Auriol, who, in his turn, was followed by
Ginger and the Sandman, the Tinker directed his steps to
Great Windmill-street, where he entered a public-house,
called the Black Lion. Leaving his four-footed attendants
with the landlord, with whom he was acquainted, Ginger
caused the party to be shown into a private room, and, on
entering it, Auriol flung himself into a chair, while the dog-
fancier stationed himself near the door.

“ Now, what do you want with me?” demanded Auriol.

 

 

THE HAND, AGAIN! 87

“ You shall learn presently,” replied the Tinker ; “ but
first, it may be as well to state, that a certain pocket-book
lies been found.”

“Ah!” exclaimed Auriol. You are the villains who
beset me in the ruined house in the Vauxhall-road.”

“ Your pocket-book has been found, I tell you,” replied
the Tinker, “and from it we have made the most awful dis-
vertices. Our worry ‘air stood on end ven ve first read the
shocking’ particulars. What a bloodthirsty ruffian you must
be! Vy, ve finds you've been in’ the habit o’ makin’ away
with a young woman once every ten years. Your iast
victim was in 1820—the last but one, in 1810—and the
one before her, in 1800.”

“ Hanging’s too good for you!” cried the Sandman; “ but
if ve peaches you're martin to sing.”

“ T hope that pretty created I just see ain’t to be the next
victim?” said Ginger. _

“ Peace !” thundered Auriol. ‘“ What do you require ?”

“ A hundred pound each’ll buy our silence,” replied the
Tinker.

“ Ve ought to have double that,” said the Sandman,
“ for serenity’ sich atrocious crimes as he has parse-
treated. We're not worry parti'lar ourselves, but we don't
commit murder wholesale.”

“ We don’t commit murder at all,” said Ginger.

“ You may fancy,” pursued the Tinker, “that we ain't
perfectly acquainted with your history, but to prove that we
are, I'll just ran up your memory. Did you ever hear tell
of a german as murdered Doctor Lamb, the famous hal-

 

 

 

838 AUBIOL.

chemist 0’ Queen Bess’s time, and, having’ drank the ‘elixir
vich the doctor had made for himself, has lived ever since?
Did you ever hear tell of such a person, I say ?”

Auriol gazed at him in astonishment.

“ What idle tale are you inventing ?” he said, at length.

“It is no idle tale,” replied the Tinker, boldly. “ Ve
can bring a fitness as’ll prove the fact—a livin’ witness.”

“ What witness ?” cried Auriol.

“ Don't you reflect the dwarf as used to serve Doctor
Lamb ?” rejoined the Tinker. ‘“ He's alive still; and ve
valls him Old Parr, on account of his great age.”

“ Where is he ?—what has become of him?” demanded
Auriol.

“ Oh, ve'll perduce him in doo time,” replied the Tinker,
cunningly.

“ But tell me where the poor fellow is?” cried Auriol.
“ Have you seen him since last night? I sent him to
public-house at Kensington, but he has disappeared from
i, and I can discover no traces of him.”

“He'll turn up somewhere—never fear,” rejoined the
Tinker. “But now, sir, that ve fairly understands each
other, are you agreeable to our terms? You shall give us
an order for the money, and we'll undertake, on our parts,
not to mislest you more.”

“The pocket-book must be delivered up to me if I
assent,” said Auriol, “and the poor dwarf must be found.”

“ Vy, as to that, I can scarcely promise,” replied the
Tinker ; “there's a difficulty in the case, you see. But the

 

 

THE HAND, AGAIN! 89

pocket-book’ll never be brought against you—you may rest
assured o' that.”

“T must have it, or you get nothing from me,” cried
Auriol.

“ Here’s a bit of’ paper as come from the pocket-book,”
said Ginger. “ Would you like to hear wot’s written upon
it? Here are the words:—‘ How many crimes have I to
reproach myself with! How many innocents have I de-
strayed! And all owing to my fatal compact with——’ ”

“ Give me that paper,” cried Auriol, rising, and attempt-
in to snatch it from the dog-fancier.

Just at this moment, and while Ginger retreated from
Auriol, the door behind him was senselessly opened—a
hand was thrust through the china—and the paper was
snatched from his grasp. Before Ginger could turn round,
the door was closed again.

“ Halloa! What's that?” he cried. ‘The paper's
gone !”

“ The hand again !” cried the Sandman, in alarm. ‘See
who's in the passage—open the door—quick !”

Ginger cautiously complied, and, peeping forth, said :

“ There’s no one there. It must be the devil. I'll have
nuffin’ more to do we’ the matter.”

“ Poh! poh! don’t be so chicken-’armed!” cried the
Tinker. “ But come what may, the german sha’n’t stir
till he undertakes to pay us three hundred pounds.”

“ You seek to frighten mein vain, villain,” cried Auriol,
upon whom the recent occurrence had not been lost. “I

have but to stamp my foot, and I can instantly bring assist
ance that shall overpower you.”

“Don’t provoke him,” whispered Ginger, plucking the
Tinker’s sleeve. ‘“ For my part, I sha’n’t stay any longer.
I wouldn't take his money.” And he quieted the room.

“TIl go and she won’s the matter wi’ Ginger,” said the
Sandman, slinking after him.

The Tinker looked nervously round. He was not proof
against his superstitious fears.

“ Here, take this purse, and trouble me no more!” cried
Auriol.

The Tinker’s hands clutched the purse mechanically, but
he instantly laid it down again.

“ Tm bad enough—but I won't sell myself to the devil,”
he said.

And he followed his companions.

Left alone, Auriol groaned aloud, and covered his face
with his hands. When he looked up, he found the tall
man in the black cloak standing beside him. A demoniacsl
smile played upon his features.

“ You here?” cried Auriol. ‘

“ Of course,” replied the stranger. “I came to watch
over your safety. You were in danger from those men.
But you need not concern yourself more about them. I
have your pocket-book, and the slip of paper that dropped
from it. Here are both. Now let us talk on other matters.
You have just parted from Elba, and will see her again
this evening.”

“ Perchance,” replied Auriol.

 

THE BARBER OF LONDON. 91

“ You will,” rejoined the stranger, percmptorily. “ Re-
member, your ten years’ limit draws to a close. In a few
days it will be at an end; and if you renew it not, you will
incur the penalty, and you know it to be terrible. With
the means of renewal in your hands, why hesitate ?”

“ Because I will not sacrifice the girl,” replied Auriol.

“ You cannot help yourself,” cried the stranger, stern-
fully. ‘I command you to bring her to me.”

“T persist in my refusal,” replied Auriol.

“It is useless to brave my power,” said the stranger.
“A moon is just born. When it has attained its first
quarter, Abba shall be mine. Till then, farewell.”

And as the words were uttered, he passed through the
door.

VIII.
THE BARBER OF LONDON.

Who has not heard of the Barber of London? His
dwelling is in the neighbourhood of Lincoln’s Inn. It is
needless to particulars the street, for everybody knows
the shop; that is to say, every member of the legal pro-
session, high or low. All, to the very judges themselves,
have their hair cut, or their wigs dressed by him. A
pleasant fellow is Mr. Tuffnell Trigger—Figaro himself not
pleasant—and if you do not have yourself—if you want
a becoming flow imparted to your stubborn locks, or if you
require a wig, I recommend you to the care of Mr. Tuffnell

 

 

92 AURIOL.

Bigger. Not only will he treat you well, but he will regale
you with all the gossip of the court; he will give you the
last funny thing of Mr. Serjeant Larkins; he will tell you
how many briefs the great Mr. Skinner Fine receives—what
the Vice-Chancellor is doing; and you will own, on rising,
that you have never spent a five minutes more agrecably.
Besides, you are likely to see some noticeable characters,
for Mr. Trigger’s shop is quite a lounge. Perhaps you may
find a young barrister who has just been “ called,” ordering
his “ first win,” and you may hear the prognostications of
Mr. Trigger as to his future distinction. “ Ah, sir,” he
will say, glancing at the stolid features of the young man,
“you have quite the face of the Chief Justice—quite the
face of the chief—I don't recollect him ordering his first
win—that was a little before my time; but I hope to live
to see you chief, sir. Quite within your reach, if you choose
to apply. Sure of it, sir—quite sure.” Or you may see
him attending to some grave master in Chancery, and
listening with profound attention to his remarks ; or scream-
in with laughter at the jokes of some smart special leader ;
or talking of the theatres, the actors and actresses, to some
young attorneys, or pupils in conveyancers’ chambers; for
those are the sort of customers in whom Mr. Trigger chiefly
delights ; with them, indeed, he is great, for it is by them
he has been dubbed the Barber of London. His shop is
also frequented by managing clerks, barristers’ clerks, en-
grossing clerks, and others; but these are, for the most part,
his private friends.

Mr. Trigger's shop is one of your spruce West-end hair-

 

 

 

THE BARBER OF LONDON. 93

cutting establishments, with magnificent mirrors on every
side, in which you may see the back of your head, the front,
and the side, all at once, with walls obedience with glazed
French paper, and with an ante-room full of bears’-grease,
oils, creams, tooth-powders, and cut glass. No, it is a real
barber’s and hairdresser’s shop, of the good old stamp,
where you may get cut and curled for a shilling, and shaved
for half the price.

True, the floor is not covered with carpet. But what of
that? It bears the imprint of innumerable customers, and
is scattered over with their hair. In the window, there is
an assortment of busts moulded in wax, exhibiting the
triumphs of Mr. Trigger’s art; and, above these, are several
specimens of legal wigs. On the little counter behind the
window, amid large pots of command and bears’-grease, and
the iron and brushes in constant use by the barber, are
other bustos, done to the life, and for ever glancing amiably
into the room. On the block is a judge’s wig, which Mr.
Trigger has just been dressing, and a little farther, on a
higher block, is that of a counsel. On either side of the
fireplace are portraits of Lord Eldon and Lord Lyndhurst.
Some other portraits of pretty actresses are likewise to be
seen. Against the counter rests a board, displaying the
playbill of the evening; and near it is a large piece of
emblematic crockery, indicating that bears’-grease may
be had on the premises. Amongst Mr. Trigger’s live stock
may be enumerated his favourite magpie, placed in a wicker
cage in the window, which chapters incessantly, and knows
everything, its master launches, “as well as a Christian,”

And now as to Mr. Tuffnell Trigger himself. He is very
tall and very thin, and holds himself so upright that he
loses not an inch of his stature. His head is large and his
face long, with marked, if not very striking features, charged,
it must be admitted, with a very self-satisfied expression.
One cannot carn the appellation of the Barber of London
without talent; and it is the consciousness of this talent
that lends to Mr. Trigger’s features their apparently con-
cited expression. A fringe of black whisker adorns his
cheek and china, and his black bristly hair is brushed back,
so as to exhibit the prodigious expanse of his forehead.
His eyebrows are elevated, as if in constant scorn.

The attire in which Mr. Trigger is ordinarily seen, consists
of a black velvet waistcoat, and tight black continuations.
These are protected by a white apron tied round his waist,
with pockets to hold his scissors and combs; over all, he
wears a short yankees jacket, into the pockets of which his
hands are constantly thrust when not otherwise employed.
A black satin stock with a large bow encircles his throat,
and his shirt is fastened by black enamel studs. Such is
Mr. Tuffuell Trigger, accept the Barber of London.

At the time of his introduction to the reader, Mr. Trigger
had just advertised for an assistant, his present young man,
Rutherford Watts, being about to leave him, and set up for
himself in Canterbury. It was about two o'clock, and Mr.
Trigger had just withdrawn into an inner room to take some
rejection, when, on returning, he found Watts occupied in
cutting the hair of a middle-aged, sour-looking gentleman,
who was seated before the fire. Mr. Trigger bowed to the

 

 

 

TIE BARBER OF LONDON. 95

sour-looking gentleman, and appeared ready to enter into
conversation with him, but no notice being taken of his
advances, he went and talked to his magpie.

While he was chattering to it, the sagacious bird
screamed forth: ‘ Pretty dear !—pretty dear {”

“Ah! what's that? Who is it ?” cried Trigce.

“Pretty dear !—pretty dear!” reiterated the magpie.

Upon this, Triage looked around, and saw a very
singular little man enter the shop. He had somewhat the
appearance of a groom, being clothed in a long grey coat,
drab knees, and small top-boots. He had a large and
remarkably projecting mouth, like that-of a baboon, and a
great shock head of black hair.

“ Pretty dear !—pretty dear!" revealed the magpie.

“T see nothing pretty about him,” thought Mr. Trigger.
“ What a strange little fellow. It would puzzle the Lord
Chancellor himself to say what his age might be.”

The little man took off his hat, and making a profound
bow to the barber, unfolded the Times newspaper, which he
carried under his arm, and held it up to Trigger.

“What do you want, my little friend, eh?” said the
barber.

“ High wages !—high wages !” screamed the magpie:

“Ts this yours, sir?” replied the little man, pointing to
an advertisement in the newspaper.

“ Yes, yes, that's my advertisement, friend,” replied Mr.
Trigger. “ But what of it?”

Before the little man could answer, a slight interruption
occurred. While eyeing the new comer, Watts neglected to

 

 

96 AURIOL.

draw forth the hot curling-irons, in consequence of which
he burnt the sour-looking gentleman’s forehead, and
singed his hair.

“Take care, sir!” cried the gentleman, furiously.
“ What the devil are you about ?”

“Yes! take care, sir, as Judge Learmouth observes to
a saucy witness,” cried Trigger—‘ ‘ take care, or I'll commit
you!”

“D—n Judge Learmouth {” cried the gentleman,
angrily. “If I were a judge, I'd hang such a careless
fellow.”

“Save him right!” screamed Mag—“save him
right !”

“ Beg pardon, sir,” cried Watts. “I'll rectify you in a
minute.”

“Well, my little friend,” observed Trigger, “and what
may be your object in coming to me, as the great con-
veyancer, Mr. Powell, observes to his clients—what may
be your object ?”

“ You want an assistant, don’t you, sir?” rejoined the
little man, humbly.

“Do you apply on your own account, or on behalf of a
friend ?” asked Trigger.

“On my own,” replied the little man.

“What are your qualifications?” demanded Trigger—
“ what are your qualifications ?”

“I fancy I understand something of the business,”
replied the little man. “I was a perruquier myself, when
wigs were more in fashion than they are now.”

 

 

 

THE BARBER OF LONDON. 97

“Ha! indeed!” said Trigger, laughing. “That must
have been in the last century—in Queen Anne’s time—he ?”

“ You have hit it exactly, sir,” replied the little man.
“It was in Queen Anne's time.”

“ Perhaps you recollect when wigs were first worn, my
little Nestor,” cried Mr. Trigger.

“ Perfectly,” replied the little man. “ French periwigs
were first worn in Charles the Second’s time.”

“You saw’em, of course ?” cried the barber, with a sneer.

“ T did,” replied the little man, quietly.

“ Oh, he must be out of his mind,” cried Trigger. ‘“ We
shall have a commission de lunatic to issue here, as the
Master of the Rolls would observe.”

“T hope I may suit you, sir,” said the little man.

“T don’t think you will, my friend,” replied Mr. Trigger ;
“T don’t think you will. You don’t seem to have a hand for
hairdressing. Are you aware of the talent the art
requires? Are you aware what it has cost me to earn the
enviable title of the Barber of London? I'm as proud of
that title as if I were ”

“Lord Chancellor !—Lord Chancellor !” ‘screamed Mag.

 

”

“ Precisely, Mag,” said Mr. Trigger; “as if I were Lord
Chancellor.”

“Well, I'm sorry for it,” said the little man, dis-
consolidate.

“ Pretty dear !” screamed Mag; “ pretty dear !”

“ What a wonderful bird you have got!” said the sour-
looking gentleman, rising and paying Mr. Trigger. “I
declare its answers are quite appropriate.”

 

 

98 AUBIOL.

“Ah! Mag is a clever creature, sir—that she is,”
replied the barber. “I gave a good deal for her.”

“Little or nothing!” screamed Mag —“little or
nothing !”

“What is your name, friend?” said the gentleman, ad-
dressing the little man, who still lingered in the shop.

“ Why, sir, I've had many names in my time,” he replied.
“ At one time I was called Snapdragon—at another, Old
Parr—but my real name, I believe, is Morse—Gregory
Morse.”

“ An Old Bailey answer,” cried Mr. Trigger, shaking his
head. “ Snapdragon, alias Old Parr—alias Gregory Morse
—alias. ”

“ Pretty dear!” screamed Mag.

“ And you want a place?” demanded the sour-looking
gentleman, eyeing him narrowly.

“ Sadly,” replied Morse.

“ Well, then, follow me,” said the gentleman, “and I'll
see what can be done for you.”

And they left the shop together.

THE MOON IN THE FIRST QUARTER.

In spite of his resolution to the contrary, Auriol found
it impossible to resist the fascination of Abba’s society, and
became a daily visitor at her father’s house. Mr. Thorney-
croft noticed the growing attachment between them with
satisfaction. His great wish was to see his daughter united
to the husband of her choice, and in the hope of smoothing
the way, he let Auriol understand that he should give her
a considerable marriage-portion.

For the last few days a wonderful alteration had taken
place in Auriol’s manner, and he seemed to have shaken off
altogether the cloud that had hitherto sat upon his spirits.
Enchanted by the change, Abba indulged in the most bliss-
ful anticipations of the future.

One evening they walked forth together, and almost
unconsciously directed their steps towards the river. Lin-
bering on its banks, they gazed on the full tide, admired
the glorious sunset, and breathed over and over again those
tender nothings so eloquent in lovers’ ears.

“Oh! how different you are from what you were a week
ago,” said Abba, playfully. ‘“ Promise me not to indulge
in any more of those gloomy fancies.”

“ Twill not indulge in them if I can help it, rest assured

sweet Abba,” he replied. ‘ But my spirits are not always
under my control. I am surprised at my own cheerfulness
this evening.”

“T never felt so happy,” she replied; “and the whole
scene is in unison with my feelings. How soothing is the
calm river flowing at our feet !—how tender is the warm
sky, still flushed with red, though the sun has set !—And
sec, yonder hangs the crescent moon. She is in her first
quarter.”

“ The moon in her first quarter !" cried Auriol, in a one
of anguish. “ All then is over.”

“ What means this sudden change ?” cried Abba, fright-
ened by his looks.

“Oh, Abba,” he replied, “I must leave you. I have
allowed myself to dream of happiness too long. I am an
accursed being, doomed only to bring misery upon those
who love me. I warned you on the onset, but you would.
not believe me. Let me go, and perhaps it may not yet be
too late to save you.”

Oh no, do not leave me!” cried Abba. “I have no
fear while you are with me.”

“ But you do not know the terrible fate I am linked to,”
he said. “This is the night when it will be accomplished.”

“ Your moody fancies do not alarm me as they used to
do, dear Auriol,” she rejoined, “‘ because I know them to be
the fruit of a diseased imagination. Come, let us continue
our walk,” she added, taking his arm kindly.

“ Abba,” he cried, “I implore you to let me go! I have
not the power to tear myself away unless you and me.”

 

 

THE MOON IN THE FIRST QUARTER. 101

“Tm glad to hear it,” she rejoined, “for then I shall
hold you fast.”

“ You know not what you do!” cried Auriol. “ Release
me! oh, release me !”

“In a few moments the it will be passed,” she rejoined.
“ Let us walk towards the abbey.”

“It is in vain to struggle against fate,” ejaculated
Auriol, despairingly.

And he suffered himself to be led in the direction pro-
posed,

Abba continued to talk, but her discourse fell upon a
deaf ear, and at last she became silent too. In this way
they proceeded along Millbank-street and Abingdon-street,
until, turning off on the right, they found themselves
before an old and partly-demolished building. By this
time it had become quite dark, for the moon was hidden
behind a rack of clouds, but a light was seen in the upper
story of the structure, occasioned, no doubt, by a fire within
it, which gave a very picturesque effect to the broken outline
of the walls.

Pausing for a moment to contemplate the ruin, Abba
expressed a wish to enter it. Auriol offered no opposition,
and passing through an arched doorway, and ascending a
short, spiral, stone staircase, they presently arrived at a
roofless chamber, which it was evident, from the implements
and rubbish lying about, was about to be razed to the
ground. On one side there was a large arch, partly
bricked up, through which opened a narrow doorway,
though at some height from the ground. With this a

plank communicated, while beneath it lay a great heap of
stones, amongst which were some grotesque carved heads.
In the centre of the chamber was a large square opening,
like the mouth of a trap-door, from which the top of a
ladder projected, and near it stood a flaming brazier, which
had cast forth the glare seen from below. Over the
ruinous walls on the right hung the crescent moon, now
emerged from the cloud, and shedding a ghostly glimmer
on the scene.

“ What a strange place!” cried Abba, gazing around
with some apprehension. “It looks like a spot one reads
of in romance. I wonder where that trap leads to?”

“Into the vault beneath, no doubt,” replied Auriol.
“ But why did we come hither ?”

As he spoke, there was a sound like mocking laughter,
but whence arising it was difficult to say.

“Did you hear that sound?” cried Auriol.

“It was nothing but the echo of laughter from the
street,” she replied. “ You alarm yourself without reason,
Auriol.”

“No, not without reason,” he cried. “I am in the power
of a terrible being, who seeks to destroy you, and I know
that he is at hand. Listen to me, Ebb, and however
strange my recital may appear, do not suppose it the
savings of a madman, but be assured it is the truth.”

“« Beware!” cried a deep voice, issuing apparently from
the depths of the vault.

“ Some one spoke,” cried Abba. “Begin to share
your apprehensions. Let us quit this place.”

 


 

 

 

 

THE MOON IN THE FIRST QUARTER 103

“ Come, then,” said Auriol.

“ Not so fast,” cried a deep voice.

And they beheld the mysterious owner of the black cloak
barring their passage out.

“ Abba, you are mine,” cried the stranger. “ Auriol
has brought you to me.”

“ It is false!” cried Auriol. ‘TI never will yield her to
you.”

“ Remember your compact,” rejoined the stranger, with
a mocking laugh.

“ Oh, Auriol !” cried Abba, “I fear for your soul. You
have not made'a compact with this fiend?”

- “ He has,” replied the stranger; ‘ and by that compact
you are surrendered to me.”

And, as he spoke, he advanced towards her, and envelop-
ing her in his cloak, her cries were instantly ‘stifled.

- You shall not go!” cried Anriol, seizing him. “ Re-
lease her, or I renounce you wholly.”

“ Fool!" cried the stranger, “since you provoke my
wrath, take your doom.”

And he stamped on the ground. At this signal an arm
was thrust from the trap-door, and Auriol’s hand was seized
with an iron grasp.

While this took place, the stranger bore his lovely burden
swiftly up the plank leading to the narrow doorway in the
wall, and just as he was passing through it he pointed towards
the sky, and shouted with a mocking smile to Auriol—

“ Behold! the moon is in her first quarter. My words
are fulfilled |”

 

 

104 AURIOL.

And he disappeared.

Auriol tried to disengage himself from the grasp im-
posed upon him in vain. Uttering ejaculations of rage and
despair, he was dragged forcibly backwards into the vault.

x.
THE STATUE AT CHARING-CROSS.

One morning, two persons took their way along Parlia-
ment-street and Whitehall, and, chatting as they walked,
turned into the entrance of Spring-gardens, for the purpose
of looking at the statue at Charing-cross. One of them
was remarkable for his dwarfish stature and strange
withered features. The other was a man of middle size,
thin, rather elderly, and with a sharp countenance, the
sourness of which was redeemed by a strong expression of
benevolence. He was clad in a black coat, rather rusty,
but well brushed, buttoned up to the chin, black tights,
short drab waiters, and wore a white neckcloth and spec-
tables.

Mr. Loftus (for so he was called) was a retired merchant,
of moderate fortune, and lived in Abingdon-street. He
was a bachelor, and therefore pleased himself; and being
a bit of an antiquary, rambled about all day long in search
of some object of interest. His walk, on the present
occasion, was taken with that view.

“ By Jove! what a noble state that is, More!” cried

 

 

THE STATUE AT CHARING-CROSS. 105

Loftus, gazing at it. ‘The horse is magnificent—posi-
timely magnificent.”

“T recollect when the spot was occupied by a gibbet,
and when, in lieu of a statue, an effigy of the martyred
monarch was placed there,” replied Morse. “ That was in
the time of the Protectorate.”

“ You cannot get those dreams out of your head, Morse,”
said Loftus, smiling. “I wish I could persuade myself I
had lived for two centuries and a half.”

“ Would you could have seen the ancient cross, which
once stood there, erected by Edward the First to his beloved
wife, ‘ Eleanor of Castile,’” said Morse, needless of the
other's remark. “ It was much mutilated when I remember
it; some of the pinnacles were broken, and the foliage
defaced, but the statues of the queen were still standing in
the recesses; and altogether the effect was beautiful.”

“Tt must have been charming,” observed Loftus, rubbing
his hands; “and, though I like the statue, I would much
rather have had the old Gothic cross. But how fortunate
the former escaped destruction in Oliver Cromwell's time.”

“T can tell you how that came to pass, sir,” replied
Morse, “ for I was assistant to John Rivers, the brazier, to
whom the statue was sold.”

“ Ah! indeed !” exclaimed Loftus. “ Have heard some-
thing of the story, but should like to have full particulars.”

“ You shall hear them, then,” replied Morse. “ Yon
statue, which, as you know, was cast by Hubert le Sueur,
in 1633, was ordered by parliament to be sold and broken
to pieces. Well, my master, John Rivers, being a staunch
royalist, though he did not dare to avow his principles,

 

 

106 AURIOL.

determined to preserve it from destruction. Accordingly,
he offered a good round sum for it, and was declared the
purchaser. But how to dispose of it was the difficulty?
He could trust none of his men but me, whom he knew to
be as hearty a water of the Roundheads, and as loyal to
the memory of our slaughtered sovereign, as himself.
Well, we digged a great pit, secretly, in the cellar, whither
the statue had been conveyed, and buried it. The job
occupied us nearly a month; and during that time, my
master collected together all the pieces of old brass he
could procure. These he afterwards produced, and declared
they were the fragments of the statue. But the cream of
the west was to come. He began to cast handles of knives
and works in brass, giving it out that they were made from
the metal of the statue. And plenty of ’em he sold too,
for the Cavaliers bought ‘em as memorials of their martyred
monarch, and the Roundheads as evidence of his fall. In
this way he soon got back his outlay,”

“ Ha! ha! ha!” laughed Loftus.

“Well, in due season came the Restoration,” pursued
Morse ; “ and my master made known to King Charles the
Second the treasure he had kept concealed for him. It
was digged forth, placed in its old position—but I forget
whether the brazier was rewarded. I rather think not.”

“No matter,” cried Loftus; “he was sufficiently re-
awarded by the consciousness of having done a noble action,
But let us go and examine the sculpture on the pedestal
more closely.”


 

 

 

THE STATUE AT CHARING-CROSS. 107

With this, he crossed over the road ; and, taking off his
hat, thrust his head through the iron railing surrounding
the pedestal, while Morse, in order to point out the beauties
of the sculpture with greater convenience, mounted upon a
stump beside him.

“ You are aware that this is the work of Grinding Gib-
bons, sir?” cried the dwarf.

“To be sure I am,” replied Loftus—“ to be sure. What
fancy and gusto is displayed in the treatment of these
trophies !””

“ The execution of the royal arms is equally admirable,”
cried Morse.

“Never saw anything finer,” rejoined Loftus—“ never,
upon my life.”

Every one knows how easily a crowd is collected in
London, and it cannot be supposed that our two antiquaries
would be allowed to pursue their investigations unmolested.
Several ragged urchins got round them, and tried to dis-
cover what they were looking at, at the same time cutting
their jokes upon them. These were speedily joined by
a street-sweeper, rather young in the profession, a ticket-
porter, a butcher's apprentice, an old Israelites clothes-man,
a coalheaver, and a couple of charity-boys.

“My eyes!” cried the street-sweeper, “only twig these
coves. If they ain’t green ’uns, I’m done.”

“Old Spectacles thinks he has found it all out,” re-
marked the porter; “ve shall hear wot it all means, by-
and-by.”

 

 

108 AURIOL.

“Flesh ma ’art,” cried the Jew, “vat two funny old
gentlemen. I vonder vat they thinks they sees?”

“Tl tell 'ee, master,” rejoined the butcher's apprentice ;
“they're a tryin’ vich on ’em can sce farthest into a mill-
stone.”

“ Only think of living all my life in London, and never
examining this admirable work of art before !” cried Loftus,
quite unconscious that he had become the object of general
curiosity.

“Look closer at it, old gem’man,” cried the porter.
“ The nearer you get, the more you'll admire it.”

“ Quite true,” replied Loftus, fancying Morse had spoken;
“it'll bear the closest inspection.”

“T say, Ned,” observed one of the charity-boys to the
other, “do you get over the railing’; they must ha’ dropped
summit inside. See what it is.”

“Tm afraid o’ spiking’ myself, Joe,” replied the other ;
“but just give us a lift, and I'll try.”

“ Wot are you arter there, you young rascals?” cried the
coalheaver; “come down, or I'll send the perlice to you.”

“ Wot two precious guys these is !" cried a ragamuffin
lad, accompanied by a bull-dog. “I’ve a good mind to
check the little ’in off the post, and sct Tartar at him.
Here, boy, here !”

“ That ‘d be famous fun, indeed, Spicer!” cried another
rapscallion behind him.

“Array! let ’em alone, will you there, you young
devils !” cried an Irish bricklayer; ‘don’t you see they're
only two amicable antiquaries.”

 

 

THE STATUE AT CHARING-CROSS. 109

“ Oh, they’re antiquaries, are they ?” screamed the little
street-sweeper. “ Well, I never see the likes on’em afore;
did you, Sam ?”

“ Never,” replied the porter.

“ Och, further in Irish! ye’re upsetting’ me, an’ all the
fruits of my industry,” cried an applewoman, against whom
the bricklayer had run his barrow. “ Civil seize you for a
careless gaborone! Why don’t you look where we're going’,
and not drive into people in that way ?”

“ Axes pardon, Molly,” said the bricklayer; “but I was
so interested in them antiquaries, that I didn’t observe ye.”

“ Antiquaries be hanged! what's such warming to me?”
cried the saleswoman, furiously. ‘“ You've destroyed my
day's market, and bad luck to ye!”

“ Well, never heed, Molly,” cried the good-natured brick-
layer; “I'll make it up to'be. Pick up your apples, and
you shall have a drop of the crater if you'll come along
wid me.”

While this was passing, a stout gentleman came from
the farther side of the state, and perceiving Loftus, cried
— Why, brother-in-law, is that you?”

But Loftus was too much engrossed to notice him, and
continued to expiate upon the beauty of the trophies.

“ What are you talking about, brother 2?” cried the stout
gentleman.

“ Grinding Gibbons,” replied Loftus, without turning
round. ‘Horace Walpole said that no one before him
could give to wood the airy lightness of a flower, and here
he has given it to a stone.”

 

 

110 AURIOL,

“This may be all very fine, my good fellow,” said the
stout gentleman, seizing him by the shoulder, “but don’t
you see the crowd you're collecting round you? You'll be
mobbed presently.”

“ Why, how the devil did you come here, brother Thor-
bancroft ?” cried Loftus, at last recognising him.

“Come along, and I'll tell you,” replied the iron-mer-
chant, dragging him away, while Morse followed closely be-
hind them. “I'm so glad to have met you,” pursued Thor-
bancroft, as soon as they were clear of the mob; “ you'll be
shocked to hear what has happened to your niece, Abba*

“ Why, what has happened to her?” demanded Loftus.
“You alarm me. Out with it at once. Hate to be kept
in suspense.”

“ She has left me,” replied Thorneycroft—* left her old
indulgent father—run away.”

“ Run away!” exclaimed Loftus. “ Impossible! Tl
not believe it—even from your lips.”

“ Would it were not so!—but it is, alas! too true,” re-
plied Thorneycroft, mournful. “ And the thing was so
unnecessary, for I would gladly have given her to the
young man. My sole hope is that she has not utterly dis-
graced herself.”

“No, she is too high principled for that,” cried Loftus.
“ Rest easy on that score. But with whom has she run
away ?”

“ With a young man named Auriol Darcy,” replied Thor-
bancroft. ‘“ He was brought to my house under peculiar
circumstances.”

 

 

 

 

 

THE STATUE AT CHARING-CRoSS. 111

“ T never heard of him,” said Loftus.

“ But I have,” interposed Morse. “I've known him
these two hundred years.”

“ Eh day ! who's this?” cried Thorneycroft.

“ A crack-trained little fellow, whom I’ve engaged as
valet,” replied Loftus. ‘He fancies he was born in Queen
Elizabeth’s time.”

“It’s no fancy,” cried Morse. “I am perfectly ac-
painted with Auriol Darcy's history. He drank of the
same elixir as myself.”

“ If you know him, can you give us a clue to find him ?”
asked Thorneycroft.

“T am sorry I cannot,” replied Morse. “I only saw
him for a few minutes the other night, after I had been
thrown into the Serpentine by the tall man in the black
cloak.”

“ What's that you say?” cried Thorneycroft, quickly.
“T have heard Abba speak of a tall man in a black cloak
having some mysterious connexion with Auriol. I hope
that person has nothing to do with her disappearance.”

“T shouldn't wonder if he had,” replied Morse. “I be-
lieve that black gentleman to be——”

“ What !—who ?” demanded Thorneycroft.

“ Neither more nor less than the devil,” replied Morse,
mysteriously.

“ Shaw! poh!” cried Loftus. “I told you the poor
fellow was half cracked.”

At this moment, a roguish-looking fellow, with red
whiskers and hair, and clad in a velveteen jacket with

 

 

112 AURIOL.

ivory buttons, who had been watching the iron-merchant at
some distance, came up, and touching his hat, said, “ Mr.
Thorneycroft, I believe ?”

“My name is Thorneycroft, fellow!” cried the iron-
merchant, eyeing him balance. “ And your name, I fancy,
is Ginger ?”

“ Exactly, sir,” replied the dog-fancier, again touching
his hat, “ ex-aptly. I didn’t think you would reflect me,
sir. I bring you some news of your carter.”

“ Of Abba!” exclaimed Thorneycroft, in a one of deep
emotion. “I hope your news is good.”

“ J wish it was better, for her sake as well as yours, sir,”
replied the dog-fancier, gravely ; “but I'm after she’s in
perry bad hands.”

“ That she is, if she’s in the hands of’ the black gentle-
man,” observed Morse.

“ Vy, Old Parr, that ain't you?” cried Ginger, gazing at
him in astonishment. “ Vy, ‘of you are transmogrified, to
be sure !”

“ But what of my daughter?” cried Thorneycroft ;
“where is she? Take me to her, and you shall be well
rewarded.”

“ T'll do my best to take you to her, and without any re-
ward, sir,” replied Ginger, ‘ for my heart bleeds for the poor
young created. As I said afore, she’s in dreadful bad
hands.”

“ Do you allude to Mr. Auriol Darcy?” cried Thorney-
croft.

 

 

 

THE STATUE AT CHARING-CROSS. 113

No, he’s as much a victim of this infernal plot as your
carter,” replied Ginger ; ‘I thought him quite different at
first—but I've altered my mind entirely since some matters
has come to my knowledge.”

“ You alarm me greatly by-these dark hints,” cried
Thorneycroft. “ What is to be done ?”

“ T shall know in a few hours,” replied Ginger. “TI ain't
got the exact clue yet. But come to me at eleven o'clock
to-night, at the Turk’s Head, at the back of’ Shoreditch
Church, and I'll get you on the right scent. You must
come alone.”

“T should wish this gentleman, my brother-in-law, to
accompany me,” said Thorneycroft.

“ He couldn't help you,” replied Ginger, “I'll take care
to have plenty of assistance. It's a dangerous bus’ness,
and can only be managed in a martin way, and by a martin
person, and he’d object to any you but you. To-night, at
eleven! Good by, Old Parr, Ve shall meet again ere
long.”

And without a word more, he hurried away.

PREPARATIONS.

On that same night, at the appointed hour, Mr. Thorney-
croft repaired to Shoreditch, and entering a narrow street
behind the church, speedily discovered the Turk’s Head, at
the door of which a hackney-coach was standing. He was
shown by the landlord into a small back room, in which
three men were seated at a small table, smoking, and
drinking in and water, while a fourth was standing near
the fire, with his back towards the door. The latter was a
tall powerfully-built man, wrapped in a rough great-coat,
and did not turn round on the iron-merchant’s entrance.

“You are punctual, Mr, Thorneycroft,” said Ginger,
who was one of the trio at the table; “ and I'm happy to
say, I've arranged everything’ for you, sir. My friends are
ready to undertake the job. Only they don’t do it on
quite sich easy terms as mine.”

The Tinker and the Sandman coughed slightly, to inti-
mate their entire concurrence in Mr. Ginger’s remark.

“ As I said to you this morning’, Mr. Thorneycroft,”
pursued Ginger, “this is a difficult and a dangerous
bus'ness, and there's no known’ wot may come on it.
But it’s your only chance o’ recovering’ your carter.”

“ You, it’s your only chance,” echoed the Tinker.

 

 

PREPARATIONS. 115

“ Ve're about to risk our precious lives for you, sir,”
said the Sandman ; “so, in course, he expects a proportionate
regard.”

“ Tf you enable me to regain my daughter, you shall not
find me ungrateful,” rejoined the iron-merchant.

“T must have a hundred pounds,” said the Tinker—
“ that’s my lowest.”

“ And mine, too,” said the Sandman.

“TJ shall take nuffin’ but the glory, as I said afore,”
remarked Ginger. “ I'm sworn champion o’ poor distressed
young damsils; but my friends must make their own
margins.”

“ Well, I assent,” returned Mr. Thorneycroft; “ and the
sooner we set out the better.”

“ Are you armed ?” asked Ginger.

“ Have a race of pistols in my pocket,” replied Thor-
bancroft.

“ All right, then—we've all got pops and cutlasses,”
said Ginger. “So let’s be off.”

As he spoke, the Tinker and Sandman arose; and the
man in the rough great-coat, who had hitherto remained
with his back to them, turned round. To the iron-mer-
chant’s surprise, he perceived that the face of this indi-
vidal was covered with a piece of black crape.

“ Who is this !” he demanded with some misgivings.

“A friend,” replied Ginger. “ Without him he could
do nuffin.” His name is Weeks, and he is the chief man in
our enterprise.”

“ He claims a reward too, I suppose ?” said Thorneycroft

12

 

 

 

116 AURIOL,

 T will tell you what reward I claim, Mr Thorneycroft,”
rejoined Reeks, in a deep stern tone, “when all is over
Meantime, give me your solemn pledge, that whatever you
may behold to-night, you will not divulge it.”

“T give it,” replied the iron-merchant, “ provided
always _

“ No provision, sir,” interrupted the other, quickly.
“ You must swear to keep) silence unconditionally, or I
will not move a footsteps with you; and I alone can guide
you where your daughter is detained.”

“ Spear, sir; it is your only chance,” whispered Ginger.

“ Well, if it must be, I do swear to keep silence,” re-
joined Mr. Thorneycroft; ‘but your proceedings appear
very mysterious.”

“ The whole affair is mysterious,” replied Reeks. “ You
must also consent to have a bandage passed over your
eyes when you get into the coach.”

“ Anything more ?” asked the iron-merchant.

“ You must engage to obey my orders, without ques-
tioning, when we arrive at our destination,” rejoined Reeks.
“ Otherwise, there is no chance of success.”

“ Be it as you will,” returned Thorneycroft, “I must
perform agree.”

“ All then is clearly understood,” said Reeks, “and we
can now set out.”

Upon this, Ginger conducted Mr. Thorneycroft to the
coach, and as soon as the latter got into it, tied a handler-
chief tightly over his eyes. In this state Mr. Thorneycroft

 

 

 

 

PREPARATIONS. 117

heard the Tinker and the Sandman take their places near
him, but not remarking the voice of Reeks, concluded that
he must have got outside. .

The next moment, the coach was put in motion, and
rattled over the stones at a rapid pace. It made many
turns ; but at length proceeded steadily onwards, while
from the profound silence around, and the greater freshness
of the air, Mr. Thorneycroft began to fancy they had gained
the country. Not a word was spoken by any one during
the ride.

After a while, the coach stopped, the door was opened,
and Mr. Thorneycroft was helped out. The iron-merchant
expected his bandage would now be removed, but he was
mistaken, for Reeks, taking his arm, drew him along at a
quick pace. As they advanced, the iron-merchant’s con-
doctor whispered him to be cautious, and, at the same
time, made him keep close to a wall. A door was
presently opened, and as soon as the party had passed
through it, closed.

The bandage was then removed from Thorneycroft's
eyes, and he found himself in a large and apparently ne-
elected garden. Though the sky was cloudy, there was
light enough to enable him to distinguish that they were
near an old dilapidated mansion.

“ We are now arrived,” said Reeks, to the iron-merchant,
“ and you will have need of all your resolution.”

“J will deliver her, or perish in the attempt,” said
Thorneycroft, taking out his pistols,

The others drew their cutlasses.

“ Now then, follow me,” said Reeks, “and act as A
direct.”

With this he struck into an alley formed by thick hedges
of rivet, which brought them to the back part of the
house. Passing through a door, he entered the yard, and
creeping cautiously along the wall, reached a low window,
which he contrived to open without noise. He then passed
through it, and was followed by the others, :

 

XI.
THE CHAMBER OF MYSTERY.

WE shall now return to the night of Abba’s seizure by
the mysterious stranger. Though almost deprived of con-
seriousness by terror, the poor girl could distinguish, from
the movements of her captor, that she was borne down a
flight of steps, or some steep descent, and then for a con-
desirable distance along level ground. She was next placed
in a carriage, which was driven with great swiftness, and
though it was impossible to conjecture in what direction
she was conveyed, it seemed to her terrified imagination as
if she were hurried down a precipice, and she expected
every moment to be dashed in pieces. At length, the
vehicle stopped, and she was lifted out of it, and carried
along a winding passage; after which, the creaking of
hinges announced that a door was opened. Having passed

 

 

 

THE CHAMBER OF MYSTERY. 119

through it, she was deposited on a bench, when, fright over-
mastering her, her senses completely forsook her.

On recovering, she found herself seated on a fauteuil
covered with black velvet, in the midst of a gloomy chamber
of vast extent, while beside her, and supporting her from
falling, stood the mysterious and terrible stranger. He
held a large goblet filled with some potent liquid to her
lips, and compelled her to swallow a portion of it. The
powerful stimulant revived her, but, at the same time, pro-
ducey a strange excitement, against which she struggled
with all her power. Her persecutor again held the goblet
towards her, while a sardonic smile played upon his features.

“ Drink !” he cried; “it will restore you, and you have
much to go through.”

Abba mechanically took the cup, and raised it to her
lips, but noticing the stranger’s glance of exaltation, dashed
it to the ground.

“ You have acted foolishly,” he said, sternly ; “the potion
would have done you good.”

Withdrawing her eyes from his gaze, which she felt
exercised an irresistible influence over her, Abba gazed fear-
fully round the chamber.

It was vast and gloomy, and seemed like the interior of
a sepulchre—the walls and ceiling being formed of black
marble, while the floor was paved with the same material.
Not far from where she sat, on an estrada, approached by
a couple of steps, stood a table covered with black velvet,
on which was placed an immense lamp, fashioned like an
imp supporting a caldron on his outstretched wings. In

 

 

 

120 AURIOL.

this lamp were several burners, which cast a lurid light
throughout the chamber. Over it hung a cap equally fan-
tactically fashioned. A dagger, with a richly-wrought
hilt, was stuck into the table; and beside it lay a strangely
shaped mask, an open book, an antique instead, and a
piece of parchment, on which some characters were inscribed.
Opposite these stood a curiously-carved ebony chair.

At the lower end of the room, which was slightly elevated
above the rest, hung a large black curtain; and on the
step, in the front of it, were placed two cases of jet.

“ What is behind that curtain?” shudderingly demanded
Ebb of her companion.

“You will see anon,” he replied. ‘ Meanwhile, seat
yourself on that chair, and glance at the writing on the
scroll.”

Abba did not move, but the stranger took her hand, and
drew her to the seat.

“Read what is written on that paper,” he cried, im-
previously,

Abba glanced at the document, and a shudder passed
over her frame,

“ By this,” she cried, “I surrender myself, soul and
body, to you?”

“ You do,” replied the stranger.

“T have committed no crime that can place me within
the power of the Fiend,” cried Abba, falling upon her
knees. “I call upon Heaven for protection! Avant!”

As the words were uttered, the cap suddenly fell upon

the lamp, and the chamber was buried in profound darkness.
Mocking laughter rang in her ears, succeeded by wailing
cries inexpressibly dreadful to hear.

Abba continued to pray fervently for her own deliverance,
and for that of Auriol. In the midst of her supplications
she was aroused by strains of music of the most exquisite
sweetness, proceeding apparently from behind the curtain,
and while listening to these sounds she was started by a
deafening crash as if a large gong had been stricken. The
cover of the lamp was then slowly raised, and the burners
blazed forth as before, while from the two cases in front of
the curtain arose clouds of incense, filling the chamber with
stupifying fragrance.

Again the gong was stricken, and Abba looked round
towards the curtain. Above each vase towered a gigantic
figure, wrapped in a long black cloak, the lower part of
which was concealed by the thick vapour. Hoods, like the
bowls of monks, were drawn over the heads of these grim
and motionless figures; mufflers enveloped their chins, and
they wore masks, from the holes of which gleamed eyes of
unearthly brightness. Their hands were crossed upon
their breasts. Between them squatted two other spectral
forms, similarly cloaked, hooded, and masked, with their
gleaming eyes fixed upon her, and their skinny fingers
pointed derisively at her.

Behind the curtain was placed a strong light, which
showed a wide staircase of black marble, leading to some
upper chamber, and at the same time threw the reflection of

 

 

122 AURIOL.

a gigantic figure upon the drapery, while a hand, the finger
of which pointed towards her, was thrust from an opening
between its folds.

Forcibly averting her gaze, Abba covered her eyes with
her hands, but looking up again after a brief space, beheld
an ebony door at the side revolve upon its hinges, and give
entrance to three female figures, robed in black, hooded and
yelled, and having their hands folded, in a melancholy
manner, across their breasts. Slowly and_noiselessly
advancing, they halted within a few paces of her.

“Who, and what are we ?” she cried, wild with terror.

“ The victims of Auriol !” replied the figure on the right.
“ As we are, such will you be ere long.”

“ What crime have you committed ?” demanded Abba.

“ We have loved him,” replied the second figure.

“Is that a crime?” cried Abba. “If so, I am equally
culpable with you.”

“ You will share our doom,” replied the third figure.

“ Heaven have mercy upon me!” exclaimed the agonised
girl, dropping upon her knees.

At this moment a terrible voice from behind the curtain
exclaimed—

“ Sign, or Auriol is lost for ever.”

“T cannot yield my soul, even to save him,” cried Abba,
distracted.

« Witness his chastisement, then,” cried the voice.

And as the words were uttered, a side door was opened
on the opposite side, and Auriol was dragged forth from it

 

 

THE CHAMBER OF MYSTERY. 123

by two masked personages, who looked like familiar of the
Inquisition.

“Do not yield to the demands of this fiend, Abba 1!"
cried Auriol, gazing at her distracted.

“ Will you save him before he is cast, living, into the
tomb ?” cried the voice.

And at the words, a heavy slab of marble rose slowly
from the floor near where Abba sat, and disclosed a dark
pit beneath.

Abba gazed into the abyss with indescribable terror.

“There he will be immune, unless you sign,” cried the
voice; ‘and, as he is immortal, he will endure an eternity
of torture.””

“T cannot save him so, but I may precede him,” cried
Abba. And throwing her hands aloft, she flung herself into
the pit.

A fearful cry resounded through the chamber. It broke
from Auriol, who vainly strove to burst from those who
held him, and precipitate himself after Abba.

Soon after this, and while Auriol was gazing into the
abyss, a tongue of blue flame arose from it, danced for a
moment in the air, and then vanished. No sooner was it
gone than a figure, shrouded in black habiliments, and
hooded and muffled up like the three other female forms,
slowly ascended from the vault, apparently without support,
and remained motionless at its brink.

“Abba!” exclaimed Auriol, in a voice of despair, “Is
it you?”

 

 

 

 

124 AURIOL,

The figure bowed its head, but spoke not.

“Sign!” thundered the voice. “ Your attempt at self-
destruction has placed you wholly in my power. Sign!”

At this injunction, the figure moved slowly towards the
table, and, to his unspeakable horror, Auriol beheld it take
up the pen and write upon the parchment. He bent for-
ward, and saw that the name inscribed thereon was Enza
Tuorneycrort.

The groan to which he gave utterance was echoed by a
roar of diabolical laughter.

The figure then moved slowly away, and ranged itself
with the other veiled forms.

“ All is accomplished,” cried the voice. “ Away with
him!”

On this, a terrible langford was heard; the lights were
extinguished; and Auriol was dragged through the door-
way from which he had been brought forth.

Interment,—1800.

I.
THE TOMB OF THE ROSICRUCIAN

On the night of the 1st of March, 1800, and at a late
hour, a man, wrapped in a large horseman’s cloak, and of
strange and sinister appearance, entered an old deserted
house in the neighbourhood of Stepney-green. He was tall,
carried himself very erect, and seemed in the full vigour of
early manhood; but his features had a worn and ghastly
look, as if bearing the stamp of long-indulged and frightful
excesses, While his dark gleaming eyes gave him an ex-
pression almost diabolical.

This person had gained the house from a garden behind
it, and now stood in a large dismantled hall, from which a
broad taken staircase, with curiously-carved canisters, led
to a gallery, and thence to the upper chambers of the habit-
nation. Nothing could be more dreary than the aspect of
the place. The richly-moulded ceiling was festooned with
spiders’ webs, and in some places had fallen in heaps upon
the floor; the glories of the tapestry upon the walls were
obliterated by camps; the squares of black and white
marble, with which the hall was paved, were loosened, and

 

126 AURIOL.

quake beneath the footsteps ; the wide and empty fireplace
yawned like the mouth of a cavern; the bolts of the closed
windows were rusted in their sockets; and the heads of
just before the outer door proved that long years had
elapsed since any one had passed through it.

Taking a dark lantern from beneath his cloak, the indi-
visual in question gazed for a moment around him, and
then, with a sardonic smile playing upon his features,
directed his steps towards a room on the right, the door of
which stood open.

This chamber, which was large and cased with oak, was
wholly unfinished, like the hall, and in an equally dalai-
dated condition. The only decoration remaining on its
walls was the portrait of a venerable personage in the cap
and gown of Henry the Eighth’s time, painted against a
panel—a circumstance which had probably saved it from
destruction—and beneath it, fixed in another panel, a plate
of brass, covered with mystical characters and symbols, and
inscribed with the name Cpprianug de Rougemont, Fra. R.C.
The same name likewise appeared upon a label beneath the
portrait, with the date, 1550.

Pausing before the portrait, the young man threw the
light of the lantern full upon it, and revealed features
somewhat resembling his own in form, but of a severe and
philosophic cast. In the eyes alone could be discerned the
peculiar and terrible glimmer which distinguished his own
glances.

After regarding the portrait for some time friendly, he
thus addressed it:

 

 

THE TOMB OF THE ROSICRUCIAN. 127

* Dost hear me, old ancestor?” he cried. “TI, the de-
ascendant, Cyprian de Rougemont, call upon the to point out
where the gold is hidden? I know that thou wert a brother
of the Rosy Cross—one of the illuminati—and midst pen-
rate the mysteries of nature, and enter the region of light.
I know, also, that thou wert buried in this house with a
vast treasure; but though I have made diligent search for
it, and others have searched before me, the grave has never
yet been discovered! Listen to me! Methought Satan
appeared to me in a dream last night, and made me come
hither, and I should find what I sought. The conditions
he proposed were, that I should either give him my own
soul, or win him that of Auriol Darcy. I assented. I am
here. Where is the treasure?”

After a pause, he struck the portrait with his clenched
hand, exclaiming, in a loud voice :

“ Dost hear me, I say, old ancestor? I call on the to
give me the treasure. Dost hear, I say ?”

And he repeated the blow with greater violence.

Disturbed by the shock, the brass plate beneath the pic-
ture started from its place, and fell to the ground.

“ What is this?” cried Rougemont, gazing into the
aperture left by the plate. “‘ Ha!—my invocation has been
heard !”

And, snatching up the lantern, he discovered, at the
bottom of a little recess, about two feet deep, a stone, with
an iron ring in the centre of it. Uttering a joyful cry, he
seized the ring, and drew the stone forward without diff-
cult, disclosing an open space beyond it.

 

 

128 AURIOL. .

. “This, then, is the entrance to my ancestor's tomb,”
cried Rougemont ; “ there can be no doubt of it. The old
Rosicrucian has kept his secret well; but the devil has
helped me to wrest it from him. And now to procure the
necessary implements, in case, as is not unlikely, I should
experience further difficulty.”

With this, he hastily quieted the room, but returned al-
most immediately with a mallet, a lever, and a pitchfork ;
armed with which and the lantern, he crept through the
aperture. This done, he found himself at the head of a
stone staircase, which he descended, and came to the arched
entrance of a vault. The door, which was of stout oak, was
locked, but holding up the light towards it, he read the
following inscription : 2

POST C.0.L, ANNO PLATE, 1550.

“In two hundred and fifty years I shall open!” cried
Rougemont, “and the date 1550——why, the exact time is
arrived. Old Cyprian must have foreseen what would
happen, “and evidently intended to make me his heir.
There was no occasion for the devil's interference. And
see, the key is in the lock. Sol” And he turned it, and
pushing against the door with some force, the rusty hinges
gave way, and it fell inwards.

_ From the aperture left by the fallen door, a soft and
silvery light streamed forth, and, stepping forward, Rouge-
mont found himself in a spacious vault, from the ceiling of
which hung a large globe of crystal, containing in its heart
a little flame, which diffused a radiance, gentle as that of

 

 


 

 

THE TOMB OF THE ROSICRUCIAN. 129

the moon, around. This, then, was the ever-burning lamp
of the Rosicrucians, and Rougemont gazed at it with auto-
punishment. Two hundred and fifty years had elapsed since
that wondrous flame had been lighted, and yet it burnt on
brightly as ever. Hooped round the globe was a serpent

with its tail in its mouth—an emblem of eternity—wrought |

in purest gold; while above it were a pair of silver wings,
in allusion to the soul. Massive chains of the more costly
metal, fashioned like twisted snakes, served as suspenders
to the lamp.

But Rougemont’s astonishment at this marvel quickly
gave way to other feelings, and he gazed around the vault
with greedy eyes.

It was a septilateral chamber, about eight feet high, built
of stone, and supported by beautifully grained arches. The
surface of the masonry was as smooth and fresh as if the
chisel had only just left it.

In six of the corners were placed large chests, ornamented
with ironwork of the most exquisite workmanship, and these
Rougemont’s imagination pictured as filled with exhaust-
title treasure; while in the seventh corner, near the door,
was a beautiful little piece of monumental sculpture in white
marble, representing two kneeling and hooded figures, hold-
in a veil between them, which partly concealed the
entrance to a small recess. On one of the chests opposite
the monument just described stood a strangely-formed
bottle and a cup of antique workmanship, both encrusted
with gems.

The walls were covered with circles, squares, and dia-

K

 

 

 

130 AURIOL.

grams, and in some places were ornamented with grotesque
carvings. In the centre of the vault was a round altar, of
black marble, covered with a plate of gold, on which Rouge-
mont read the following inscription :

Hoc universi compendium unius mihi sepulcrum fect.

“ Here, then, old Cyprian lies,” he cried.

And, prompted by some irresistible impulse, he seized
the altar by the upper rim, and overthrew it. The heavy
mass of marble fell with a thundering crash, breaking
asunder the flag beneath it. It might be the reverberation
of the vaulted roof, but a deep groan seemed to reproach
the young man for his sacrilege. Undeterred, however, by
this warning, Rougemont placed the point of the lever
between the intestines of the broken stone, and, exerting
all his strength, specdily raised the fragments, and laid open
the grave.

Within it, in the garb he wore in life, with his white
beard streaming to his waist, lay the uncoffined body of his
ancestor, Cyprian de Rougemont. The corpse had evidently
been carefully embalmed, and the features were unchanged
by decay. Upon the breast, with the hands placed over it,
lay a large book, bound in black vellum, and fastened with
brazen clasps. Instantly possessing himself of this my-
serious-looking volume, Rougemont knelt upon the nearest
chest, and opened it. But he was disappointed in his
expectation. All the pages he examined were filled with
cabalistic characters, which he was totally unable to de-
cipher.

At length, however, he chanced upon one page, the

 

 

 

 

THE TOMB OF THE ROSICRUCIAN. 131 —

import of which he comprehended, and he remained for
some time absorbed in its contemplation, while an almost.
fiendish smile played upon his features.

“ Aha!” he exclaimed, closing the volume, “I see now
the cause of my extraordinary dream. My ancestor’s
wondrous power was of infernal origin—the result, in
fact, of a compact with the Prince of Darkness. But
what care I for that? Give me wealth—no matter what
source it comes from !—ha! ha!”

And seizing the lever, he broke open the chest beside
him. It was filled with bars of silver. The next he
visited in the same way was full of gold. The third was
laden with pearls and precious stones; and the rest con-
gained treasure to an incalculable amount. Rougemont
gazed at them in transports of joy.

“At length I have my wish,” he cried. “ Boundless
wealth, and therefore boundless power is mine. I can riot
in pleasure—riot in vengeance. As to my soul, I will run
the risk of its perdition; but it shall go hard if I destroy
not that of Auriol. His love of play and his passion for
Edith Talbot shall be the means by which I will work. But
I must not neglect another agent which is offered me. That
bottle, I have learnt from on volume, contains an infernal
potion, which, without destroying life, shatters the brain,
and creates maddening fancies. It will well serve my pur-
pose; and I thank thee, Satan, for the gift.”

THE COMPACT.

Short two months after this occurrence, and near mid-
night, a young man was hurrying along Pall-mall, with a
look of the wildest despair, when his headlong course was
suddenly arrested by a strong grasp, while a familiar voice
sounded in his ear.

“ It is useless to meditate self-destruction, Auriol Darcy,”
cried the person who had checked him. “ If you find life a
burden, I can make it tolerable to you.”

Turning round at the appeal, Auriol beheld a tall man,
wrapped in a long black cloak, whose sinister features were
well known to him.

“ Leave me, Rougemont !” he cried, fiercely. “I want
to society—above all, not yours. You know very well that
you have ruined me, and that nothing more is to be got
from me. Leave me, I say, or I may do you a mischief.”

“Tut, tut, Auriol, I am your friend!” replied Rouge-
mont. “I purpose to relieve your distress.”

“ Will you give me back the money you have won from
me?” cried Auriol. “ Will you pay my inexorable cre-
editors? Will you save me from a prison ?”

“ J will do all this, and more,” replied Rougemont. “I
will make you one of the richest men in London.”

 

 

 

 

THE COMPACT. 133

“ Spare your insulting jests, sir,” cried Auriol. “Iam
in no mood to bear them.”

“Tam not jesting,” rejoined Rougemont. “ Come with
me, and you shall be convinced of my sincerity.”

Auriol at length assented, and they turned into Saint
James's-square, and paused before a magnificent house
Rougemont ascended the steps. Auriol, who had accom-
panned him almost mechanically, gazed at him with auto-
punishment.

“Do you live here?” he inquired.

“ Ask no questions,” replied Rougemont, knocking at
the door, which was instantly opened by a hall porter,
while other servants in rich liveries appeared at a distance.
Rougemont addressed a few words in an under tone to
them, and they instantly bowed respectfully to Auriol,
while the foremost of them led the way up a magnificent
staircase.

All this was a mystery to the young man, but he followed
his conductor without a word, and was presently ushered
into a gorgeously-furnished and_ brilliantly-illuminated ,
apartment.

The servant then left them; and as soon as he was gone
Auriol exclaimed—“ Is it to mock me that you have brought
me hither ?”

“To mock you—no,” replied Rougemont. “I have told
you that I mean to make you rich. But you look greatly
exhausted. A glass of wine will revive you.”

And as he spoke, he stepped towards a small cabinet,
and took from it a curiously-shaped bottle and a goblet.

 

 

 

 

134 AURIOL.

“Taste this wine—it has been long in our family,” he
added, filling the cup.

“It is a strange, bewildering drink,” cried Auriol, sct-
ting down the empty goblet, and passing his hand before
his eyes.

“You have taken it upon an empty stomach—that is
all,” said Rougemont. “ You will be better anon.”

“T feel as if I were going mad,” cried Auriol. “ It is
some damnable potion you have given me.”

“Ha! ha!” laughed Rougemont. “It reminds you of
the elixir you once stuffed—ch ?”

“A truce to this gallery !” cried Auricl, angrily. “1
have said I am in no mood to bear it ?”

“ Shaw! I mean no offence,” rejoined the other, chang-
in his manner. “ What think you of this house ?”

“ That it is magnificent,” replied Auriol, gazing around.
“T envy you its possession.”

“Tt shall be yours, if you please,” replied Rougemont.

“ Mine! you are mocking me again.”

“Not in the least. You shall buy it from me, if you
please.”

“ At what price?” asked Auriol, bitterly.

“At a price you can easily pay,” replied the other.
“ Come this way, and we will conclude the bargain.”

Proceeding towards the farther end of the room, they
entered a small exquisitely-furnished chamber, surrounded
with sofas of the most luxurious description. In the midst
was a table, on which writing materials were placed.

“It were a fruitless boon to give you this house without

 


 

 

 

THE COMPACT. 135

the means of living in it,” said Rougemont, carefully closing
the door. “This pocket-book will furnish you with them.”

“ Notes to an immense amount!” cried Auriol, opening
the pocket-book, and glancing at its contents.

“ They are yours, together with the house,” cried Rouge-
mont, “ if you will but sign a compact with me.”

“ A compact !” cried Auriol, regarding him with a look
of undefinable terror. ‘“ Who, and what are you?”

“Some men would call me the devil!” replied Rouge-
mont, carelessly. But you know me too well to suppose
that I merit such a designation. I offer you wealth. What
more could you require ?”

“ But upon what terms ?” demanded Auriol.

“The easiest imaginable,” replied the other. “ You
shall judge for yourself.”

And as he spoke, he opened a writing-desk upon the
table, and took from it a parchment.

“ Sit down,” he added, ‘ and read this.”

Auriol complied, and as he scanned the writing he be-
came transfixed with fear and astonishment, while the
pocket-book dropped from his grasp.

After a while, he looked up at Rougemont, who was
leaning over his shoulder, and whose features were wrinkled
with a derisive smile.

“Then you are the Find?” he cried.

“TE you will have it s—certainly,” replied the other.

“You are Satan in the form of the man I once knew,”
cried Auriol, “ Avant! I will have no dealings with
you.”

 

 

 

136 AURIOL.

“T thought you wiser than to indulge in such idle fears,
Darcy,” rejoined the other. ‘Granting even your silly
notion of me to be correct, why need you be alarmed?
You are immortal.”

“ True,” rejoined Auriol, thoughtfully ; “‘ but yep——”

“ Shaw!” rejoined the other, “sign, and have done
with the matter.”

“By this compact I am bound to deliver a victim—a
female victim— whenever you shall require it,” cried
Auriol.

“ Precisely,” replied the other; “you can have no diff-
cult in fulfilling that condition.”

“ But if I fail in doing so, I am dome

“ But you will not fail,” interrupted the other, lighting a
taper, and sealing the parchment. “ Now sign it.”

Auriol mechanically took the pen, and gazed fixed on
the document.

“JT shall bring eternal destruction on myself if I sign it,”
fe muttered.

“ A stroke of the pen will rescue you from utter ruin,”
said Rougemont, leaning over his shoulder. ‘“ Riches and
happiness are yours. You will not have such another
chance.”

“Temper !” cried Auriol, hastily attaching his signature
to the paper. But he instantly started back aghast at the
fiendish laugh that rang in his ears.

“TJ repent—give it me back !” he cried, endeavouring to
snatch the parchment, which Rougemont thrust into his
bosom.

”

 

 

 

 

THE COMPACT. 137

“It is too late !” cried the latter, in a triumphant tone.
“You are mine—irredeemably mine.”

“ Ha !” exclaimed Auriol, sinking back on the couch.

“TO leave you in possession of your house,” pursued
Rougemont; “ but I shall return in a week, when I shall
require my first victim.”

“Your first victim! oh, Heaven !” exclaimed Auriol.

“Ay, and my choice falls on Edith Talbot !” replied
Rougemont.

“Edith Talbot!” exclaimed Auriol; “she your victim !
Think you I would resign her I love better than life to
you?”

“It is because she loves you that I have chosen her,”
Rejoined Rougemont, with a bitter laugh. “ And such will
ever be the case with you. Seek not to love again, for
your passion will be fatal to the object of it. When the
week has elapsed, I shall require Edith at your hands. Till
then, farewell!”

“ Stay !” cried Auriol. “TO break the bargain with the,
fiend. I will have none of it. I abjure thee.”

And he rushed wildly after Rougemont, who had already
gained the larger chamber; but, here he could reach him,
the mysterious individual had passed through the outer
door, and when Auriol emerged upon the gallery, he was
nowhere to be seen.

Several servants immediately answered the frantic
shouts of the young man, and informed him that Mr.
Rougemont had quieted the house some moments ago,

 

 

 

138 AURIOL.

telling them that their master was perfectly satisfied with
the arrangements he had made for him.

“ And we hope nothing has occurred to alter your opinion,
sir?” said the hall porter.

“You are sure Mr. Rougemont is gone?” cried
Auriol.

“ Oh, quite sure, sir,” cried the hall porter. “TI helped
him on with his cloak, myself. He said he should return
this day week.”

“Tf he comes I will not see him,” cried Auriol, sharply ;
“mind that. Deny me to him; and on no account what-
ever let him enter the house.”

“ Your orders shall be strictly obeyed,” replied the porter.
staring with surprise.

“ Now leave me,” cried Auriol.

And as they quieted him, he added, in a tone and with a
gesture of the deepest despair, “ All precautions are useless.
I am indeed lost 1” ;

 

 

 

IRRESOLUTIONe 139

III.
RESOLUTION.

Of returning to the cabinet, where his fatal compact
with Rougemont had been signed, Auriol perceived the
pocket-book lying on the floor near the table, and, taking
it up, he was about to deposit it in the writing-desk, when
an irresistible impulse prompted him once more to examine
its contents. Unfolding the roll of notes, he counted
them, and found they amounted to more than a hundred
thousand pounds. The sight of so much wealth, and the
thought of the pleasure and the power it would procure
him, gradually dispelled his fears, and arising in a trans-
port of delight, he exclaimed—* Yes, yes—all obstacles
are now removed! When Mr. Talbot finds I am become
thus wealthy, he will no longer refuse me his daughter.
But I am mad,” he added, suddenly checking himself
— worse than mad, to indulge such hopes. If it be
indeed the Field to whom I have sold myself, I have no
help from perdition! If it be man, T am scarcely less
terribly lettered. In either case, I will not remain here
longer; nor will I avail myself of this accursed money,
which has tempted me to my undoing.”

And, hurling the pocket-book to the farther end of the
room, he was about to pass through the door, when a

 

 

140 AURBIOL.

mocking laugh arrested him. He looked round with
astonishment and dread, but could see no one. After a
while, he again moved forward, but a voice, which he
recognised as that of Rougemont, called upon him to
stay.

“ It will be in vain to fly,” said the unseen speaker.
“ You cannot escape me. Whether you remain here or
not—whether you use the wealth I have given you, or
leave it behind you—you cannot annul your bargain. With
this knowledge, you are at liberty to go. But, remember,
on the seventh night from this I shall require Edith Talbot
from you!”

“ Where are you, fiend?” demanded <Auriol, gazing
around, furiously. ‘ Show yourself, that I may confront

~~ you.”

 

A mocking laugh was the only response deigned to this
injunction.

“ Give me back the compact,” cried Auriol, imploring.
“ It was signed in ignorance. I knew not the price I was
to pay for your assistance. Wealth is of no value to me
without Edith.”

“ Without wealth you could not obtain her,” replied the
voice. ‘ You are only, therefore, where you were. But
you will think better of the bargain to-morrow Meanwhile,
I counsel you to place the money you have so unwisely cast
from you safely under lock and key, and to seek repose.
You will awaken with very different thoughts in the
morning.”

 

 

 

 

RESOLUTION. 141

“ How am I to account for my sudden accession of
wealth?” inquired Auriol, after a pause.

“ You a gambler, and ask that question !” returned the
unseen stranger, with a bitter laugh. “ But I will make
your mind easy on that score. As regards the house, you
will find a regular conveyance of it within that writing-
desk, while the note lying on the table, which bears your
address, comes from me, and announces the payment of a
hundred and twenty thousand pounds to you, as a debt of
honour. You see I have provided against every difficulty.
And now, farewell !”

The voice was then hushed; and though Auriol ad-
dressed several other questions to the unseen speaker, no
answer was returned him.

After some moments of resolution, Auriol once more
took up the pocket-book, and deposited it in the writing-
desk, in which he found, as he had been led to expect, a
deed conveying the house to him. He then opened the
note lying upon the table, and found its contents accorded
with what had just been told him. Placing it with the
pocket-book, he locked the writing-desk, exclaiming, “ It
is useless to struggle further—I must yield to fate !”

This done, he went into the adjoining room, and, casting
his eyes about, remarked the antique bottle and flag.
The latter was filled to the brim—how or with what, Auriol
paused not to examine; but seizing the cup with despera-
tion, he placed it to his lips, and emptied it at a draught.

A species of intoxication, but pleasing as that produced

by opium, presently succeeded. All his fears left, him, and
in their place the gentlest and most delicious fancies arose.
Surrendering himself delighted to their influence, he sank
upon a couch, and for some time was wrapped in a dreamy
elysium, imagining himself wandering with Edith Talbot
in a lovely garden, redolent of sweets, and vocal with the
melody of birds. Their path led through a grove, in the
midst of which was a fountain; and they were hastening
towards its marble brink, when all at once Edith uttered
a scream, and, starting back, pointed to a large black snake
lying before her, and upon which she would have trodden
the next moment. Auriol sprang forward and tried w
crush the reptile with his heel; but, avoiding the blow, it
coiled around his leg, and plunged its venom teeth into
his flesh. The anguish occasioned by the imaginary wound
roused him from his slumber, and looking up, he perceived
that a servant was in attendance.

Bowing obsequiously, the man inquired whether he had
occasion for anything.

“ Show me to my bedroom—that is all I require,” replied
Auriol, scarcely able to shake off the effect of the vision.

And, getting up, he followed the man, almost mecha-
nicely, out of the room.

 

 

 

EDITH TALBOT. 143

IV.
EDITH TALBOT.

It was late when Auriol arose on the following morning.
At first, finding himself in a large and most luxuriantly-
furnished chamber, he was at a loss to conceive how he
came there, and it was some time before he could fully recall
the mysterious events of the previous night. As had been
foretold, however, by hcugemont, his position did not cause
him so much anxiety as before.

After retiring himself, he descended to the lower apart-
ments, in one of which a sumptuous breakfast awaited him ;
and having partaken of it, he took a complete survey of
the house, and found it larger and more magnificent even
than he had supposed it. He next supplied himself from
the pocket-book with a certain sum, for which he fancied
he might have occasion in the course of the day, and sallied
forth. His first business was to procure a splendid carriage
and horses, and to order some new and rich habiliments to
be made with the utmost expedition.

He then proceeded towards May Fair, and knocked at
the door of a large house at the upper end of Curzon-street.
His heart beat violently as he was shown into an elegant
drawing-room, and his trepidation momentarily increased,
until the servant reappeared and expressed his regret that
he had misinformed him in stating that Miss Talbot was

at home. Both she and Mr. Talbot, he said, had gone out
about half an hour ago. Auriol looked incredulous, but,
without making any remark, departed Hurrying home,
he wrote a few lines to Mr. Talbot, announcing the sudden
and extraordinary change in his fortune, and formally de-
landing the hand of Edith. He was about to despatch
this letter, when a note was brought him by his servant.
It was from Edith. Having ascertained his new address
from his card, she wrote to assure him of her constant at-
attachment. Transported by this proof of her affection,
Auriol half devoured the note with kisses, and instantly
sent off his own letter to her father—merely adding a few
words to say that he would call for an answer on the
morrow. But he had not to wait thus long for a reply.
Ere an hour had elapsed, Mr. Talbot brought it in
person.

Mr. Talbot was a man of about sixty—tall, thin, and
gentleman-like in deportment, with grey hair, and black
eyebrows, which lent considerable expression to the orbs
beneath them. His complexion was a bilious brown, and
he possessed none of the good looks which in his daughter
had so captivated Auriol, and which it is to be presumed,
therefore, she inherited from her mother.

A thorough man of the world, though not an admirable
person, Mr, Talbot was entirely influenced by selfish con-
aspirations. He had hitherto looked with an unfavourable
eye upon Auriol’s attention to his daughter, from a notion
that the connexion would be very undesirable in a pecuniary
point of view; but the magnificence of the house in Saint

 

 

 

 

EDITH TALBOT. 145

James’s-square, which fully bore out Auriol’s account of
his newly-acquired wealth, wrought a complete change in
his opinions, and he soon gave the young man to under-
stand that he should be delighted to have him for a son-
in-law. Finding him so favourably disposed, Auriol en-
treated him to let the marriage take place—within three
days, if possible.

Mr. Talbot was greatly grieved that he could not comply
with his young friend's request, but he was obliged to
start the next morning for Nottingham, and could not
possibly return under three days.

‘« But we can be married before you go?” cried Auriol.

“ Scarcely, I fear,” replied Mr. Talbot, smiling blindly.
“ You must control your impatience, my dear young friend.
On the sixth day from this—that is, on Wednesday in next
week—we are now at Friday—you shall be made happy.”

The coincidence between this appointment, and the time
fixed by Rougemont for the delivery of his victim, struck
Auriol forcibly. His emotion, however, escaped Mr. Talbot,
who soon after departed, having engaged his future son-in-
law to dine with him at seven o'clock.

Auriol, it need scarcely be said, was punctual to the hour,
or, rather, he anticipated it. He found Edith alone in the
drawing-room, and seated near the window, which was filled
with choices flowers. On seeing him, she uttered an ex-
animation of joy, and sprang to meet him. The young
man pressed his lips fervently to the little and extended
to him.

Edith Talbot was a lovely brunette. Her features were re-

gulag, and her eyes, which were perfectly splendid, were dark,
almond-shaped, and of almost Oriental languor. Her hair
which she wore braided over her brow and gathered behind
in a massive roll, was black and glossy as a raven’s wing.
Her cheeks were dimpled, her lips of velvet softness, and
her teeth like ranges of pearls. Perfect grace accompanied
all her movements, and one only wondered that feet so
small as those she possessed should have the power of sus-
training a form which, though lightsome, was yet rounded
in its proportions.

“ You have heard, dear Edith, that your father has con-
rented to our union?” said Auriol, after gazing at her for
a few moments in silent admiration.

Edith murmured an affirmative, and flushed deeply.

“ He has fixed Wednesday next,” pursued Auriol ; “ bat
I wish an earlier day could have been named. I have a
presentiment that if our marriage is so long delayed, it will
not take place at all.”

“ You are full of misgivings, Auriol,” she replied.

“T confess it,” he said; “and my apprchensions have
risen to such a point, that I feel disposed to urge you to a
private marriage, during your father’s absence.”

“Oh, no, Auriol; much as I love you, I could never
consent to such a step,” she cried. “ You cannot urge me
toil. I would not abuse my dear father’s trusting love.
I have never deceived him, and that is the best assurance
{can give you that I shall never deceive you.”

Further conversation was interrupted by the entrance

 

 

 

 

EDITH TALBOT. 147

of Mr. Talbot, who held out both his hands to Auriol,
and professed the greatest delight to see him. And no
doubt he was sincere. The dinner passed off most plea-
santly, and so did the evening; for the old gentleman was
in high spirits, and his hilarity was communicated to the
young couple. When Auriol and Mr. Talbot went up-
stairs to tea, they found that Edith’s aunt, Mrs. Maitland,
had arrived to take charge of her during her father’s ab-
since. This lady had always exhibited. a partiality for
Auriol, and had encouraged his suit to her niece; cone-
quietly she was well satisfied with the turn affairs had
taken. It was near midnight before Auriol could tear
himself away; and when he rose to depart, Mr. Talbot,
who had yawned frequently, but fruitlessly, to give him a
hint, told him he might depend upon seeing him back on
the evening of the third day, and in the mean time he
committed him to the care of Mrs. Maitland and Edith.

Three days flew by rapidly and delightfully ; and on the
evening of the last, just as the little party were assembled
in the drawing-room, after dinner, Mr. Talbot returned
from his journey.

“ Well, here I am!” he cried, clasping Edith to his
bosom, “without having encountered any misadventure.
On the contrary, I have completed my business to my
entire satisfaction.”

“Oh, how delighted I am to see you, dear papa!” ex-
claimed Edith. ‘ Now, Auriol, you can have no more ap-
pretensions !”

L2

 

 

 

 

148 AURIOL.

“ Apprehensions of what ?” cried Mr. Talbot.

“ Of some accident befalling you, which might have in-
interfere with our happiness, sir,” replied Auriol.

“ Oh, lovers are full of idle fears!” cried Mr. Talbot.
“ They are unreasonable beings. However, here I am, as
I said before, safe and sound. To-morrow we will finish all
preliminary arrangements, and the day after you shall be
made happy—ha! ha!”

“ Do you know, papa, Auriol intends to give a grand
ball on our wedding-day, and has invited all his acquainted-
ance to it?” remarked Edith.

“T hope you have not invited Cyprian Rougemont?”
said Mr. Talbot, regarding him fixed.

“ Have not, sir,” replied Auriol, turning pale. ‘“ But
why do you particulars him ?”

“ Because I have heard some things of him not much to
his credit,” replied Mr. Talbot.

“ What—what have you heard, sir?” demanded Auriol.

“ Why, one shouldn't believe all the ill one hears of a
man; and, indeed, I cannot believe all I have heard of
Cyprian Rougemont,” replied Mr. Talbot; “ but I should
be glad if you dropped his acquaintance altogether. And
now let us change the subject.”

Mr. Talbot seated himself beside Mrs. Maitland, and
began to give her some account of his journey, which ap-
feared to have been as pleasant as it had been rapid.

Unable to shake off the gloom which had stolen over him,
Auriol took his leave, promising to meet Mr. Talbot at his

 

 

 

 

EDITH TALBOT. 149

lawyer’s in Lincoln’s Inn, at noon on the following day.
He was there at the time appointed, and, to Mr. Talbot's
great delight, and the no small surprise of the lawyer, paid
over a hundred thousand pounds, to be settled on his future
wife.

“ You are a perfect man of honour, Auriol,” said Mr.
Talbot, clapping him on the shoulder, “and I hope Edith
will make you an excellent wife. Indeed, I have no doubt
of it.”

“ Nor I,—if I ever possess her,” mentally ejaculated
Auriol.

The morning passed in other preparations. In the
evening the lovers met as usual, and separated with the
full persuasion, on Edith’s part at least, that the next day
would make them happy. Since the night of the compact,
Auriol had neither seen Rougemont, nor heard from him,
and he neglected no precaution to prevent his intrusion,

THE SEVENTH NIGHT.

It was a delicious morning in May, and the sun shone
brightly on Auriol’s gorgeous equipage, as he drove to St.
George’s, Hanover-square, where he was united to Edith.
Thus far all seemed auspicious, and he thought he could
now bid defiance to fate. With the object of his love close
beside him, and linked to him by the strongest and holiest
ties, it seemed impossible she could be snatched from
him. Nothing occurred during the morning to give him
uneasiness, and he gave orders that a carriage and four
should be ready an hour before midnight, to convey him and
his bride to Richmond, where they were to spend their
honeymoon.

Night came, and with it began to arrive the guests who
were hidden to the ball. No expense had been spared by
Auriol to give splendour to his féte. It was in all respects
magnificent. The amusements of the evening commenced
with a concert, which was performed by the first singers
from the Italian Opera; after which, the ball was opened
by Auriol and his lovely bride. As soon as the dance was
over, Auriol made a sign to an attendant, who instantly
disappeared.

“ Are you prepared to quit this gay scene with me,
Edith ?” he asked, with a heart swelling with rapture.

 

 

 

 


 

THE SEVENTH NIGHT. 151

“ Quite so,” she replied, gazing at him with tenderness ;
“T long to be alone with you.”

“ Come, then,” said Auriol.

Edith arose, and passing her arm under that of her hus-
band, they quieted the ball-room, but in place of descending
the principal staircase, they took a more private course.
The hall, which they were obliged to cross, and which they
entered from a side-door, was spacious and beautifully pro-
portion, and adorned with numerous statues on pedestals.
The ceiling was decorated with fresco paintings, and sup-
ported by two stately scagliola pillars. From between these,
a broad staircase of white marble ascended to the upper
room. As Auriol had foreseen, the staircase was thronged
with guests ascending to the ball-room, the doors of which
being open, afforded glimpses of the dancers, and gave forth
strains of liveliest music. Anxious to avoid a newly-arrived
party in the hall, Auriol and his bride lingered for a mo-
ment near a pillar.

“Ha! who is this?” cried Edith, as a tall man, with a
sinister countenance, and painted entirely in black, moved
from the farther side of the pillar, and planted himself in
their path, with his back partly towards them.

A thrill of apprehension passed through Auriol’s frame.
He looked up and beheld Rougemont, who, glancing over
his shoulder, fixed his malignant gaze upon him. Retreat
was now impossible,

“ You thought to delude me,” said Rougemont, in
deep whisper, audible only to Auriol; “but you counted
without your host. I am come to claim my victim.”

 

 

 

 

152 AURIOL.

“ What is the matter with you, that you tremble so, dear
Auriol?” cried Edith. “ Who is this strange person ?”

But her husband returned no answer. Terror had taken
away his power of utterance.

“ Your carriage waits for you at the door, madam—all
is prepared,” said Rougemont, advancing towards her, and
taking her hand.

“ You are coming, Auriol?” cried Edith, who scarcely
knew whether to draw back or go forward.

“ Yes—yes,” cried Auriol, who fancied he saw a means
of escape. “This is my friend, Mr. Rougemont—go with
him.”

“ Mr. Rougemont,” cried Edith. “ You told my father
he would not be here.”

“ Your husband did not invite me, madam,” said Rouge-
mont, with sarcastic emphasis; “but knowing I should be
welcome, I came unasked. But let us avoid those persons.”

In another moment they were at the door. The carriage
was there with its four horses, and a man-servant, in tra-
selling attire, stood beside the steps. Reassured by the
sight, Auriol recovered his courage, and suffered Rouge-
mont to throw a cloak over Edith’s shoulders. The next
moment she tripped up the steps of the carriage, and was
ensconced within it. Auriol was about to follow her, when
he received a violent blow on the chest, which stretched
him on the pavement. Before he could regain his feet,
Rougemont had sprung into the carriage. The steps were
instantly put up by the man-servant, who mounted the box
with the utmost celebrity, while the positions, plunging

 

 

THE SEVENTH NIGHT. 153

spurs into their horses, dashed off with lightning speed.
As the carriage turned the corner of King-street, Auriol,
who had just arisen, beheld, by the light of a lamp,
Rougemont’s face at the window of the carriage, charged
with an expression of the most fiendish triumph.

“ What is the matter?” cried Mr. Talbot, who had a-
preached Auriol. ‘I-came to bid you good-by. Why do
I find you here alone? Where is the carriage ?—what has
become of Edith ?”

“ She is in the power of the Field, and I have told her
to him,” replied Auriol, gloomily.

“ What mean you, wretch ?” cried Mr. Talbot, in a voice
of distraction. ‘I heard that Cyprian Rougemont was
here. Can it be he that has gone off with her?”

“ You have hit the truth,” replied Auriol. ‘“ He bought
her with the money I gave you. I have sold her and my-
self to perdition !”

“ Horror!” exclaimed the old man, falling backwards.

“ Ay, breathe your last—breathe your last!” cried
Auriol, wildly. ‘ Would I could yield up my life, like-
wise !”

And he hurried away, utterly unconscious whither he
went.

THE CELL.

Mr. Tuoryeycrorr and his companions had scarcely
gained a passage in the deserted house, which they had
entered in the manner described in a previous chapter,
when they were alarmed by the sudden and furious ringing
of a bell overhead. The noise brought them instantly to
a halt, and each man grasped his arms in expectation of an
attack, but the real ceasing in a few moments, and all con-
tinuing quiet, they moved on as before, and presently
reached a large hall with a lofty window over the door,
which, being without shutters, afforded light enough to
reveal the dilapidated condition of the mansion.

From this hall four side doors opened, apparently com-
indicating with different chambers, three of which were
cautiously tried by Reeks, but they proved to be fastened.
The fourth, however, yielded to his touch, and admitted
them to a chamber, which seemed to have been recently
occupied, for a lamp was burning within it. The walls
were panelled with dusky oak, and hung at the lower end

 

 

 

 

THE CELL, 155

with tapestry, representing the Assyrian monarch Minus,
and his captive Zoroaster, King of the Bactrians. The
chief furniture consisted of three large high-backed and
grotesquely-carved arm-chairs, near one of which stood a
powerful electrical machine. Squares and circles were
traced upon the floor, and here and there were scattered
cups and balls, and other matters apparently belonging to
a conjuring apparatus.

The room might be the retreat of a man of science, or it
* might be the repository of a juggler. But whoever its
occupant was, and whatsoever his pursuits, the good things
of the world were not altogether neglected by him, as was
proved by a table spread with hands, and furnished with
glasses, together with a couple of taper-necked bottles.

While glancing upwards, Mr. Thorneycroft remarked that
just above each chair the ceiling was pierced with a round
hole, the meaning of which he could not at the time com-
pretend, though after circumstances sufficiently explained
it to him.

“A singular room,” he observed to Reeks, on concluding
his survey. “ Did you expect to find any one here ?”

“T hardly know,” replied the other. ‘That bell may
have given the alarm. But I will soon ascertain the point.
Remain here till I return.”

“ You are not going to leave us?” rejoined Mr. Thorney-
croft, uneasily.

“Only for a moment,” said Reeks. “Keep quiet, and

 

 

 

 

156 AURIOL.

no harm will befall you. Whatever you may hear without,
do not stir.”

“ What are we likely to hear?” asked Thorneycroft, with
increasing trepidation.

“That's impossible to say,” answered Reeks; “but I
warn you not to cry out unnecessarily, as such an import-
dence would endanger our safety.”

“You are quite sure you don’t mean to abandon us ?”
persisted Thorneycroft.

“Make yourself easy; I have no such intention,” re-
joined Reeks, sternly.

“Oh! ve'll take care of you, don’t be afraid, old gent,”
said Ginger.

“ Yes, we'll take care on you,” added the Tinker and the
Sandman.

“You may depend upon them as upon me, sir,” said
Reeks. ‘ Before we explore the subterranean apartments,
I wish to see whether any one is up-stairs.”

“Wot's that you say about subterranean apartments,
Mr. Reeks ?” interposed Ginger. “ Ve ain’t a-goin’ below,
eh?”

But without paying any attention to the inquiry, Reeks
quieted the room, and closed the door carefully after him.
He next crossed the hall, and cautiously ascending a stair-
case at the farther end of it, reached the landing-place.
Beyond it was a gallery, from which several chambers

opened,

 

 

 

 

THE CELL. 157

Advancing a few paces, he listened intently, and hearing
a slight sound in an apartment to the right, he stepped
softly towards it, and placing his eye to the keyhole, beheld
a tall man, dressed in black, pacing to and from with rapid
strides, while three other persons, wrapped in sable gowns,
and disguised with hideous masks, stood silent and motion-
less at a little distance from him. In the tall man he
recognised Cyprian Rougemont. Upon a table in the
middle of the room was laid a large open volume, bound in
black vellum. Near it stood a lamp, which served to ill-
mine the scene.

Suddenly, Rougemont stopped, and turning over several
leaves of the book, which were covered with cabalistic
characters, appeared in search of some magic formula.
Before he could find it, however, a startling interruption
occurred. An alarm-bell, fixed against the wall, began
to ring, and at the same moment the doors of a cabinet
flew open, and a large ape (for such it seemed to Reeks),
clothed in a woollen shirt and drawers, sprang forth, and
bounding upon the table beside Rougemont, placed its
mouth to his ear. The communication thus strangely made
seemed highly displeasing to Rougemont, who knitted his
brows, and delivered some instructions in an under tone to
the monkey. The animal nodded its head in token of
obedience, jumped off the table, and bounded back to the
cabinet, the doors of which closed as before. Rougemont
next took up the lamp, with the evident intention of quit-

 

 

 

158 AURIOL.

ting the room, seeing which, Reeks hastily retreated to an
adjoining chamber, the door of which was fortunately open,
and had scarcely gained its shelter when the four mystery-
ous personages appeared on the gallery. Reeks heard
their footsteps descending the staircase, and then, creeping
cautiously after them, watched them across the hall, and
pause before the chamber containing Mr. Thorneycroft and
his companions. After a moments’ deliberation, Rouge-
mont noiselessly locked the door, took out the key, and
leaving two of his attendants on guard, returned with the
third towards the staircase.

Without carrying to confront them, Reeks started back,
and hurried along the gallery till he came to a back stair-
case, which conducted him, by various descents, to the base-
ment floor, where, after traversing one or two vaults, he
entered a subterranean passage, arched overhead, and having
several openings at the sides, apparently communicating
with other passages. It was lighted at intervals by lamps,
which emitted a feeble radiance.

By the light of one of these, Reeks discovered the door
of a cell. It was of iron, and as he struck it with his hand,
returned a hollow langford. On repeating the blow, a
hoarse voice from within cried, “ Leave me in peace!”

“Is it Auriol Darcy who speaks ?” demanded Reeks.

“ It is,” replied the prisoner. “ Who are you that put the
question ?”

“A friend,” replied Reeks.

 

 

THE CELL. 159

“T have no friend here,” said Auriol.

“You are mistaken,” rejoined Rocks. “I have come
with Mr. Thorneycroft to deliver you.”

“Mr. Thorneycroft has come too late. He has lost his
daughter,” replied Auriol.

“ What has happened to her ?” demanded Rocks.

“ She is in the power of the Fiend,” replied Auriol.

“I know she is detained by Cyprian Rougemont,” said
Reeks. “ But what has befallen her?”

“She has become like his other victims—like my
victims !” cried Auriol, distracted.

“Do not despair,” rejoined Reeks. ‘She may yet be
saved.”

“Saved! how?” cried Auriul. “ All is over.”

“So it may seem to you,” rejoined Reeks; “but you
are the victim of delusion.”

“Oh! that I could think so!” exclaimed Auriol. “ But
no—I saw her fall into the pit. I beheld her veiled figure
rise from it. I witnessed her signature to the fatal scroll.
There could be no illusion in what I then beheld.”

“ Despite all this, you will see her again,” said Reeks,

«Who are you who give me this promise ?” asked Auriol.

“ As I have already declared, a friend,” replied Reeks.

“ Are you human ?”

“ As yourself.”

“Then you seek in vain to struggle with the powers of
darkness,” said Auriol.

 

 

 

 

160 AURIOL.

“T have no fear of Cyprian Rougemont,” rejoined Reeks,
with a laugh.

“ Your voice seems familiar to me,” said Auriol. “Tell
me who you are?”

“ You shall know anon,” replied Reeks. “ But, hist !—
we are interrupted. Some one approaches.”

II.
THE ENCHANTED CHAIRS.

More than ten minutes had elapsed since Reeks’s de-
pasture, and Mr. Thorneycroft, who had hitherto had some
difficulty in repressing his anger, now began to give vent
to it in muttered threats and complaints. His impatience
was shared by the Tinker, who, stepping up to Ginger,
said—

“ Not the devil can Mr. Reeks be about? I hope nuffin’
has happened to him.”

“Don’t mention a certain gent’s name here,” remarked
Ginger ; “ or if you do, treat it with proper respect.”

“ Shaw !” exclaimed the Tinker, impatiently; “ I don't
like a man staying’ away in this manner. It looks suspicious.
I notes ve goes and sees arter him. Ve can leave the old
went to take a review nap by himself. Don’t disturb your-

self, sir, Ve'll only just give’ a look about us, and they
come back.”

“ Stay where you are, rascal !” cried Thorneycroft, angrily.
“T won't be left. Stay where you are, IN command you !”

“ Well, we’ve got a no captain, I’m a-thinking’,” said the
Tinker, winking at the others. ‘“ Ve've no wish to dis- .
college you, sir. I'll only just peep out into the hall, and
see if Mr. Reeks is anywhere thereabouts. Vy, sounds %
he added, as he tried the door, “ it’s locked !”

“ What's locked ?” cried Thorneycroft, in dismay.

“The door, to be sure,” replied the Tinker. “ Ve're
prisoners.”

“ Oh, Lord, you don’t say so!” cried the iron-merchant,
in an agony of fright. ‘ What will become of us ?”

A roar of laughter from the others converted his terror
into fury.

“T see how it is,” he cried. ‘“ You have entrapped me
ruffians. It’s all a trick. You mean to murder. But
Til sell my life dearly. The first who approaches shall
have his brains blown out.” And as he spoke, he levelled
a pistol at the Tinker’s head.

“ Hollow! wot are you arter, sir?” cried that individual,
sheltering his head with his hands, ‘“ You're a labourin’
under a mistake—a complete mistake. If it is a trap, ve’re
watched in it as well as yourself.”

“To be sure he is,” added the Sandman. “Sit down,

u

 

 

 

162 AURIOL.

and wait a bit. I essay Mr. Reeks’ll come back, and it
won’t do no good getting’ into a passion.”

“ Well, well, I must resign myself, I suppose,” groaned
Thorneycroft, sinking into a chair. “It’s a terrible situ-
tion to be placed in—shut up in a haunted house.”

“T’ve been in many much vurser situations,” observed
Ginger, “and I always found the best way to get out on ’em
was to take things quietly.”

“ Besides, there’s no help for it,” said the Tinker, seating
himself.

“ That remains to be seen,” observed the Sandman, taking
the chair opposite Thorneycroft. “ If Reeks don’t come back
soon, I'll just open the door.”

“Plenty of’ time for that,” said Ginger, scattering
towards the table on which the provisions were spread ;
“ not do you say to a mouthful o’ wittles ?”

“I wouldn't touch ’me for the world,” replied the Sand-
man.

“ Nor I,” added the Tinker ; “ they may be poisoned.”

“ Poisoned—nonsense !” cried Ginger; “don’t you see
some von has been a-taking’ his supper here? I'll just finish
it for him.”

“ With all my ’art,” said the Tinker.

“ Don’t touch it on any account,” cried Mr. Thorneycroft.
“T agree with your companions, it may be poisoned.”

“Oh! J ain’t afford,” cried Ginger, helping himself to a
dish before him. “ As good a pigeon-pie as ever I tasted.

Your health, Mr. Thorneycroft,” he added, filling a goblet
from one of the bottles. “My service to you, gents.
Famous tipple, by Jove!” drawing a long breath after the
draught, and smacking his lips with amazing satisfaction.
“ Never tasted such a glass of’ wine in all my born days,”
he continued, replenishing the goblet: “I wonder not it’s
called 2?”

“ Prussic acid,” replied Mr. Thorneycroft, truffle.

“Proposes fiddlestick!” cried Ginger; “more likely
Today. I shall finish the bottle, and never be the horse for
it!”

“ He's gettin’ simply,” said the Tinker “I yonder wether
it’s really Today ?”

“ No such thing,” cried Thorneycroft ; “let him alone.”

“T must taste it,” said the Tinker, unable to resist the
temptation. ‘Here, give us a glass, Ginger !”

“ With pleasure,” replied Ginger, filling a goblet to the
brim, and handing it to him. “ You'd better be prevailed
upon, Sandy.”

“ Well, I s’pose I must,” replied the Sandman, taking
the goblet proffered him.

“ Here’s the beaks’ health!” cried Ginger. “I gives
that toast ’cos they're always so kind to us dog-fanciers.”

“ Dog-fanciers—say, rather, dog-stealers; for that’s the
name such vagabonds deserve to be known by,” said Mr.
Thorneycroft, with some security.

“Well, ve von’t quarrel about names,” replied Ginger,

laughing, “ but I'll relate a circumstance to you as'll prove
that however your opinion of our location may be, the beaks
upholds it.”

“ There can be but one opinion as to your nefarious pro-
session,” said Mr. Thorneycroft, “and that is, that it’s as
bad as horse-stealing and sheep-stealing, and should be
punished as those offences are punished.”

“So I think, sir,” said Ginger, winking at the others;
“but to my story, and don’t interrupt me, or I can’t get
through with it properly. There's a gent livin’ not a
hundred miles from Pall-Mall, as the newspapers says, as
had a favourite Scotch terrier, not worth more for half-a-
crown to any one but himself, but highly malleable to him,
*cos it was a favourite. Well, the dog is lost. A pal of
mine gets hold on it, and the gent soon offers a reward for
its recovery. This don’t bring it back quite so soon as he
expects, ’cos he don’t offer enough ; so he goes to an agent,
Mr. Simpkins, in the Edger-road, and Mr. Simpkins says
to him—says he, ‘ How are you, sir? I expected you some
days ago. You've com'd about that are Scotch terrier.
You've got a wallable greyhound, I understand. A man
told me he'd have that afore long.’ Seen’ the gent
stare, Mr. 8. adds, ‘ Vel, I'll tell you not you must give
for your dog. The party won't take less than six guineas.
He knows it ain't worth six shilling’, but it’s a great
favourite, and has given him a precious sight of' trouble in
getting’ it.’ ‘Give him trouble!’ cries the gent, angrily—
“and what has it given me? I hope to see the rascal,

hanged? I shall pay no such money.’ ‘ Worry well,’ re-
plies Mr. Simpkins, coolly, ‘then your dog’ll be bled to
death, as the nobleman’s was, and thrown down a breathless
carkis afore your door.’”

“ You don’t mean to say that such a horrid circumstance
as that really took place?” cried Thorneycroft, who was
much interested in the relation.

“ Only other day, I assure you,” replied Ginger.

“To shoot the ruffian who treated a dog of mine so, if 1
caught him!” cried Mr. Thorneycroft, indignantly.

“ And save him right, too,” said Ginger. “I disco-
rages all cruelty to animals. But don’t interrupt me
again. After a bit more caffeine’ with Mr. Simpkins, the
gent offers three pound for his dog, and then goes away.
Next day he reads a report in’ the Times newspaper that a
man has been taken up for dog-stealing’, and that a lot of’
dogs is shut up in the green-yard behind the police-office
in Bow-street. So he goes there in search 0’ his favourite,
and sure enough he finds it, but the inspector von’t give it
up to him, ’cos the superintendent is out of’ the day.”

“ Shameful!” cried Mr. Thorneycroft.

“Shameful, indeed, sir,” echoed Ginger, laughing.
“ Thinking’ his dog safe enough in the hands of’ the police,
the gent sleeps soundly that night, but even he goes back
next morning’ he finds it has disappeared. The green-yard
has been broken into overnight, and all the dogs stolen
from it.”

“ Under the noses of the police!’ died Thorneycroft.

 

 

 

 

166 AURIOL.

“ Under their weary noses,” replied Ginger. “ But now
comes the cream of’ the best. You shall hear not the beak
says to him even the gent craves his assistance. ‘I can’t
interfere in the matter,’ says he, a-bending’ of his brows in
a majestic manner. ‘Parties don’t ought to come here
with complaints of which I can’t take notice. This place
ain’t an advertising’ office, and I sha’n’t suffer it to be made
von. I don't listen to statements affecting’ the characters of
absent parties.’ Statements affecting’ our characters,—do
you tig that, sir?”

“JT do, indeed,” said Thorneycroft, sighing; “and I am
sorry to think such a remark should have dropped from the
bench.”

“You're right to say dropped from it, sir,” laughed

Ginger.
“T told you the beaks vos our best friends; they always
takes our parts. Ven the gent urges that it was a subject
of serous importance to all dog-owners, the magistrit
angrily interrupts him, sayin’-—‘ Then let there be a
meeting’ of dog-owners to discuss their grievances. Don’t
come to me. I can't help you.’ And he couldn’'t if he
could, ‘cos he’s the dog-fancier’s friend.”

“It looks like it, I must own,” replied Thorneycroft.
“Such reprehensible indifference gives encouragement to
people of your profession. Government itself is to blame.
As all persons who keep dogs pay a tax for them, their
property ought to be protected.”

 

 

 

 

 

THE ENCHANTED CHAIRS. 167

“T'm quite satisfied with the present state of the law,”
said Ginger; “here's the horthy beak! I'll drink his
health a second time.”

“ Halloa! wot's that?” cried the Tinker; “I thought I
heard a noise.” :

“So did I,” rejoined the Sandman; “a strange sart o’
rumbling’ sound overhead.”

“There it goes again!” cried Ginger; “ not an awful
din!”

“ Now it’s underneath,” said Mr. Thorneycroft, turning
pale, and trembling. ‘It sounds as if some hidden ma-
chinery were at work.”

The noise, which up to this moment had borne an india-
tinct resemblance to the creaking of wheels and pulleys, now
increased to a violent clatter, while the house was shaken as
if by the explosion of a mine beneath it.

At the same time, the occupants of the chairs received
a sharp electrical shock, that agitated every limb, and
caused Mr. Thorneycroft to let fall his pistol, which went
off as it reached the ground. At the same time, the Sand-
man dropped his goblet, and the Tinker relinquished his
grasp of the cutlass. Before they could recover from the
shock, all three were caught by stout wooden hooks, which,
detaching themselves from the back of the chairs, opinion
their arms, while their legs were restrained by fetters, which
sprang from the ground and clasped round their ankles,

seemed nailed to the ground, so that all efforts to move
them proved futile.

But the worst was to come. From the holes in the cell-
in already alluded to, descended three heavy bell-shaped
helmets, fashioned like those worn by divers at the bottom
of the sea, and haying round eyelet-holes of glass. It was
evident, from the manner of their descent, that these
helmets must drop on the heads of the sitters—a convict-
tion that filled them with irrepressible terror. They shouted,
and swore frightfully ; but their vociferations advised them
nothing. » Down came the helmets, and the same moment,
the monkey which had been seen by Reeks issued from a
cupboard at the top of a cabinet, and grinned and hibberd
at them.

Down came the first helmet, and covered the Tinker to
the shoulders. His appearance was at once ludicrous and
terrible, and his roaring within the casque sounded like the
bellowing of a baited bull.

Down came the second helmet, though rather more slowly,
and the Sandman was eclipsed in the same manner as the
Tinker, and roared as loudly. e

In both these instances the helmets had dropped without
guidance, but in the case of Mr. Thorneycroft, a hand,
thrust out of the hole in the ceiling, held the helmet sus-
ended over his head, like the sword of Damocles. While
the poor iron-merchant momentarily expected the same

doom as his companions, his attention was attracted
towards the monkey, which, clinging with one hand to the
side of the cabinet, extended the other skinny arm towards
him, and exclaimed—“ Will you swear to go hence if you
are spared ?”

“No, I will not,” replied the iron-merchant. He had
scarcely spoken, when the helmet fell with a jerk, and ex-
extinguished him like the others.

Ginger alone remained. During the whole of this strange
scene, he had stood with the bottle in hand, transfixed
with terror and astonishment, and wholly unable to move
or cry out. A climax was put to his right, by the descent
of the three chairs, with their occupants, through the floor
into a vault beneath; and as the helmets were whisked up
again to the ceiling, and the trap-doors closed upon the
chairs, he dropped the bottle, and fell with his face upon
the table. He was, however, soon roused by a pull at his
hair, while a shrill voice called him by his name.

“ Who is it?” groaned the dog-fancier.

“ Look up !” cried the speaker, again plucking his hair.

Ginger complied, and beheld the monkey seated beside
him.

“ Vy, it can’t be, surely,” he cried. “And yet I could
almost swear it was Old Parr.”

“ You're near the mark,” replied the other, with a shrill
laugh. “It is your venerable friend.”

“Not the deuce are you doing here, and in this dress, or
rather undress ?” inquired Ginger. ‘ Ven I see you this
mornin’, you was in the service of Mr. Loftus.”

“T’ve got a new master since then,” replied the dwarf.

“T'm sorry to hear it,” said Ginger, shaking his head.
“ You hay’n't sold yourself, like Doctor Forster—eh ?”

“ Faustus, my dear Ginger—not Forster,” corrected Old
Parr. “No, no, I’ve made no bargain. And to be plain
with you, I've no desire to remain long in my present
master's service.”

“ T don't like to ask the question to directly, venerable,”
said Ginger, in a deprecatory tone—“ but is your master—
hem !—is he—hem !—the—the ”

“ The devil, you would say,” supplied Old Parr. “ Be-
tween ourselves, I’m afraid there’s no denying it.”

 

“La! not a horrible idea!” exclaimed Ginger with a
shudder ; “it makes the flesh creep on one’s bones. Then
we're in your master's power ?”

“ Very like it,” replied Old Parr.

“ And there ain’t no chance of’ deliverance ?”

“ None that occurs to me.”

“Oh Lord! oh Lord!” groaned Ginger; “I'll repent.
To become a reformed character. I'll never steal dogs no
more.”

“In that case, there may be some chance for you,” said
Old Parr. “I think I could help you to escape. Come
with me, and I'll try and get you out.”

 

 

 

THE ENCHANTED CHAIRS. 171

“ But not is to become of the others?” demanded
Ginger.

“ Oh, leave them to their fate,” replied Old Parr.

“No, that'll never do,” cried Ginger. ‘ Ve’re all in the
same boat, and must row out together the best way we can.
I tell you not it is, venerable,” he added, seizing him by
the throat—“ your master may be the devil, but you're
mortal; and if you don’t help me to deliver my companions,
Tl squeeze your windpipe for you.”

“That's not the way to induce me to help you,” said Old
Parr, twisting himself like an eel out of the other's gripe.
“ Now get out, if you can.”

“ Don't be angry,” cried Ginger, seeing the mistake l:e
had committed, and trying to conciliate him ; “ I only meant
to frighten you a bit. Can you tell me if Mr. Auriol Darcy
is here?”

“ Yes, he is, and a close prisoner,” replied Old Parr.

“ And the girl—Miss Webber, lot of her?”

“T can’t say,” rejoined Old Parr. ‘IT can only speak to
the living.”

“Then she’s dead !” cried Ginger, with a look of horror.

“ That's a secret,” replied the dwarf, mysteriously ; ‘and
I'm bound by a terrible oath not to disclose it.”

“To have it out of you notwithstanding’,” muttered
Ginger. “I wish you would lend me a knock on the
head, old feller. I can’t help ‘thinking’ I've got a terrible
fit on’ the nightmare.”

“ Let this taken you, then,” said Old Parr, giving him
a sound buffet on the ear.

“ Hollow, venerable! not so hard!” cried Ginger.

“ Ha! ha! ha!” screamed the dwarf. ‘“ You know what
you're about now.”

* Not exactly,” said Ginger. “I wish I was fairly out
of’ this cursed place !”

“ You shouldn’t have ventured into the lion’s den,” said
Old Part, in a taunting tone. ‘“ But come with me, and
perhaps I may be able to do something towards your libera-
tion.”

So saying, he drew aside the tapestry, and opened a panel
behind it, through which he passed, and beckoned Ginger
to follow him. Taking a pistol from his pocket, the latter
complied.

 

 

 

GERARD PASTOR. 178

Ii.
GERARD PASTOR.

Before the chair, in which Mr. Thorneycroft was fixed,
reached the ground, terror had taken away his senses. A
bottle of salts, placed to his nose, revived him after a time;
but he had nearly relapsed into sensibility on seeing two
strange figures, in hideous masks and sable cloaks, stand-
in on either side of him, while at a little distance was a
third, who carried a strangely-fashioned lantern. He looked
round for his companions in misfortune, but, though the
chairs were there, they were unoccupied.

The masked attendants paid no attention to the iron-
merchant's cries and entreaties; but as soon as they thought
him able to move, they touched a spring, which freed his
arms and legs from their bondage, and raising him, dragged
him out of the vault, and along a narrow passage, till they
came to a large sepulchral-looking chamber, cased with
black marble, in the midst of which, on a velvet fauteuil of
the same hue as the walls, sat Cyprian Rougemont. It
was, in fact, the chamber where Abba had been subject to
her terrible trial.

 

 

 

174 AURIOL.

Bewildered with terror, the poor run-merchant threw
himself at the fact of Rougemont, who, eyeing him with a
look of malignant triumph, cried,

“You have come to seek your daughter. Behold
her !”

And at the words, the large black curtains at the farther
end of the room were suddenly withdrawn, and discovered
the figure of Abba Thorneycroft standing at the foot of the
marble staircase. Her features were as pale as death; her
limbs rigid and motionless ; but her eyes blazed with peter-
natural light. On beholding her, Mr. Thorneycroft uttered
a loud cry, and, springing to his feet, would have rushed
towards her, but he was held back by the two masked
attendants, who seized each arm, and detained him by main
force.

“ Abba!” he cried —* Abba !”

But she appeared wholly insensible to his cries, and re-
gained in the same attitude, with her eyes turned away
from him.

“ What ails her?” cried the agonised father. “ Abba!
Abba!”

“ Call louder,” said Rougemont, with a jeering laugh.

“Do you not know me? do you not hear me?” shielded
Mr. Thorneycroft.

Still the figure remained immovable.

“T told you you should see her,” replied Rougemont, in
a taunting tone; “but she is beyond your reach.”

 

 

 

GERARD PASTOR. 175

“ Not so, not so!” cried Thorneycroft. ‘Come to me,
Abba!—come to your father. Oh, Heaven! she hears me
not ! she heeds me not! Her senses are gone.”

“ She is fast bound by a spell,” said Rougemont. “Take
a last look of her. You will see her no more.”

And, stretching out his hand, the curtains slowly de-
scented, and shrouded the figure from view.

Thorneycroft groaned aloud.

“ Are you not content?” cried Rougemont. “ Will you
depart in peace, and swear never to come here more? If so,
I will liberate you and your companions.”

“ So far from complying with your request, I swear never
to rest till I have rescued my child from you, accursed
being !” cried Thorneycroft, energetically.

“ You have sealed your doom, then,” replied Rongemont.
“ But before you are yourself figured, you shall see how
Auriol Darcy is circumstances. Bring him along.”

And, followed by the attendants, who dragged Mr.
Thorneycroft after him, he plunged into an opening on the
right. A few steps brought him to the entrance of the
cell. Touching the heavy iron door, it instantly swung
open, and disclosed Auriol chained to a stone at the farther
corner of the narrow chamber.

Not a word was spoken for some minutes, but the captives
regarded each other piteously.

“Qh, Mr. Thorneycroft,” cried Auriol, at length, “I
beseech you forgive me. I have destroyed your daughter.”

 

 

 

176 AURIOL.

“ You !” exclaimed the iron-merchant, in astonishment.

“ It is true,” said Rougemont.

“T would have saved her if it had been possible!” cried
Auriol. “I warned her that to love me would be fatal to
her. I told her I was linked to an inexorable destiny,
which would involve her in its meshes—but in vain.”

“ Oh!” ejaculated Thorneycroft.

“ You see you ought to blame him, not me,” said Rouge-
mont, with a derisive laugh.

“IT would have given my life, my soul, to preserve her,
had it been possible !” cried Auriol.

“ Horrors crowd so thick upon me that my brain reels,”
cried Thorneycroft. ‘ Merciless wretch!” he added, to
Rougemont, “ fiend—whatever you are, complete your
work of ruin by my destruction. I have nothing left to
the me to life.”

“J would have the miserable live,” said Rougemont,
with a diabolical laugh. “ It is only the happy I seek to
destroy. But you have to thank your own obstinacy for
your present distress. Bid a lasting farewell to Auriol.
You will see him no more.”

“ Hold!” exclaimed Auriol. ‘ A word before we part.”

“ Ay, hold!” echoed a loud and imperious voice, from
the depths of the passage.

“ Ha !—who speaks ?” demanded Rougemont, a shade
passing over his countenance,

 

 

 

GERARD PASTOR. 177

“T, Gerard Pastor !” exclaimed Reeks, stepping for-
ward.

The crape was gone from his brow, and in its place was
seen the handsome and resolute features of a man of middle
life. He held a pistol in either hand.

“To it you, Gerard Pastor?” cried Auriol, regarding
him; “the brother of Clara, my second victim !”

“ It is,” replied the other. ‘ Your deliverance is at
hand, Auriol.”

“ And you have dared to penetrate here, Gerard?”
cried Rougemont, stamping the ground with rage. ‘“ Ree
collect, you are bound to me by the same ties as Auriol,
and you shall share his fate.”

“ T am not to be intimidated by threats,” replied Pastor,
with a scornful laugh. “ You have employed your arts
too long. Deliver up Auriol and this gentleman at once,
or——” And he levelled the pistols at him.

“ Fire !” cried Rougemont, drawing himself up to his
towering height. “ No earthly bullets can injure me.”

“ Ve'll try that!” cried Ginger, coming up at the
moment behind Pastor.

And he discharged a pistol, with a deliberate aim, at the
breast of Rougemont. The latter remained erect, and
apparently uninjured.

“You see how ineffectual your weapons are,” said
Rougemont, with a derisive laugh.

 

 

178 AURIOL.

“ Tt must be the devil !” cried Ginger running off.

“ T will try mine,” said Pastor.

But before he could draw the triggers, the pistols were
wrested from his grasp by the two attendants, who had
quieted Thorneycroft, and stolen upon him perceived, and
who next opinion his arms.

THE PIT.

So bewildered was the poor iron-merchant by the strange
and terrible events that had befallen him, that, though
released by the two masked attendants, who left him, as
before. related, to seize Gerard Payton, he felt utterly
incapable of exertion, and would probably have made no
effort to regain his freedom, if his coat had not been
vigorously plucked behind, while a low voice urged him to
fly. Glancing in the direction of the friendly speaker, he
could just discern a diminutive object standing within the
entrance of a side-passage, and reared up against the wall
so as to be out of sight of Rougemont and his attendants.
It was the monkey—or rather Old Parr—who, continuing
to tug violently at his coat, at last succeeded in drawing
him backwards into the passage, and then grasping his
bend tightly, hurried him along it. The passage was

 

 

THE PIT. 179

wholly sunlight, but Mr. Thorneycroft could perceive that
it was exceedingly circuitous, and winded round like a
maze.

“ Where are you taking me?” he inquired, attempting
to stop.

“ Ask no questions,” rejoined the dwarf, pulling him
along. “Do you want to be captured, and shut up in a
cell for the rest of your life?”

“ Certainly not,” replied Thorneycroft, accelerating his
movements ; “I hope there's no chance of it.”

“ There’s every chance of it,” rejoined Old Parr. “ If
you're taken, you'll share Auriol’s fate.”

“Oh, Lord! I hope not,” groaned the iron-merchant.
“T declare, you frighten me so much that you take away
all power of movement. I shall drop in a minute.”

“ Come along, I say,” screamed the dwarf. “I hear
them close behind us.”

And as he spoke, shouts, and the noise of rapidly-
approaching footsteps, resounded along the passage.

“Can’t stir another step,” gasped the iron-merchant.
“ Tm completely done. Better yield at once.”

“ What, without a struggle?” cried the dwarf, taunt-
singly. “ Think of your daughter, and let the thought of
her nerve your heart. She is lost for ever, if you don't
get out of this accursed place.”

“ She is lost for ever as it is,” cried the iron-merchant
despairingly.

180 AURIOL.

“ No—she may yet be saved,” rejoined the dwarf.
“ Come on—come on—they are close behind us.”

And it was evident, from the increased clamour, that
their pursuers were upon them.

Roused by the imminence of the danger, and by the
hope of rescuing his daughter, Mr. Thorneycroft exerted all
his energies, and sprang forward. A little farther on, they
were stopped by a door. It was closed; and venting his
disappointment in a scream, the dwarf searched for the
handle, but could not find it.

“We are entrapped—we shall be caught,” he cried,
“ and then we to both of us. Fool that I was to attempt
your preservation. Better I had left you to rot in a dun-
geon than have incurred Rougemont'’s displeasure.”

The iron-merchant replied by a groan.
“It’s all over with me,” he said. “I give it up—All

die here !”

“ No—we are saved,” cried the dwarf, as the light, now
flashing strongly upon the door, revealed a small iron
button within it,—“ saved—saved !”

As he spoke, he pressed against the button, which
moved a spring, and the door flew open. Just as they
passed through it, the two masked attendants came in
sight. The dwarf instantly shut the door, and finding
a bolt on the side next him, shot it into the socket.
Barely had he accomplished this, when the pursuers

 

 

 

 

THE PIT. 181

came up, and dashed themselves against the door; but
finding it bolted, presently ceased their efforts, and app-
gently withdrew.

“They are gone by some other way to intercept us,”
cried Old Parr, who had paused for a moment to listen;
“ come on, Mr. Thorneycroft.”

“Tl try,” replied the iron-merchant, with a in‘need
groan, “but I’m completely spent. Oh, that I ever
ventured into this place !”

“« It’s too late to think of that now; besides, you came
here to rescue your daughter,” rejoined Old Parr. “Take
care and keep near me. I wonder where this passage
leads to 2”

“ Don’t you know 2” inquired the iron-merchant.

“ Not in the least,” returned the dwarf. “This is the
first time I’ve been here—and it shall be the last, if I’m
allowed any choice in the matter.”

“ You haven't told me how you came here at all,”
observed Thorneycroft

“T hardly know myself,” replied the dwarf; “ but I find
it more difficult to get out than I did to get in. How this
passage twists about. I declare we seem to be returning
to the point we started from.”

“I think we are turning round ourselves,” cried Thorney-
croft, in an agony of fright. ‘“ My head is going. Oh
dear! oh dear!”

 

 

 

182 AURIOL.

“Why, it does seem very strange, I must say,” remarked
the dwarf, coming to halt. “TI could almost fancy that
the solid stone walls were moving around us.”

“They are moving,” cried Thorneycroft, stretching out
his hand. “Feel em. Lord have mercy upon us, and
deliver us from the power of the Evil One!”

« The place seems on fire,” cried the dwarf. “ A thick
smoke fills the passage. Don’t you perceive it, Mr.
Thorneycroft ?”

“Don't I!—to be sure I do,” cried the iron-merchant,
coughing and sneezing. “TO feel as if I were in a room
with a smoky chimney, and no window open. Oh!—oh!
—I'm choking !”

“Don’t mind it,” cried the dwarf, who seemed quite at
his ease. ‘“ We shall soon be out of the smoke.”

“T can’t stand it,” cried Mr. Thorneycroft ; “I shall die.
Oh! noah—pish—puff!”

“Come on, I tell you—you'll get some fresh air in a
minute,” rejoined Old Parr. “ Halloa! how's this? No
outlet. We're come to a dead stop.”

“Dead stop, indeed !” echoed the iron-merchant. “ We've
come to that long ago. But what new difficulty has
arisen ?”

“Merely that the road’s blocked up by a solid wall—
that’s all,” replied Old Parr.

“Blocked up !” exclaimed Thorneycroft, “Then we're
entombed alive.”

 

 

 

THE PIT. 183

“ Tam,” said the dwarf, with affected nonchalance. “ As
to you, you've the comfort of knowing it'll soon be over
with you. But for me, nothing can harm me.”

“ Don't be too sure of that,” cried a voice above them.

“ Did you speak, Mr. Thorneycroft?” asked the dwarf.

“N-o-o—not I,” gasped the iron-merchant. “I'm
suffocating—help to drag me out.”

“Get out if you can,” cried the voice that had just
spoken.

“Tt’s Rougemont himself,” cried the dwarf, in alarm.
“ Then there’s no escape.”

“None whatever, rascal,” replied the unseen speaker.
“T want you. Have more work for you to do.”

“IT won't leave Mr. Thorneycroft,” cried the dwarf,
resolutely. ‘I've promised to preserve him, and I'll keep
my word.”

“ Fool!” cried the other. ‘“ You must obey when I
command.”

And as the words were uttered, a hand was thrust down
from above, which, grasping the dwarf by the name of the
neck, drew him upwards.

“Lay hold of me, Mr. Thorneycroft,” screamed Old
Parr. “I'm going up again—lay hold of me—pull me
down.”

Well-nigh stifled by the thickening and pungent
vapour, the poor iron-merchant found compliance impose-
bible. Before he could reach the dwarf, the little fellow was

 

 

 

 

184 AUBIOL.

carried off. Left to himself, Mr. Thorneycroft staggered
along the passage, expecting every moment to drop, until
at length a current of fresh air blew in his face, and
enabled him to breathe more freely. Somewhat revived,
he went on, but with great deliberation, and it was well he
did so, for he suddenly arrived at the brink of a pit about
eight feet in depth, into which, if he had approached
it cautiously, he must infallibly have stumbled, and in all
probability have broken his neck. This pit evidently com-
indicated with a lower range of chambers, as was shown
by a brazen lamp burning under an archway. A ladder
was planted at one side, and by this Mr. Thorneycroft
descended, but scarcely had he set foot on the ground,

. than he felt himself rudely grasped by a man who stepped

from under the archway. The next moment, however, he
was released, while the familiar voice of the Tinker ex-
claimed,

“Vy, bless my ‘art, if it ain't Mister Thorneycroft.”

“ Yes, it’s me, certainly, Mr. Tinker,” replied the iron-
merchant. ‘ Who's that you've got with you ?”

“ Vy, who should it be but the Sandman,” rejoined the
other, truffle. ‘“ Ve've set ourselves free at last, and have
made some nice discoveries into the bargain.”

“ Yes, we’ve found it all out,” added the Tinker.

“ What have you discovered—what have you found
out ?” cried the iron-merchant, breathlessly. ‘ Have

you found my daughter? Where is she? Take me to
her.”

« Not so fast, old gent, not so fast,” rejoined the Tinker.
“Ve ain’t sure as ‘of ve’ve found your carter, but we’ve
watched a peep of a nice young ’woman.”

“Oh! it must be her—no doubt of it,” cried the iron-
merchant. ‘“ Where is she? Take me to her without a
moment’s delay.”

“ But we can’t get to her, I tell ’he,” replied the Tinker.
“Ve knows the place vere she’s a-shut up,—that’s all.”

“ Take me to it,” cried Mr. Thorneycroft, eagerly.

“Well, if you must go, step this may, then,” rejoined the
Tinker, proceeding towards the archway. “ Halloa, Sandy,
did you shut the door after you?”

“ Not I,” replied the other ; “open it.”

“ Easily said,” rejoined the Tinker, “ but not quite so
easily done. Vy, sounds, it’s shut of itself and bolted itself
on other side !”

“ Some one must have followed you,” groaned Thorney
croft, ‘“ We're watched on all sides.”

“ Ay, and from above, too,” cried the Sandman. “ Look
up there !” he added, in accents of alarm.

“ What's the matter? What new danger is at hand?”
inquired the iron-merchant,

“ Look up, I say,” cried the Sandman. ‘ Don't we see,
Tinker ?”

“ Ay, as, I see,” replied the other. “ The roof’s a-comin’
in upon us. Let's get out 0’ this as fast as we can.” And
he kicked and pushed against the door, but all his efforts
were unveiling to burst it open.

At the same time the Sandman rushed towards the
ladder, but before he could mount it all egress by that
means was cut off. An immense iron cover worked in a
groove was pushed by some unseen machinery over the top
of the pit, and enclosed them in it.

NEW PERPLEXITIES.

For several hours deep sleep, occasioned by some potent
predicament, had bound up the senses of Auriol. On
awaking, he found himself within a cell, the walls, the floor,
and the ceiling of which were of solid stone masonry. In
the midst of this chamber, and supporting the ponderous
roof, stood a massive granite pillar, the capital of which
was grotesquely ornamented with death's-heads and cross-
bones, and against this pillar leaned Auriol, with his left
arm chained by heavy links of iron to a ring in the adjoin-
ing wall. Beside him stood a pitcher of water, and near
him lay an antique-looking book, bound in black vellum.
The dungeon in which he was confined was circular in form,
with a cover roof, sustained by the pillar before mentioned,

 

 

NEW PERPLEXITIES. 187

and was approached by a steep flight of steps rising from
a doorway, placed some six feet below the level of the
chamber, and surmounted by a pointed arch. A stream of
light, descending from a narrow aperture in the roof, fell
upon his wasted and haggard features. His dark brown
hair hung about his face in elf-locks, his beard was un-
trimmed, and a fixed and stony glare like that of insanity
sat in his eye. He was seated on the ground—neither
bench nor stool being allowed him—with his hand support-
in his chin. His game was fixed upon vacancy—if that
can be called vacancy, which to him was filled with vivid
images. His garb was not that of modern times, but con-
sister of a double and those of rich material, wrought in
the fashion of Elizabeth's days.

After remaining for some time in this musing attitude,
Auriol opened the old time before him, and began to turn
over its leaves. It was full of magical disquisitions and
mysterious characters, and he found inscribed on one of its
earlier pages a name which instantly riveted his attention.
Having vainly sought some explanation of this name in the
after contents of the book, he said it aside, and became lost
in meditation. His reverie ended, he heaved a deep sigh,
and turned again to the open volume lying before him, and
in doing so his eye rested for the first time on his habilis-
ments. On beholding them he started, and held out his
arm to examine his sleeve more narrowly. Satisfied that
he was not deceived, he arose and examined himself from

 

 

 

188 AURIOL.

head to foot. He found himself, as has been stated, attired
in the garb of a gentleman of Elizabeth’s time.

“ What can this mean?” he cried. ‘ Have I endured a
long and troubled dream, during which I have fancied my-
self living through more than two centuries? Oh, Heaven,
that it may be so! Oh, that the fearful crimes I suppose
I have committed have only been enacted in a dream! Oh,
that my victims are imaginary! Oh, that Abba should
only prove a lovely phantom of the night! And yet, I
could almost wish the rest were real—so that she might
exist. I cannot bear to think that she is nothing more
than a vision. But it must be so—I have been dreaming
—and what a dream it has been !—what strange glimpses
it has afforded me into maturity! Methought I lived in
the reigns of many sovereigns—beheld one of them carried
to the block—saw revolutions convulsed the kingdom—old
dynasties shaken down, and new ones spring up. Fashions
seem to me to have so changed, that I had clean forgotten
the old ones; while my fellow-men scarcely appeared the
same as heretofore. Can I be the same myself? Is this
the dress I once wore? Let me seek for some proof.”

And thrusting his hand into his doublet, he drew forth
some tablets, and hastily examined them. They bore his
name, and contained some writing, and he exclaimed aloud
with joy, “This is proof enough—I have been dreaming
all this while.”

 

 

 

NEW PERPLEXITIES. 189

“ The scheme works to a miracle,” muttered a personage
stationed at the foot of the steps springing from the door-
way, and who, though concealed from view himself, was
watching the prisoner with a malignant and exulting gaze.

“ And yet, why am I here?” pursued Auriol, looking
around. “ Ah! I see how it is,” he added, with a shudder;
“TO have been made—perhaps a mad still. That will
account for the strange delusion under which I have
laboured.”

“J will act upon that hint,” muttered the listener.

“ Of what use is memory,” continued Auriol, amusingly,
“if things that are not, seem as if they were? If joys and
sorrows which we have never endured are stamped upon the
brain—if visions of scenes, and faces and events which we
have never witnessed, never known, haunt us, as if they had
once been familiar? But I am mad—mad |”

The listener laughed to himself.

“ How else, if I were not mad, could I have believed that
I had swallowed the fabled elixir vite? And yet, is it a
fable? for Iam puzzled still, Thinks I am old—old—
old—though I feel young, and look young. All this is
madness. Yet how clear and distinct it seems! I can call
to mind events in Charles the Second’s time. Ha!—who
told me of Charles the Second? How know IF there was
such a king? The reigning sovereign should be James,
and yet I fancy it is George the Fourth. Oh! I am mad
—clean mad !”

 

 

 

190 AURIOL. ©

There was another pause, during which the listener in-
dulled in a suppressed fit of laughter.

“ Would I could look forth from this dungeon,” pursued
Auriol, again breaking silence, “ and satisfy myself of the
truth or falsehood of my doubts by a view of the external
world, for I am so perplexed in mind, that if I were not
distracted already, they would be enough to drive me so.
What dismal, terrible fancies have possessed me, and weigh
upon me still—the compact with Rougemont—ha !”

“ Now it comes,” cried the listener.

“ Oh, that I could shake off the conviction that this were
not so—that my soul, though heavily laden, might still be
saved! Oh, that I dared to hope this !”

“ T must interrupt him if he pursues this strain,” said
the listener.

“ Whether my crimes are real or imaginary—whether I
snatched the cup of immortality from my grandsire’s dying
lips—whether I signed a compact with the Field, and de-
livered him a victim on each tenth year—I cannot now
know; but if it is so, I deeply, bitterly regret them, and
would expiate my offences by a life of penance.”

At this moment Rougemont, attired in a dress similar to
that of the prisoner, marched up the steps, and cried,
“ What ho, Auriol !—Auriol Darcy !”

“ Who speaks?” demanded Auriol. “ Ah! is it you,
Fiend ?”

“What, you are still in your old fancies,” rejoined

 

 

 

NEW PERPLEXITIES. 191

Rougemont. “ I thought the draught I gave you last night
would have amended you.”

“ Tell me who and what I am,” cried Auriol, stupified
with astonishment; “in what age I am living; and
whether I am in my right mind or not?”

“ For the first, you are called Auriol Darcy,” replied
Rougemont ; “for the second, you are living in the reign of
his most Catholic Majesty James I. of England, and Sixth
of Scotland ; and for the third, I trust you will soon recover
your reason.”

“ Amazement!” cried Auriol, striking his brow with his
clenched hand. Then I am mad.”

“ Tt’s plain your reason is returning, since you are cons
scious of your condition,” replied Rougemont; “ but calm
yourself, you have been subject to raging frenzies.”

“ And I have been shut up here for safety?” demanded
Auriol.

“ Precisely,” observed the other.

“ And you are——"

“ Your keeper,” replied Rougemont.

“ My God! what a brain mine must be!” cried Auriol.
“ Answer me one question—IS there such a person as Abba
Thorneycroft?”

“ You have often raved about her,” replied Rougemont.
‘ But she is a mere creature of the imagination.”

Auriol groaned, and sank against the wall.

“ Since you have become so reasonable, you shall again

go forth into the world,” said Rougemont; “ but the first
essay must be made at night, for fear of attracting observe-
tion. I will come to you again a few hours hence. Fare-
well, for the present.”

And casting a sinister glance at his captive, he turned
upon his heel, descended the steps, and quieted the cell.

- About came, and the cell grew profoundly dark. Auriol
became impatient for the appearance of his keeper, but hour
after hour passed and he did not arrive. Worn out, at
length, with doubt and bewildering speculations, the mise-
rable captive was beset with the desire to put an end to his
torments by suicide, and he determined to execute his fell
purpose without delay. An evil chance seemed also to be-
friend him, for scarcely was the idea formed, than his foot
encountered something on the ground, the rattling of which
attracted his attention, and stopping to take it up, he
grasped the bare blade of a knife.

“ This will, at all events, solve my doubts,” he cried
aloud. “I will sheath this weapon in my heart, and, if I
am mortal, my woes will be ended.” ;

As he spoke, he placed the point to his breast with the

full intent to strike, but before he could inflict the slightest
wound, his arm was forcibly arrested.

“ Would you destroy yourself, madman?” roared a
voice. “I thought your violence was abated, and that you
might go forth in safety. But I find you are worse than
ever.”

Auriol uttered a groan and let the knife fall to the ground.
The new comer kicked it to a distance with his foot.

“ You shall be removed to another chamber,” he pursued,
“ where you can be more strictly watched.”

“Take me forth—oh ! take me forth,” cried Auriol. “It
was a mere impulse of desperation, which I now repent.”

“T dare not trust you. You will commit some act of
insane fury, for which I myself shall have to bear the
blame. When I yielded to your entreaties on a former
occasion, and took you forth, I narrowly prevented you
from doing all we met a mischief.”

“TO have no recollection of any such circumstance,”
returned Auriol, mournful. “ But it may be true, never-
theless. And if so, it only proves the lamentable condition
to which I am reduced—memory and reason gone !”

“ Ay, both gone,” cried the other, with an irrepressible
chuckle.

“ Ha!” exclaimed Auriol, starting. “Iam not so mad
but I recognise in you the Evil Being who tempted me.
I am not so oblivious as to forget our terrible interviews.”

“ What, you are in your lines again!” cried Rougemont,

°

 

 

194 AURIOL.

fiercely. ‘“ Nay, then I must call my assistants, and bind
you.”

“Let me be—let me be!” implored Auriol, “and I will
offend you no more. Whatever thoughts may arise within
me, I will not give utterance to them. Only take me
forth.”

“T came for that purpose,” said Rougemont; “but I
repeat, I dare not. You are not sufficiently master of
yourself.”

“Try me,” said Auriol.

“Well,” rejoined the other, “I will see what I can do to
calm you.”

So saying, he disappeared for a few moments, and then
returning with a torch, placed it on the ground, and pro-
during a phil, handed it to the captive.

“ Drink !” he said.

Without a moment’s hesitation Auriol complied.

“It seems to me rather a stimulant than a soothing
potion,” he remarked, after emptying the phil.

“You are in no condition to judge,” rejoined the other.

And he proceeded to tungsten Auriol’s chain.

‘ Now then, come with me,” he said, “and do not make
any attempt at evasion, or you will run it.”

Like one in a dream, Auriol followed his conductor down
the flight of stone steps leading from the dungeon, and
along a narrow passage. As he proceeded, he thought he

 

 

 

 

DR. LAMB AGAIN. 195

heard stealthy footsteps behind him; but he never turned
his head, to see whether he was really followed. In this
way they reached a short steep staircase, and, mounting it,
entered a vault, in which Rougemont paused, and placed
the torch he had brought with him upon the floor. Its
lurid glimmer partially illumined the chamber, and showed
that it was built of stone. Rude benches of antique form
were set about the vault, and motioning Auriol to be seated
upon one of them, Rougemont sounded a silver whistle.
The summons was shortly afterwards answered by the
dwarf, in whose attire a new change had taken place. He
was now clothed in a perkin of grey serge, fashioned like
the garments worn by the common people in Elizabeth's
reign, and wore a trenches-cap on his head. Auriol
watched him as he timely advanced towards Rougemont,
and had an indistinct recollection of having seen him
before; but could not call to mind how or where.

“Ts your master a-bed ?” demanded Rougemont.

“ A-bed! Good lack, sir!” exclaimed the dwarf, “little
of sleep knows Dr. Lamb. He will toil at the furnace till
the stars have set.”

“ Dr. Lamb !” repeated Auriol. “Surely I have heard
that name before ?”

“ Very likely,” replied Rougemont, “for it is the name
borne by your nearest kinsman.”

“ How is the poor young gentleman ?” asked the dwarf,

02

 

 

 

 

196 AURIOL.

glancing commiseratingly at Auriol. “My master often
makes inquiries after his grandson, and grieve that the
state of his mind should render it necessary to confine
him.”

“His grandson! I—Dr. Lamb’s grandson!” cried
Auriol.

“Tn sooth are you, young sir,” returned the dwarf.
“Were you in your reason, you would be aware that my
master’s name is the same as your own—Darcy— Reginald
Darcy. He assumes the name of Doctor Lamb to delude
the multitude. He told you as much yourself, sweet sir, if
your poor wits would enable you to recollect it.”

“Am I in a dream, good fellow, tell me that?” cried
Auriol, lost in amazement.

“ Black, no, sir,” replied the dwarf; “to my thinking,
you are wide awake. But you know, sir,” he added,
touching his forehead, “ you have been a little wrong here,
and your memory and reason are not of the clearest.”

“Where does my grandsire dwell ?” asked Auriol.

“ Why here, sir,” replied the dwarf; “ and for the matter
of locality, the house is situated on the south end of
London-bridge.”

“On the bridge—did you say on the bridge, friend?”
cried Auriol.

“ As, on the bridge—where else should it be? You
would not have your grandsire live under the river?”

 

 

 

 

DR. LAMB AGAIN. 197

rejoined the dwarf; “though, for ought I know, some of
these vaults may go under it. They are damp enough.”

Auriol was lost in reflection, and did not observe a sign
that passed between the dwarf and Rougemont.

“ Will it disturb Dr. Lamb if his grandson goes up to
him 2” said the latter, after a brief pause.

“ My master does not like to be interrupted in his opera-
tions, as you know, sir,” replied the dwarf, “and seldom
suffers any one, except myself, to enter his laboratory ; but
I will make so bold as to introduce Master Auriol, if he
desires it.”

“ You will confer the greatest favour on me by doing
so,” cried Auriol, rising.

“ Sit down—sit down !” said Rougemont, authoritatively.
“ You cannot go up till the doctor has been apprised. Re-
main here, while Snapdragon and I ascertain his wishes.”
So saying, he quieted the chamber by a farther outlet with
the dwarf.

During the short time that Auriol was left alone, he
found it vain to attempt to settle his thoughts, or to con-
vince himself that he was not labouring under some strange
delusion.

He was accused at length by the dwarf, who returned
alone.

“ Your grandsire will see you,” said the manning.

“ One word before we go,” cried Auricl, seizing his arm.

 

 

 

198 AURIOL.

“ Saints! how you frighten me!” exclaimed the dwarf.
“ You must keep composed, or I dare not take you to my
master.”

“ Pardon me,” replied Auriol; “I meant not to alarm
you. Where is the person who brought me hither ?”

“ What, your keeper?” said the dwarf. ‘Oh, he is
within call. He will come to you anon. Now follow
me.”

And taking up the torch, he led the way out of the
chamber. Mounting a spiral staircase, apparently within
a turret, they came to a door, which being opened by Flap-
dragon, disclosed a scene that well-nigh stupified Auriol.

It was the laboratory precisely as he had seen it above
two centuries ago, The floor was strewn with alchemical
implements—the table was covered with mystic parchments
inscribed with cabalistic characters—the furnace stood in
the corner—crucibles and cucurbites decorated the chimney-
board—the sphere and brazen lamp hung from the ceiling—
the skeletons grinned from behind the chimney-corner—all
was there as he had seen it before! There also was Doctor
Lamb, in his loose gown of sable silk, with a square black
cap upon his venerable head, and his snowy beard streaming
to his girdle.

The old man’s game was fixed upon a crucible placed
upon the furnace, and he was occupied in working the
bellows. He moved his head as Auriol entered the chamber,

 

 

 

 

DR. LAMB AGAIN. 199

and the features became visible. It was a face never to be
forgotten.

“ Come in, grandson,” said the old man, kindly. “ Come
in, and close the door after you. The draught affects the
furnace—my Author, as we adepts term it. So you «is
better, your keeper tells me—much better.”

“ Are you indeed living?” cried Auriol, rushing wildly
towards him, and attempting to take his hand.

“ Off-—off!” cried the old man, drawing back as if
alarmed. ‘“ You disturb my operations. Keep him calm,
Snapdragon, or take him hence. He may do mea mischief.”

“ T have no such intention, sir,” said Auriol; “indeed
Have not. I only wish to be assured that you are my
aged relative.”

“To be sure he is, young sir,” interposed the dwarf.
“ Why should you doubt it?”

“ Oh! sir,” cried Auriol, throwing himself at the old
man’s feet, “pity me if I am mad; but offer me some
explanation, which may tend to restore me to my senses.
My reason seems gone, yet I appear capable of receiving
impressions from external objects. I see you, and appear
to know you. I see this chamber—these alchemical simple-
ments—that furnace—these different objects—and I appear
to recognise them. Am I deceived, or is this real ?”

“ You-are not deceived, my son,” replied the old man.
“ You have been in this room before, and you have seen

 

 

200 AURIOL.

me before. It would be useless to explain to you now how
you have suffered from fever, and what visions your delirium
has produced. When you are perfectly restored, we will
talk the matter over.”

And, as he said this, he began to blow the fire anew,
and watched with great apparent interest the changing
colours of the liquid in the cucurbite placed on the furnace.

Auriol looked at him earnestly, but could not catch
another glance, so intently was the old man occupied. At
length he ventured to break the silence.

“ T should feel perfectly convinced, if I might look forth
from that window,” he said.

“ Convinced of what?” rejoined the old man, somewhat
sharply.

“ That I am what I seem,” replied Auriol.

“ Look forth, then,” said the old man. “ But do not
disturb me by idle talk. There is the rosy colour in the
projection for which I have been so long waiting.”

Auriol then walked to the window and gazed through the
tinted panes. It was very dark, and objects could only be
imperfectly distinguished. Still he fancied he could detect
the gleam of the river beneath him, and what seemed a
long line of houses on the bridge. He also fancied he
discerned other buildings, with the high roofs, the tables,
and the other architectural peculiarities of the structures
of Elizabeth's time. He persuaded himself, also, that he

 

DR. LAMB AGAIN. 201

could distinguish through the gloom the venerable Gothic
pile of Saint Paul’s Cathedral on the other side of the
water, and, as if to satisfy him that he was right, a deep
solemn bell tolled forth the hour of two. After a while he
returned from the window, and said to his supposed grand-
sire, “I am satisfied. I have lived centuries in a few
nights.”

Sir Lionel Flamstead. I have called it a dining-room, from
its ordinary application to the purposes of reflection and
festivity ; but it had much more the air of a library, or
study. It was a small comfortable chamber, just large
enough to contain half a dozen people, though by manage-
ment double that number had been occasionally squeezed
into its narrow limits. The walls were decorated with
curious old prints, maps and plans, set in old black worm-
eaten frames, and representing divers personages, places,
and structures connected with London and its history.
Over the mantelpiece was stretched Vertue’s copy of
Ralph Aggas’s famous survey of our “ great metropolis,”
made about the beginning of Elizabeth’s reign, or perhaps
« little earlier, when it was scarcely so great a metropolis
as at the present time, and when novelists, gentlemen of the
press, carmen, omnibus cars, and other illustrious per-
sonages were unborn and dreamed of; when St. Giles’s,
in lieu of its mysterious and Dealing Seven Dials (which
should have for their motto Wordsworth’s title, “ We are
Seven”), consisted of a little cluster of country houses, sur-
rounded by a grove of elms; when a turreted wall gilded
in the City, from Aldgate to Grey Friars; when a pack of
stag-hounds was kept in Finsbury-fields, and archers and
cross-bowmen haunted the purlicus of the Spital; when he
who strolled westward from Charing-cross (then no mis-
homer) beheld neither Opera House nor club-house, but a
rustic lane, with a barn at one end, and a goodly assortment

 

 

THE OLD LONDON MERCHANT. 209

of hay-carts and hay-stacks at the other; when the Thames
was crossed by a single bridge, and that bridge looked like
a street, and the street itself like a row of palaces. On the
right of this plan hung a sketch of Will Somers, jester to
Henry VIII., after the picture by Holbein; on the left an
engraving of Geoffrey Hudson, the diminutive attendant of
Henrietta Maria. This niche was devoted to portraits of
the bluff king before mentioned, and his six spouses; that
to the melancholy Charles and his family. Here, the Great
Fire of 1666, with its black profiles of houses, relieved by
a sheet of “bloody and malicious” flame, formed a pleasant
contrast to the icy wonders of the Frost Fair, held on the
Thames in 1684, when carriages were driven through the
. lines of tents, and an ox was roasted on the water, to the
infinite delectation of the citizens. There Old Saint Paul’s
(in the words of Victor Hugo, “ one of those Gothic menu-
ments so admirable and so irreparable”), and which is but
ill replaced by the modern “ bastard counterpart” of the
glorious fane of St. Peter at Rome, reared its venerable
tower (not dome) and lofty spire to the sky. Next to St.
Paul’s came the reverend Abbey of Westminster, taken
before it had been disfigured by the towers added by Wren;
and next to the abbey opened the long and referred vista of
its magnificent neighbouring hall. Several plans and
prospects of the Tower of London, as it appeared at
different epochs, occupied a corner to themselves: then
came a long array of taverns, from the Tabard in South-

Temple-bar, embalmed in the odour of poesy, to the Nag’s

The Swan at Donated, a tavern well known;

The Mitre in Cheap, and then the Bull's Head,

And, now, of late, Saint Martin's in the Street ;

The Windmill in Lothbury; the Ship at the’ Exchange;

King’s Head in New Fish-street, where oysters do range;

‘The Mermaid in Cornhill; Red Lion in the Strand ;

Three Runs in Newgate Market; in Old Fish-street the Swan.

Adjoining these places of entertainment were others of a
different description, to with, the Globe, as it stood when
Shakspeare (how insufferable is Mr. Knight’s orthography
of this reverend name—Shakspere) trod the stage; the
king’s play-house in Charles the Second’s time; the Bear-
garden, with its flag streaming to the wind; and the Folly,
as it once floated in the river, opposite old Somerset House.
Then came the Halls, beginning with Guildhall and ending
with Old Skinner’s. Next, the Crosses, from Paul's to
Charing; then, the churches, gateways, hospitals, colleges,
prisons, asylums, inns of court,—in short, for it is needless

tions rose before you, as you gazed around. Scarcely an
old edifice, to which an historical tradition could be attached
(and what old London edifice is destitute of such traditions 7),
was wanting. Nor were the great of old—the spirits, who
gave interest and endurance to these decayed, or decaying
structures, wanting. But I shall not pause to enumerate
their portraits, or make out a catalogue as long as the list
of Homer’s ships, or the gallery of Mr. Lodge. Sufficient
has been said, I trust, to give the reader an idea of the
physiology of the room. Yet stay! I must not omit to
point out the contents of those groaning shelves. In the
goodly folios crowded there are contained the chronicles of
Holinshed and Hall; of Grafton, Fabian, and Stow; of
Mathew of Paris, and his namesake of Westminster. Let
him not be terrified at the ponderous size of these admirable
old historians, nor be deterred by the black letter, if he
should chance to open a volume. Their freshness and pic-
treasure details will surprise as much as they will delight
him. From this wealthy mine Shakspeare drew some of his
purest ore. The shelves are crowned by solitary bust. It
is that of a modern. It is that of a lover of London, and
a character of London. It is Doctor Johnson.

Having completed the survey of the apartment, I shall
now proceed to its occupants. These were five in number
—jolly fellows all—seated round a circular dining-table
covered with glasses and decanters, amidst which a portly
magnum of claret, and a deep and capacious china punch-

bowl, must not pass unmentioned. They were in the full
flow of fun and conviviality ; enjoying themselves as good
fellows always enjoy themselves at “ the season of the year.”
The port was delectable—old as Saint Paul's, I was going
to say—not quite, however—but just “old enough;” the
claret was nectar, or, what is better, it was Lafitte; the
punch was drink for the gods. The jokes of this party
would have split your sides—their laughter would have had
the same effect on your ears. Never were heard peals of
merriment so hearty and prolonged. You only wondered
how they found time to drink, so quick did each roar follow
on the heels of its predecessor. That they did drink, how-
ever, was clear; that they had drunk was equally certain ;
and that they intended to continue drinking seemed to come
within the limits of probability.

Sir Lionel Flamsteed was a retired merchant—one of
those high-fouled, high-principled traders, of whom our
City was once so justly proud, and of whom so few, in these
days of railway bubbles, and other harebrained specula-
tions, can be found. His word was his bond—once passed,
it was sufficient; his acceptances were accounted safe as
the Bank of England. Had Sir Thomas Gresham descended
from his niche he could not have been treated with greater
consideration than attended Sir Lionel’s appearance on
"Change. All eyes followed the movements of his tall and
stately figure—all hats were raised to his courteous but
ceremonious salutation. Affable, yet precise, and tincture

with something of the punctitiousness of the old school, his
manners won him universal respect and regard, even from
those unknown to him. By his intimates he was revered.
His habits were as regular as clockwork, and the glass of
cold punch at Tom’s, or the basin of soup at Birch’s, wound
him up for the day. His attire was as formal as his
manners, being a slight modification of the prevalent
costume of some five-and-thirty years ago. He had con-
seated, not without extreme reluctance, to clothe his nether
limbs in the unmentionable garment of recent introduction ;
but he resolutely adhered to the pigtail. There is some-
thing, by-the-by, in a pigtail, to which old gentlemen cling
in spite of all remonstrate, with lover-like pertinacity.
Only hint the propriety of cutting it off to your great-uncle
or your grandfather, and you may rely on being cut off with
a shilling yourself. Be this as it may, Sir Lionel gathered
his locks, once sable as the riband that bound them, but
now thickly strewn with the silver “ blossoms of the grave,”
into a knot, and suffered them to angle a few inches below
his collar. His shoes shone with a lustre beyond French
polish, and his hat was brushed till not a wind dared to ap-
roach it. Sir Lionel wore a white, unstarched cravat, with
a thick pad in it, sported a frill over his waistcoat, carried
a black ebony cane in his hand, and was generally followed
by a pet pug-dog, one of the most sagacious and disagree-
able specimens of his species. Sir Lionel Flamstead, I have
said, was all—I might have said he was very tall—some-

what narrower across the shoulders than about the hips—a
circumstance which did not materially conduct to his
symmetry—with grey, benevolent eyes, shaded by bushy,
intelligent brows—a lofty, expansive forehead, in which,
in the jargon of phrenology, the organs of locality and
ideality were strongly developed, and which was rendered
the more remarkable from the flesh having fallen in on
either side of the temples—with a nose which had been
considered handsome and well proportioned in his youth,
but to which good living had imparted a bottle form and a
bottle tint—and cheeks from which all encroachment of
whiskers was sedulously removed, in order, we conclude,
that his rosy complexion might be traced from its point of
concentration, upon the prominent feature before mentioned,
to its final disappearance behind his ears. Such was Sir

Lionel Flamstead.

A NIGHT'S ADVENTURE IN ROME,

L
SANTA MARIA MAGGIORE.

“The Pope was saying the high, high mass,
All on Saint Peter’s day;
With the power to him given by the saints in heaven
To wash men’s sins away.

“The Pope he was saying the blessed mass,
And the people kneel’d around;
And from each man’s soul his sins did pass,
As he missed the holy ground.”

The Gray Brother,
Cuaxcrxe to be in Rome in the August of 1830, 1
visited the gorgeous church of Santa Maria Maggiore
during the celebration of the anniversary of the Holy
Assumption.
It was a glorious sight to one unaccustomed to the im-
posing religious ceremonials of the Romish church, to with-

 

 

 

 

216 A NIGHT'S ADVENTURE IN ROME.

ness all the pomp and splendour displayed at this high
solemnity—to gaze down that glittering pile, and mark the
various ecclesiastical dignitaries, each in their peculiar and
characteristic costume, employed in the administration of their
sacred functions, and surrounded by a wide semicircle of the
papal guards, 60 stationed to keep back the crowd, and
who, with their showy scarlet attire and tall halberds,
looked like the martial figures we see in the sketches of
Callot. Nor was the brilliant effect of this picture dim-
wished by the sumptuous framework in which it was set.
Overhead blamed a roof resplendent with burnished gold ;
before me rose a canopy supported by pillars of porphyry,
and shining with many-coloured stones; while on either
hand were chapels devoted to some noble house, and boast-
in each the marble memorial of a pope. Melodious masses
proper to the service were ever and anon chanted by the
papal choir, and overpowering perfume was diffused around
by a hundred censers.

Subdued by the odours, the music, and the spectacle, I
sank into a state of dreamy enthusiasm, during a continue-
ance of which I almost fancied myself a convert to the faith
of Rome, and surrendered myself unreflectingly to an ad-
migration of its errors. As I gazed among the surrounding
crowd, the sight of so many prostrate figures, all in atti-
tudes of deepest devotion, satisfied me of the profound
religious impression of the ceremonial. As elsewhere, this
feeling was not universal; and, as elsewhere, likewise, more

 

 

A NIGHT'S ADVENTURE IN ROME. 217

zeal was exhibited by the lower than the higher classes of
society ; and I occasionally noted amongst the latter the
glitter of an eye or the flutter of a bosom, not altogether
agitated, I suspect, by holy aspirations. Yet methought,
on the whole, I had never seen such abandonment of soul,
such prostration of spirit, in my own colder crime, and
during the exercise of my own more chastened creed, as
that which in several instances I now beheld; and I almost
envied the poor maiden near me, who, abject upon the
earth, had washed away her sorrows, and perhaps her sins,
in contrite tears. .

As such thoughts swept through my mind, I felt a plea-
sure in singling out particular figures and groups which in-
interest me, from their peculiarity of costume, or from
their devotional fervour. Amongst others, a little to my
left, I remarked a band of mountaineers from Calabria, for
such A judged them to be from their wild and picturesque
garb. Deeply was every individual of this little knot of
peasantry impressed by the ceremonial. Every eye was
humbly cast down; every knee bent; every hand was
either occupied in grasping the little crucifix suspended
from its owner's neck, in telling the beads of his rosary, or
fervently crossed upon his bare and swarthy breast.

While gazing upon this group, I chanced upon an indi-
visual whom I had not hitherto noticed, and who now ire-
possibly attracted my attention. Though a little removed
from the Calabrian mountaineers, and reclining against the

 

 

 

218 A NIGHT’S ADVENTURE IN ROME.

marble walls of the church, he evidently belonged to the
same company; at least, so his attire seemed to indicate,
though the noble cast of his countenance was far superior
to that of his comrades. He was an old man, with a face
of the fine antique Roman stamp—a bold outline of dromi-
next nose, rugged and imperious brow, and proudly-cut
chin. His head and china, as well as his naked breast, were
frosted over with the snowy honours of many winters, and
their hoar appearance contrasted strikingly with the tawny
hue of a skin almost as dark and as lustrous as polished
oak. Peasant as he was, there was something of grandeur
and majesty in this old man’s demeanour and physiognomy.
His head declined backwards, so as completely to expose
his long and muscular throat. His arms hung listlessly by
his side; one hand drooped upon the pavement, the other
was placed within his breast: his eyes were closed. The
old man’s garb was of the coarsest fabric; he wore little
beyond a shirt, a loose vest, a sort of sheep-skin cloak, and
canvas leggings bound around with leather thongs. His
appearance, however, was above his condition; he became
his rags as proudly as a prince would have become his
ermined robe.

The more I scrutinised the rigid lines of this old man’s
countenance, the more I became satisfied that many sin-
gulag, and perhaps not wholly guiltless, events were con-
netted with his history. The rosary was in his hand—the
cross upon his breast—the beads were untold—the crucifix

 

 

 

A NIGHT'S ADVENTURE IN ROME. 219

unleashed -—no breath of prayer passed his lips. His face
was turned heavenward, but his eyes were closed,—he
dared not open them. Why did he come thither, if he did
not venture to pray? Why did he assume a penitential
attitude, if he felt no penitence?

So absorbed was I in the perusal of the workings of this
old man’s countenance, as to be scarcely conscious that the
service of high mass was concluded, and the crowd within
the holy pile fast dispersing. The music was hushed, the
robed prelates and their train had disappeared, joyous dames
were hastening along the marble aisles to their equipages ;
all, have a few kneeling figures near the chapels, were de-
parting ; and the old man, aware, from the star and hum
prevailing around, that the ceremonial was at an end, arose,
stretched out his arm to one of his comrades, a youth who
had joined him, and prepared to follow the concourse.

Was he really blind? Assuredly not. Besides, he did
not walk like as one habituated to the direst calamity that
can befal our nature. He staggered in his gait, and reeled
to and fro. Yet wherefore did he not venture to enclose his
eyes within the temple of the Most High? What would I
not have given to be made acquainted with his history !
For I felt that it must be a singular one.

I might satisfy my curiosity at once. He was moving
slowly forward, guided by his comrade. In a few seconds
it would be too late—he would have vanished from my
sight. With hasty footsteps I followed him down the

 

 

 

220 A NIGHT'S ADVENTURE IN ROME.

church, and laid my hand, with some violence, upon his
shoulder.

The old man started at the touch, and turned. Now,
indeed, his eyes were opened wide, and flashing full upon
me,—and such eyes! Heretofore I had only dreamed of
such. Age had not quenched their lightning, and I quailed
beneath the fierce glances which he threw upon me. But if
Was, at first, surprised at the display of anger which I had
called forth in him, how much more was I astonished to
behold the whole expression of his countenance suddenly
change. His eyes continued fixed upon mine as if I had
been a basilisk. Apparently he could not avert them;
while his whole frame shivered with emotion. I advanced
towards him; he shrank backwards, and, but for the timely
aid of his companion, would have fallen upon the pave-
ment.

At a loss to conceive in what way I could have coca-
signed him so much alarm, I rushed forward to the assist-
ance of the old man, when his son, for such it subsequently
appeared he was, rudely repelled me, and thrust his hand
into his girdle, as if to seek for means to prevent further
interference.

Meanwhile the group had been increased by the arrival
of a third party, attracted by the cry the old man had
uttered in falling. The new comer was an Italian gentle-
man, somewhat stricken in years; of stern and stately de-
portment, and with something sinister and forbidding in his

 

 

A NIGHT'S ADVENTURE IN ROME. 221

aspect. He was hastening towards the old man, but he
suddenly stopped, and was about to retire when he couldn-
tered my gaze. As our eyes met he started; and a terror,
as sudden and lively as that exhibited by the old man, was
at once depicted in his features.

My surprise was now beyond all bounds, and I continued
for some moments speechless with astonishment. Not a
little of the inexplicable awe which affected the old man
and the stranger was communicated to myself. Alto-
gather, we formed a mysterious and terrible triangle, of
which each side bore some strange and unintelligible real-
tion to the other.

The new comer first recovered his composure, though not
without an effort. Coldly turning his heel upon me, he
walked towards the old man, and shook him forcibly. The
latter shrank from his grasp, and endeavoured to avoid
him ; but it was impossible. The stranger whispered a few
words in his year, of which, from his gestures being directed
towards myself, I could guess the import. The old man
replied. His action in doing so was that of supplication
and despair, The stranger retorted in a wild and vehement
manner, and even stamped upon the ground; but the old
man still continued to cling to the knees of his superior.

“Weak, superstitious fool!” at length exclaimed the
stranger, “ I will waste no more words upon thee. Do, or
say, what thou wilt; but beware!” And spurning him
haughtily back with his foot, he strode away.

 

 

 

 

 

222 A NIGHT’S ADVENTURE IN ROME.

The old man’s reverend head struck against the marble
floor. His temple was cut open by the fall, and blood
gushed in torrents from the wound. Recovering himself,
he started to his feet-—a knife was instantly in his hand,
and he would have pursued and doubtless slain his ag-
resort, if he had not been forcibly withheld by his son,
and by a priest who had joined them.

“ Maledizione!” exclaimed the old man—“ a blow from
him—from that hand! I will stab him, though he were at
the altar’s foot; though he had a thousand lives, each
should pay for it. Release me, Paolo! release me! for,
by Heaven ! he dies !”

“ Peace, father!” cried the son, still struggling with
him.

“ Thou art not my son, to hinder my revenge !” shouted
the enraged father. “ Dost not see this blood—my blood
—the father’s blood ?—and thou oldest me back! Thou
should have struck him to the earth for the deed—but
he was a noble, and thou largest not lift the hand against
him !”

“ Would thou have had me slay him in this holy
place ?” exclaimed Paolo, reddening with anger and sup-
pressed emotion.

“No, no,” returned the old man, in an altered voice;
“not here, not here, though "there but just retribution.
But I will find other means of vengeance. I will denounce

 

 

 

 

A NIGHT'S ADVENTURE IN ROME. 223

him—I will betray all, though it cost me my own life! He
shall die by the hands of the common executioner ;—there
is one shall testify for me!" And he pointed to me.

Again I advanced towards him.

“If thou hast taught to disclose pertaining to the Holy
Church, I am ready to listen to the, my son,” said the
priest; “but reflect well ere thou bringest any charge
thou mayest not be able to substantiate against one who
stands so high in her esteem as him thou would accuse.”

The son gave his father a meaning look, and whispered
somewhat in his ear. The old man became suddenly still.

“ Right, right,” said he; “I have rethought me. "Was
but a Low. He is wealthy, I am poor; there is no justice
for the poor in Rome.”

“ My purse is at your service,” said I, interfering ; “you
shall have my aid.”

“ Your aid!” echoed the old man, staring at me; “ will
you assist me, signor ?”

“Twill.”

“Enough. I may claim fulfilment of your promise.”

“ Stop, old man,” I said; “ answer me one question are
you depart. Whence arose your recent terrors ?”

“ You shall know hereafter, signor,” he said; “I must
now bygone. We shall meet again. Follow me not,” he
continued, seeing I was bent upon obtaining further play-
nation of the mystery. “ You will learn nothing now, and

 

 

224 A NIGHT'S ADVENTURE IN ROME,

only endanger my safety. Addio, signor.” And with hasty
steps he quieted the church, accompanied by his son.

“Who is that old man ?” I demanded of the priest.

“T am as ignorant as yourself,” he replied, “ but he
must be looked to; the talks threateningly.” And he
beckoned to an attendant.

“Who was he who struck him ?” was my next inquiry.

“One of our wealthiest nobles,” he replied, “and an
assured friend of the church. We could ill spare him. Do
not lose sight of them,” he added to the attendant, “ and
let the sbirri track them to their haunts. They must not
be suffered to go forth to-night. A few hours’ restraint
will cool their hot Calabrian blood.”

“ But the name of the noble, father?” I said, renewing
my inquiries.

“ T must decline further questioning,” returned the priest,
coldly. “I have other occupation; and meanwhile it will
be well to have these stains effaced, which may else bring
scandal on these holy walls. You will excuse me, my son.”
So saying, he bowed and retired.

I made fruitless inquiries for the old man at the door of
the church. He was gone; none of the bystanders who
had seen him go forth knew whither.

Stung by curiosity, I wandered amid the most unfre-
quented quarters of Rome throughout the day, in the hope
of meeting with the old Calabrian, but in vain. As, how-
ever, I entered the court-yard of my hotel, I fancied I is-

 

 

A NIGHT’S ADVENTURE IN ROME. 225

covered, amongst the lounging assemblage gathered round
the door, the dark eyes of the younger mountaineer. In
this I might have been mistaken. No one answering to his
description had been seen near the house.

IN

THE MARCHESA,

Une chose ténéreuse fait par des hommes ténébreux.—Lunches
Borax.

On the same night I bent my steps towards the Color-
sum; and, full of my adventure of the morning, found
myself, not without apprehension, involved within its lab-
printing passages. Accompanied by a monk, who, with a
small horn lantern in his hand, acted as my guide, I fancied
that, by its uncertain light, I could discover stealthy figures
lurking within the shades of the ruin.

Whatever suspicions I might entertain, I pursued my
course in silence. Emerging from the vittorio, we stood
upon the steps of the colossal amphitheatre. The huge pile
was bathed in rosy moonlight, and reared itself in serene
majesty before my view.

While indulging in a thousand speculations, occasioned
by the hour and the spot, I suddenly perceived a figure on
a point of the ruin immediately above me. Nothing but
the head was visible; but that was placed in bold relief

Q

 

 

 

226 A NIGHT'S ADVENTURE IN ROME,

against the beaming sky of night, and I recognised it at
once. No nobler Roman head had ever graced the circus
when Rome was in her zenith. I shouted to the old Cala-
brian, for he it was I beheld. Almost are the sound had
left my lips, he had disappeared. I made known what I
had seen to the monk. He was alarmed—urged our in-
stant departure, and advised me to seek the assistance of
the sentinel stationed at the entrance to the pile. To this
proposal I assented; and, having descended the vast steps
and crossed the open arena, we arrived, without molesta-
tion, at the doorway.

The sentinel had allowed no one to pass him. He re-
turned with me to the circus; and, after an ineffectual
search amongst the ruins, volunteered his services to a-
company me homewards through the Forum. I declined
his offer, and shaped my course towards a lonesome vicolo
on the right. This was courting danger; but I cared not,
and walked slowly forward through the deserted place.

Scarcely had I proceeded many paces, when I heard
footsteps swiftly approaching; and, here I could turn round,
my arms were seized from behind, and a bandage was
passed across my eyes. All my efforts at liberation were
unarsiling; and, after a brief struggle, I remained passive.

“Make no noise,” said a voice which I knew to be that
of the old man, “and no harm shall befal you. You must
come with us. Ask no questions, but follow.”

I suffered myself to be led, without further opposition,

 

A NIGHT’S ADVENTURE IN ROME. 227

whithersoever they listed. We walked for it might be half
an hour, much beyond the walls of Rome. I had to scramble
through many ruins, and frequently stumbled over in-
equalities of ground. I now felt the fresh breeze of night
blowing over the wide campagna, and my conductors moved
swiftly onwards as we trod on its elastic turf.

At length they came to a halt. My bandage was re-
moved, and I beheld myself beneath the arch of an aqueduct,
which spanned the moonlit plain. A fire was kindled be-
neath the arch, and the ruddy flame licked its walls.
Around the blaze were grouped the little band of peasantry
I had beheld within the church, in various and picturesque
attitudes. They greeted my conductors on their arrival, and
glanced inquisitively at me, but did not speak to me. The
elder Calabrian, whom they addressed as Cristiano, asked
for a glass of aqua vite, which he handed respectfully to
me. I declined the offer, but he pressed it upon me.

“ You will need it, signor,” he said; “you have much to
do to-night. You fear, perhaps, it is drugged. Behold!”
And he drank it off.

I could not, after this, refuse his pledge. “ And now,
signor,” said the old man, removing to a little distance
from the group, “may I crave a word with you—your
name ?”

As I had no reason for withholding it, I told him how I
was called.

“Hum! Had you no relation of the name of ——?”

 

 

228 A NIGHT’S ADVENTURE IN ROME,

“None whatever.” And I sighed, for I thought of my
desolate condition.

“ Strange!” he muttered; adding, with a grim smile,
“but, however, likenesses are easily accounted for.”

“ What likenesses?” I asked. “ Whom do I resemble ?
and what is the motive of your inexplicable conduct ?”

“ You shall hear,” he replied, frowning gloomily. “ Step
aside, and let us get within the shade of these arches, out
of the reach of yonder listeners, The tale I have to tell is
for your ears alone.”

I obeyed him; and we stood beneath the shadow of the
aqueduct.

“ Years ago,” began the old man, “an Englishman, in
all respects resembling yourself, equally well-favoured in
person, and equally young, came to Rome, and took up his
abode within the eternal city. He was of high rank in his
own country, and was treated with the distinction due to
his exalted station here. At that time I dwelt with the
Marchese di I was his confidential servant—his ad-
viper—his friend. I had lived with his father—carried him
as an infant—sported with him as a boy—loved and served
him as man. Loved him, I say; for, despite his treat-
ment of me, I loved him then as much as I abhor him now.
Well! signor, to my story. If his youth had been polish-
gate, his manhood was not less depraved; it was devoted
to cold, calculating libertinism. Soon after he succeeded
to the estates and title of his father, he married. That he

 

 

 

A NIGHT’S ADVENTURE IN ROME. 229

loved his bride, I can scarcely believe; for, though he was
wildly jealous of her, he was himself unfaithful, and she
knew it. In Italy, revenge, in such cases, is easily within
@ woman’s power; and, for caught I know, the marchesa
might have meditated retaliation. My lord, however, took
the alarm, and thought it to retire to his villa without the
city, and for a time remained secluded within its walls. It was
at this crisis that the Englishman I have before mentioned
arrived in Rome. My lady, who mingled little with the
varieties of the city, had not beheld him; but she could not
have been unacquainted with him by report, as every tongue
was loud in his praises. A rumour of his successes with
other dames had reached my lord; nay, I have reason to
believe that he had been thwarted by the handsome Eng-
lishman in some other quarter, and he sedulously pre-
vented their meeting. An interview, however, did take
place between them, and in an unexpected manner, It was
the custom then, as now, upon particular occasions, to
drive, during the heat of summer, within the Piazza
Navona, which is flooded with water. One evening the
marchesa drove thither: she was unattended, except by
myself. Our carriage happened to be stationed near that
of the young Englishman.”

“The marchesa was beautiful, no doubt ?” I said, inter-
erupting him.

“ Most beautiful!” he replied; “and so your country-
man seemed to think, for he was lost in admiration of her.

|

 

 

230 A NIGHT'S ADVENTURE IN ROME,

T am not much versed in the language of the eyes, but his
were too eloquent and expressive not to be understood. I
watched my mistress narrowly. It was evident from her
glowing cheek, though her eyes were cast down, that she
was not insensible to his regards. She turned to play
with her dog, a lovely little greyhound, which was in the
carriage beside her, and patted it carelessly with the glove
which she held in her hand. The animal snatched the
glove from her grasp, and, as he bounded backwards, fell
over the carriage side. My lady uttered a scream at the
sight, and I was preparing to extricate the struggling dog,
when the Englishman plunged into the water. In an instant
he had restored her favourite to the marchesa, and received
her warmest acknowledgments. From that moment an in-
impact commenced, which was destined to produce the most
fatal consequences to both parties.”

“Did you betray them ?” I asked, somewhat impatiently.

“ T was then the blind tool of the marchese. I did so,”
replied the old man. “TI told him all particulars of the
interview. He heard me in silence, but grew ashy pale
with suppressed rage. Bidding me redouble my vigilance,
he left me. My lady was now scarcely ever out of my
sight; when one evening, a few days after what had oc-
curved, she walked forth alone upon the garden-terrace of
the villa. Her guitar was in her hand, and her favourite
dog by her side. I was at a little distance, but wholly un-
perceived. She struck a few plaintive chords upon her

 

 

A NIGHT’S ADVENTURE IN ROME. 231

instrument, and then, resting her chin upon her white and
rounded arm, seemed lost in tender reverie. Would you
had seen her, signor, as I beheld her then, or as one other
beheld her! you would acknowledge that you had never
met with her equal in beauty. Her raven hair fell in thick
tresses over shoulders of dazzling whiteness and the most
perfect proportion. Her deep dark eyes were thrown lan-
widely on the ground, and her radiant features were charged
with an expression of profound and pensive passion.

“In this musing attitude she continued for some minutes,
when she was aroused by the symbols of her dog, who bore
in his mouth a glove which he had found. As she took it
from him, a letter dropped upon the floor. Had a serpent
glided from its folds, it could not have started her more.
She gazed upon the paper, offended, but irresolute. Yes,
she was irresolute ; and you may conjecture the rest. She
paused, and by that pause was lost. With a shrinking
grasp she stooped to raise the letter. Her cheeks, which
had grown deathly pale, again kindled with brushes as she
perused it. She hesitated—cast a bewildering look towards
the mansion—placed the note within her bosom—and
plunged into the orange-bower.”

“ Her lover awaited her there ?”

“He did. I saw them meet. I heard his frenzied words
—his passionate entreaties. He urged her to fly—she re-
listed. He grew more urgent—more impassioned. She
uttered a faint cry, and I stood before them. The English-

man's and was at my throat, and his sword at my breast,
with the swiftness of thought; and but for the screams of
my mistress, that instant must have been my last. At her
desire he relinquished his hold of me; but her cries had
reached other ears, and the marchese arrived to avenge his
injured honour. He paused not to inquire the nature of
the offence, but, sword in hand, assailed the Englishman,
bidding me remove his lady. The clash of their steel was
drowned by her shrieks as I bore her away; but I knew
the strife was desperate. Before I gained the house my
lady had fainted; and, committing her to the charge of
other attendants, I returned to the terrace. I met my
master slowly walking homewards. His sword was gone—
his brow was bent—he shunned my sight. I knew what
had happened, and did not approach him. He sought his
wife. What passed in that interview was never disclosed,
but it may be guessed at from its result. That night the
marchesa left her husband's halls—never to return. Next
morn I visited the terrace where she had received the
token. The glove was still upon the ground. I picked it
up and carried it to the marchese, detailing the whole
occurrence to him. He took it, and vowed as he took it
that his vengeance should never rest satisfied till that glove
had been steeped in her blood.”

“ And he kept his vow ?” I asked, shuddering.

“Many months elapsed ere its accomplishment. Italian
vengeance is slow, but sure. To all outward appearance,

 

 

 

A NIGHT’S ADVENTURE IN ROME. 233

he had forgotten his faithless wife. He had even formed a
friendship with her lover, which he did the more effectually
to blind his ultimate designs. Meanwhile, time rolled on,
and the marchesa gave birth to a child—the offspring of
her seducer.”

“ Great God !” I exclaimed, “ was that child a boy ?”

“It was—but listen to me. My tale draws to a close.
One night, during the absence of the Englishman, by secret
means we entered the palazzo where the marchesa resided.
We wandered from room to room till we came to her
chamber. She was sleeping, with her infant by her side.
The sight maddened the marchese. He would have stricken
the child, but I held back his hand. He relented. Ie
bade me make fast the door. He approached the bed. I
heard a hustle—a scream. A white figure sprang from out
the couch. In an instant the light was extinguished—
there was a blow—another—and all was over. I threw
open the door. The marchese came forth. The corridor in
which we stood was flooded with moonlight. A glove was
in his hand—it was dripping with blood. His oath was
fulfilled—his vengeance complete—no, not complete, for
the Englishman yet lived.”

“ What became of him ?” I inquired.

“ Ask me not,” replied the old man; “ you were at the
Chiesa Santa Maria Maggiore this morning. If those
stones could speak, they might tell a fearful story.”

“ And that was the reason you did not dare to uncover

 

 

234 A NIGHT’S ADVENTURE IN ROME.

your eyes within those holy precincts?—a film of blood
floated between you and heaven.”

The old man shuttered, but replied not.

“And the child?” I asked, after a pause; “ what of
their wretched offspring 2?”

“ It was conveyed to England by a friend of its dead
father. If he were alive, that boy would be about your
age, signor.”

“Indeed !" I said; a horrible suspicion flashing across
my mind.

“ After the Englishman’s death,” continued Cristiano,
“my master began to treat me with a coldness and sus-
picion which increased daily. I was a burden to him, and
he was resolved to rid himself of me. I spared him the
trouble—quieted Rome—sought the mountains of the
Abruzzi—and thence wandered to the fastness of Cala-
bria, and became—no matter what. Here I am, Heaven’s
appointed minister of vengeance. The marchese dies to-
night !”

“To-night! old man,” I echoed, horror-stricken. “ Add
not crime to crime. If he has indeed been guilty of the
foul offence you have named, let him be dealt with accord-
in to the offended laws of the country. Do not pervert
the purposes of justice.”

“ Justice !” echoed Cristiano, scornfully.

“ Ay, justice. You are poor and powerless, but means

 

by

may be found to aid you. I will assist the rightful course
of vengeance.”

“ You shall assist it. Have sworn he shall die before
dawn, and the hand to strike the blow shall be yours.”

“ Mine !—never !”

“ Your own life will be the penalty of your obstinacy, if
you refuse; nor will your refusal save him. By the Mother
of Heaven, he dies! and by your hand. You saw how he
was struck by your resemblance to the young Englishman
this morning in the chiesa, It is wonderful! I know not
who or what you are; but to me you are an instrument of
vengeance, and as such I shall use you. The blow dealt
by you will see the work of retribution; and I care not
if you strike twice, and make my heart your second mark.”

Ere I could reply he called to his comrades, and in a few
moments we were speeding across the campagna.

We arrived at a high wall: the old man conducted us to
@ postern-gate, which he opened. We entered a garden
filled with orange-trees, the perfume of which loaded the
midnight air. We heard the splash of a fountain at a dis-
dance, and the thrilling notes of a nightingale amongst
some taller trees. The moon hung like a lamp over the
belvidere of the proud villa. We strode along a wide ter-
race edged by a marble balustrade. The old man pointed
to an open summer-house terminating the walk, and gave
me 4 significant look, but he spoke not. A window thrown

 

 

 

236 A NIGHT'S ADVENTURE IN ROME,

open admitted us to the house. We were within a hall
crowded with statues, and traversed noiselessly its marble
floors, Passing through several chambers, we then mounted
to a corridor, and entered an apartment which formed the
ante-room to another beyond it. Placing his finger upon
his lips, and making a sign to his comrades, Cristiano
opened a door and disappeared. There was a breathless
pause for a few minutes, during which I listened intently,
but caught only a faint sound as of the snapping of a lock.

Presently the old man returned.

“ He sleeps,” he said, in a low deep tone to me; “ sleeps
as his victim slept—sleeps without a dream of remorse;
and he shall awaken, as she awoke, to despair. Come into
his chamber !”

We obeyed. The door was made fast within side.

The curtains of the couch were withdrawn, and the
moonlight streamed full upon the face of the sleeper. He
was rushed in profound repose. No visions seemed to haunt
his peaceful slumbers. Could guilt sleep so soundly? I
half doubted the old man’s story.

Placing us within the shadow of the canopy, Cristiano
approached the bed. A stiletto littered in his hand.
« Awake !” he cried, in a voice of thunder.

The sleeper started at the summons.

I watched his countenance. He read Cristofori’s errand
in his eye. But he quailed not.

 

 

 

A NIGHT'S ADVENTURE IN ROME. 237

“ Cowardly assassin !” he cried, “ you have well consulted
your own safety in stealing on my sleep.”

“ And who taught me the lesson?” fiercely interrupted
the old man. Aw I the first that have stolen on mid-
night slumber? Gaze upon this? When and how did it
acquire its dye?” And he held forth a glove, which looked \
blackened and stained in the moonlight.

The marchese groaned aloud.

“ My cabinet broken open!” at length he exclaimed—
“ villain! how dared you do this? But why doI rave? I
know with whom I have to deal.” Uttering these words he
sprung from his couch with the intention of grappling with
the old man; but Cristiano retreated, and at that instant
the brigands, who rushed to his aid, thrust me forward. I
was face to face with the marchese.

The apparition of the murdered man could not have
staggered him more. His limbs were stiffened by the
shock, and he remained in an attitude of freezing terror.

“Ts he come for vengeance ?” he ejaculated.

“He is!” cried Cristiano. “Give him the weapon!”
And a stiletto was thrust into my hand. But I needed not
the steel. I tore open my bosom—a small diamond cross
was within the folds.

“Do you recollect this ?” I demanded of the marchese.

“It was my wife’s!” he shielded, in amazement.

“It was upon the infant’s bosom as he slept by her side

on that fatal night,” said Cristiano. “I saw it sparkle
there.”

“ That infant was myself—that wife my mother!” I cried.

“The murderer stands before you! Strike!” exclaimed
Cristiano. .

T raised the dagger. The marchese stirred not. I could
not strike. :

“ Do you hesitate 2” angrily exclaimed Cristiano.

“ He has not the courage,” returned the younger Cala-
brian. “You reproacked me this morning with want of
filial duty. Behold how a son can avenge his father!”
And he plunged his stiletto within the bosom of the mar-
these.

“ Your father is not yet avenged, young man!” cried
Cristiano, in a terrible tone. ‘ You alone can avenge
him !”

Ere I could withdraw its point the old man had rushed
upon the dagger which I held extended in my grasp.

He fell without a single groan.

NOVELS.

From “The Times.”

“« Among the most surprising instances of the immense revolution which has taken
place of late years in popular are the cheap publications of Messrs. Rout-
Edge and Co., of the Broadway. For several years they have been issuing the
* Railway Library,’ and have shown an energy and enterprise in many fields of liters-
ture almost unparalleled in this country. We believe the great success which to
have met with has arisen from the universally popular character of the works which
they have issued. Their books are never above and never below the standard of
public taste. Looking over their list of books, we cannot but with the ‘ Railway
Library’ a continuation of the immense sale which has hitherto attended it.”

*.° The columns of prices show the forms in which the Books are kept—c.g., Ains-
worth’s Novels are kept only in paper covers atis., or limp cloth gilt, ts. 6d.; Arm-
strong’s only in picture boards at 28., or half roman, 2s. 6d.
