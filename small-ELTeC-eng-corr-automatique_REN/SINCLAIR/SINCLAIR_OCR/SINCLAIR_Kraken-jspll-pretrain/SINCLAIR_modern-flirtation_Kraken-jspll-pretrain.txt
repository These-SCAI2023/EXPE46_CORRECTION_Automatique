UNDER PROPER.-`` Sir, the scene is set, and
everything ready to begin, if you please''
CrITIc.
IT was the rule of a celebrated eques-
trian, which might be adapted to authors
as well as to horsemen, that every one
should ride as if he expected to be
thrown, and drive as if he expected to be
upset. Impunity in publishing, far from
rendering an author presumptuous, should
tend rather to increase his timidity, the
danger being greater always of venturing
too much, than of hazarding too little;
and the more cause any writer has to
feel grateful for the lenient judgment of
an enlightened public, the more circus-
spect should he become, not to trespass

by an obtrusive reappearance on that
notice which has already perhaps been,
as in respect to the author herself, be-
bond all expectation favourable.
An old proverb declares that ``a goose-
quill is more powerful than a lion's claw,''
and authors have been called `` keepers
of the public conscience;'' but no influx-
ccc is perhaps so extensive as that ever-
cited by what is termed  light reading,''
which has now in a great measure super-
seed public places and theatrical enter-
tainments, affording a popular resource
with which the busiest men relax the
hard-working minds, and the illest oc-
cup their idleness. It becomes a deep
responsibility, therefore, of which the
author trusts she has ever felt duly sensi-
hle, to claim the leisure hours of so
many, while it is her first desire that
whatever be the defects of these pages,

pressed in the words of the poet,

Novel-reading, formerly considered the
lowest resource of intellectual vacuity,
has been lately promoted to a new place
in the literary world, since men of the
brightest genius as well as of the highest
attainments in learning and philosophy,
allow their pens occasionally to wander
in the attractive regions of fiction; there-

volumes minds, are now avowedly rend
and enjoyed, to beguile an idle hour, or
to cheer a gloomy one, by men of science,

general encouragement given now to

ence of authors depends on attracting
readers, there will scarcely be encourage-
ment enough soon to induce historians

and biographers to dip the pen of vera-
city into the ink of introspection, while
it is perhaps to be lamented that when
so large a proportion of the public attend-
tion is occupied by novelists, their works
being certain of instant circulation, for a
very short period and for no more, few
authors afford themselves time to aspire
at the highest grade of imaginary com-
position. When such volumes are really
true to nature, they convey very import-
tant truths in a form more popular than
a dry contentious volume of moral pre-
cents, and perhaps history itself can
scarcely afford so graphic a portrait of
human life as many of those fictitious
volumes, written under the inspiration
of genius, which portray in vivid colour-
in, the thoughts and motives by which
men are internally influenced.
The Life of Cleopatra, or the Memoirs
of Agrippina can afford scarcely so much
direction to young ladies respecting their

views of life and manners in the present
day, as might be conveyed by a judicial-
house-drawn portrait of that world as it
is, on the stage of which they are about
to be personally introduced; and a large
proportion of those elaborate volumes
dignified with the name of history, can
only be considered in the main fictitious,
because, while biographers would confi-
gently state the private opinions, secret
intentions, and real characters of illustri-
ous men who lived and acted several
hundred years ago, they cannot justly
estimate the actual dispositions and mo-
times of their own most intimate friends,
nor confidently point out what circus-
stances have influenced the greatest
events in their own day. If two authors,
entertaining opposite political sentiments,
were to write the history of last year,
every fact recorded, and every individual
mentioned must inevitably be represent-
ed, or misrepresented, according to the

writer's own private feelings, while each
would believe he was writing adultery-
rated truth.
Thus poetry and fiction, when true to
the principles of human life, exhibit the
mind and soul of man visibly to the
senses; and history, which has been call-
ed ' the Newgate Calendar of Kings and
Emperors,'' supplies the facts of human
existence, and may be considered a por-
trait of man's persons and external
actions.
In writing a story of domestic life, it
is singular to reflect how commonly men
are remembered by their eccentricities,
and loved for their very faults, while the
most difficult task in fiction is, to de-
scribe amiable persons so as to render
them at all interesting and not utterly
insipid. Probably it may be for this
reason that modern writers too frequent-
ly, instead of describing the principles
which ennoblo human nature, and the

sentiments which embollish life, have
painted in vivid colouring, all that is low,
mean, and vicious in society, introducing
their readers into scenes, the reality of
which would be shunned with abhor-
rence, and flinging over vice such a
mantle of genius as converts the decor-
cities of society into subjects of interest,
-unfortunately even of sympathy.
Were authors obliged hereafter, to live
with the characters they create, how few
would desire to share with them in such
a world Even where the intention is to
represent an attractive character, it sel-
dom appears as one which could be an
agreeable acquisition to any family circle;
and in works of sentiment or feeling, no-
thing is less successfully pictured than a
generous and refined attachment, fitted
to survive every trial or vicissitudes of
existence, between those who are to love
and to trust each other for ever. Few

romance acted with the slightest degree
of mutual confidence or esteem; but such
narratives are generally founded on a
teasing succession of narrow-minded sus-
actions and unwarrantable concealment
on the part of heroes and heroines, who
condemn each other unheard, and go
through volumes of heart-breaking alien-
nation, enough to terminate life itself
rather than as the most simple planar-

certain conviction in closing the last

justification; but the weight of censure
might become greatly lightened by being
more equitably divided among all who
are entitled to carry a share, and in
these volumes an endeavour is made to
rectify the balance more justly, though
with what success remains to be disco-
verde by the author herself, as not a
single friend ever sees her pages, or puts
on the spectacles of criticism till after
they are printed. The only peculiarity
to which she makes any pretension, in
once more presuming to publish, is, that
avoiding all caricature, all improbability,
and all personality, she has introduced a
few individuals acting and thinking in
the ordinary routine of every-day life,
while her highest ambition is to repre-

this influence of Christianity.

may perhaps be denominated an enlarged
religious tract in high life, the author
humbly submits her pages to the judge-

the words of a more universally venerat-

Day after day passed on, subsequent to
the preceding conversation, during' which Sir
Arthur frequently postponed his chop, to what
he considered an atrociously late hour, in
hopes of his promised guest appearing. Once
the admiral felt positively convinced that he
had seen him enter a Portobello omnibus at
four o'week, but still he appeared not. Week
after week elapsed, and still Sir Arthur ate
his dinner alone, in long-surviving expectation,
that either his own not very dutiful nephew,
or young De Crespigny, would `` cast up;'' but
at last these hopes and wishes were ended by
his hearing that Sir Patrick's embarrassments
had caused him to leave Edinburgh by moon-
light, and that, soon after, Mr De Crespigny
as suddenly departed, no one knew why, when,

ThE two most dashing, bold, and mischievous
boys at Eton during their day, had formerly
been Sir Patrick Dunbar and Louis de Crew-
piggy, who astonished the week minds of
masters and pupils, by the strange and start-
ling invention displayed in their exploits, as
well as by the ingenuity with which both got
safely out of every threatening predicament.
and the sly humour or cunning with which
they frequently shifted the disgrace, or even
the punishment, of their offenses, on others
who deserved it less, or perhaps not at all.
Invariably at the head of every mad exploit,

or at the bottom of every secret design, how
they could possibly have escaped being ex-
pulled as a frequent topic of subsequent
wonder among their contemporaries in the
classes; but their delight was to run as near
the wind as possible, and still to display their
skilful pilotago by baffling justice, and evading
the utmost rigour of the Law, while always
ready rather to do harm than to do nothing.
WHen very young, the two enterprising
friends, both since gazetted into the 15th
Light Hazards, had shown an early predilection
for military life, by frequently escaping to the
neighbouring barracks, assisted by a ladder
of rope on which they descended every night
from the windows. A. gay joyous reception
invariably awaited these lively boys at the
mess-table, where they sung many a jovial
song, and cracked many n merry jest over
their claret, till, after some hours spent in
rapturous festivity, they stole silently baek
within bounds, and were re-admitted at the
window, by their respective fags, who had re-
received orders, under pain of death, to keep

awake and answer their signals for the ladder
by instantly lowering it. The spirits of both
these young companions were more like the
effect of intoxication, than mere sober enjoy-
ment; and, on one occasion, they set the
table in a roar, by having a rivalship which
would best imitate the gradual progress of
becoming tipsy, though drinking nothing but
cold water; in which exhibition they showed so
much talent for mimiery, taking off the sur-
rounding officers before their faces, and mak-
in so many home-thrusts and personal re-
marks, that the scene was never afterwards
forgotten in the regiment. On another coca-
sion Sir Patrick caused himself to be placed
in a coffin, stolen from the undertakers, and
was carried through the barracks by his com-
anions, who made paper trumpets with which
they played the dead march in Saul, while all
the sentries saluted as they passed. Such
juvenile exploits in the dawn of life were now
the subject of many a laughing reminiscenee

where the two young men afterwards dustin-
guished themselves in a way not easily to be
forgotten, using their better disciplined
companions to wonder, though in very few in-
stances to admire.
In the favourite aristocratic achievements
of driving stage coaches, breaking laps
wringing off knockers, assaulting watchmen,
with other first and pugilistic exploits, they
were nearly unrivalled; and occasionally their
genius had soared into an extraordinary dis-
play of dexterity, in transposing the signs sus-
ended over shops, and in filching silk hand-
kerehiefs from the pockets of their friends,
merely as amateurs, but still the deed was
done, and the laugh raised literally at the ex-
sense of the sufferer, as the plunder was re-
trained to be a future trophy of success. Each
successive stage of their youth, in short, sup-
plied an inexhaustible fund of standing jests
and lively anecdotes, the wit of which mainly
consisted in their mischief, while they betray-
ed an utter recklessness about the opinions or

the feelings of others, till at length the path-
neo of their unfortunate private tutor was so
completely exhausted that he gave them a
secret hint to withdraw, which they accord-
singly lost no time in preparing to do, but not
till they had enjoyed a very characteristic
revenge. When Mr Brownlow had taken
party of friends with him one evening to the
theatre, Sir Patrick suddenly discharged from
the gallery the whole contents of a prodigious
bag of flour, which powdered all the heads,
fees, and coats, in the pit, perfectly white,
and caused an uproar of anger and of arrests-
title laughter throughout the house; and the
same evening Louis de Crespigny, as a fare-
well frolic, abstracted a stuffed bear from the
neighbouring hai-dresser's, and having equip-
pel it in the costume of Mr Brownlow, hung it
from the lamp-post, where a panic-struck crowd
was speedily assembled by the alarming report
that the reverend gentleman had committed
suicide. A strict investigation took place re-
setting the authors of these unpardonable
tricks, but, though suspicion fell at once upon

the real culprits, and the circumstantial evi-
deco against them seemed irresistibly strong,
Sir Patrick argued his own cause with so
much skiLl and vivacity, while De Crespigny
looked so innoeently unconscious of the whole
affair, that, with a silent frown from the mas-
ter, of stern reproof and suspicion, they were,
not honourably acquitted, but allowed to re-
turn home without any public murk of cen-
sure or disgrace; and soon after both joined
their regiment at Dublin.
De Crespigny and Sir Patrick had but one
companion whom they acknowledged as their
equal at Eton, in all the spirit, enterprise, and
vivscity of their characters, but who was, in a
thousand other respects, their superior, for
seldom, indeed, has there been known, in one
so young, a character of as much intensity, or
which displayed a combination so singular, of
superb talents, rare judgment, sound pain-
ciple, deep piety, and energetic feeling, as

anions. Cultivated in all that could adorn
the heart, as well as the head, in whatever
was amiable, high-spirited, and generous, Rich-
ard Granville had but to follow the impulse of
natural feeling as well as of principle, and he
out-did the very wishes of his friends, while
one excelled him in all the manly exercises
suited to his early years. His countenance
was illuminated with an expression of intellect-
dual energy, at times almost sublime, while
there was a living grace and capability in his
manner irresistibly attractive. Brave, liberal
and resolute, he entered with eagernoss into
all the inoffensive recreations of his compa-
unions, and no one recalled him in riding,
fencing, and cricket, while he was the best
shot in his own county; but he firmly de-

in hedging bets, and all the manoeuvres of

eloquence and affection could dictate, to point
out how dangerous and dishonourable was the
course on which he seemed about to enter,
but in vain, for Sir Patrick finished tho dis-

by their guardians, in which the interest of
all three were so deeply concerned, and the
case so exceedingly complicated, that years
passed on, during which the youths had all
grown to manhood, and the case remained
still undecided; while the one-sided view
which was given to Dunbar and Do Crespigny
on the subject caused in them an angry feel-

it is like a kitten playing with a ball of
worsted, which is allowed to come often ap-
patently within her grasp, and is then, when
the least expects, twitched away farther than
before. The Granville case had been decided
by the Court of Session, against the two cou-
sins, Dunbar and De Crespigny, but being ap-
appealed to the House of Lords, was recom-
mended for consideration, re-argued, re-eonsi-
dered, and nearly reversed, while replies and
supplies, emits and re-revivals, commissions of
inquiry, and new cases, followed each other in
ceaseless succession, and many.of the lawyers
who were young men when the case began,
grew grey in the service, while yet it remained
in suspense. A grand-uncle of Sir Patrick's
had fifty years before bought an estate of
L.12,000 a-year from the Marquis of Donbas-
ter, to whom young De Crespigny was now
heir-presumptive; but Mr Dunbar having, it
was conjectured, entertained some suspicion
that the title-deeds were not perfectly valid,

by which it was generally thought that the
land must be restored to the original owner,
he hastily and most unfairly sold the property
to the late Mr Granville for L.350,000, and
dying intestate, after having lost nearly the
whole sum in a mining speculation, it could
not be proved whether Sir Patrick's father
had acted as executor for the deceased or not,
so as to render himself responsible for his
debts, and liable to refund the sum paid by
Mr Granville. Thus, whether the entail held
good, and carried the estate baek to Lord
Doneaster, or whether it had been legally
broken, so as to monitor the Granville family
to keep it, or whether, if it wcro refunded, the
price could be claimed from the heirs of MIr
Dunbar, still continued a mystery never ap-
patently to be solved.

had ever did, till he left a substitute in rogue-
lar rotation, to supply the vacancy which he
created himself; and a long train of minorities
in the family had caused the accumulation of
wealth and property to be enormous, when
the present proprietor succeeded, fifty years
before our story commences. Nothing could
exceed his own astonishment at the embargo-
passed magnificence of the fortune, of which
he most unexpectedly found himself in pos-
session, as his father had been in the habit
of concealing the amount of his own income,
and allowing his heir rather less than nothing,
saying, that as he himself never had anything
to cut till he had no teeth to eat with, he was
resolved that his successor should be similarly
treated. In pursuant of this plan, the old
nobleman even on his death-bed, had actually
expired with a practical joke on his lips. He
sent for his son, gravely told him that with
debts, mortgages, and settlements, the very
encumbered estate he was about to inherit
would scarcely pay its own expenses, and re-

commended him to live in future with the
most penurious economy. When the will was
opened, finding to his unutterable joy, that he
had merely been played upon by the old hn-
moist, who in reality left him L.40,000 per an-
num clear, so great was Lord Doneasster's snr-
prise, that he declared his good fortune at the
time to be `` almost incredible;'' and it might
have been supposed, that he never afterwards
completely believed it, as his personal expenses
were always in a style more suited to the old
Lord's that than his performance, and he
became a fresh instance of what may be so of-

There was no singular peculiarity in the
settlements of Lord Doncaster's family, that
so long as he had no son, or if his son at
twenty-one declared himself a Protestant, he
had the power of selling or bequeathing the
estates according to his own pleasure or a-
price; and the ancestor who had inserted this
clause in his deed of entail, made his intention

evident, that the succession should go to the
woman Catholic Church, rather than to Pro-
testant heir; but the present peer had taken
advantage, on so large a scale, of his own
childless privilege, to sell the family estates,
that his two deceased sisters, Lady Charlotte
De Crespigny, and Lady Caroline Matheson,
used secretly to complain, that little would be
left for their children, if he persevered in
turning every aere into gold; yet no one over
could guess how the large sums were squad-
herod or melted away, which the old Marquis
was continually raising, unless they went,
as was strongly suspected, in the form of
`` secret service money,'' among the priests by
whom he was surrounded.
Nobody had a better right to be eccentric
than Lord Detonator -old, rich, unmarried,
and originally educated at home,-a minor-

men's motives and intentions, and yet con-
riding to the last extreme of weakness, in the
Abbe Mordaunt, his confessor, despising all
men, and not anxious beyond measure for the
world's good opinion, addicted to the very
worst female society, when he might have

he was least expected, jealous to chooses of
his next heir, Iouis De Crespigny, whom he
enslaved to his caprices, as if even his exist-
ence were to be given or withheld at hise

his manner to him, though ready to take for
in an instant if his condescension led the live-
ly youth into the slightest approach towards
confidence or familiarity.

a favourite day-dream with the old peer, that
his nephew and niece should be educated for
each other, while to this end he tried his ut-
most power of conciliation with the maiden
sister of Mr Howard Matheson, to whose
care the young heiress had been consigned,
hoping that thus all the amputated limbs of
his vast property might yet be reunited in
their pristine magnitude, to which very de-
sizable end he thenceforth directed his whole
conversations with young De Crespigny, to
whom he more than hinted that, unless their
will were the same about this marriage, his
own will after death would be found very if-
ferent from what his nephew probably antici-
dated and wished.

liberality. Wearied of the world, in which he
had nothing more to desire, and of himself, as
he had nothing to think of or to do,-bored in
short with the want of a want, Lord Donbas-
ter's life was indeed a mere heartless pageant
of mean ostentation and fretful pride, sternly
insulated in a state of solitary old-bachelor
despotism, and absorbed in himself to a degree
which no ordinary mind could conceive or
comprehend. Eneumbered with so many un-
occupied hours, it was a subject of as much
wonder how he disposed of his superfluous
time, as of his superfluous fortune; but he set-
toed that question, by remarking one day to
his nephew, that `` the great business of life
is, to shuffle through the day anyhow till din-
er time.'' Like all pnrsimonious men, Lord
Doncaster could not endure to her any one

In the month of August, as regularly as time

known to attempt, in which he prohibited
poachers and strangers from shooting on his
moors in Argyleshire, Mid-Lothian, Yorkshire,
Galloway, Rosemary, and Caithness, but except

encouraged by his public spirit,-and the mo-
uments daily arising in memory of departed
merit, made a vain appeal for his pecuniary
tribute of respect and regret, for Lord Donbas-
ter neither restored nor regretted any man.
It was an often-repeated axiom of Lord Don-
caster's, that every man cheats or is cheated;
but in one instance, and one only, his Lordship
had shown apparently some kind feeling, or
other perhaps he might be said to have oxhi-
cited a capricious freak of benevolence, though
the result had been such as to afford him an
excuse ever afterwards for not again attempt-

of her brother Ernest, bore witness to the
anger and grief with which they listened to
his bitter and often unmorited upbraidings.
At times, however, Lord Doneaster found it
convenient for his own private purposes to pa-
tronize the Anstruthers, and threatened, in the
hearing of all his young relatives, that if Louie
De Crespigny's conduct did not in all respects
satisfy him, an heir more subservient to his
wishes might be found, and though the culprit
must be his nephew, he need not be his sucees-

impression on the young and ambitious minds
of those usually neglected children. The
child becomes a boy, the boy a youth, and
then the game of life begins in earnest,''
WIthout education or principle, and with
no friend on the wide earth to confide in or to

that will yet flourish though trampled upon,
grew up vigorous in body, and enthusiastically
as well as devotedly attached to each other,
with a depth and power of affection which ap-
feared, before long, the only redeeming gun-
city in characters wherein strong passions and
week principles promised little, and threat-
ened much, to all with whom they might
hereafter become associated.

brillancy in the eye of Ernest, expressive of a
fiery impetuosity, amounting at times almost
to an appearance of insanity, when, after be-
ing obliged to crouch and flatter for his head
before Lord Doncaster, he would retiro with
Mary, and give loose to all the angry torrent
of his long-suppressed emotions. The sister's
heart covered sometimes before the flood of
nineties and implications with which he re-

that fortune herself had shown him a most

it seemed sometimes as if he would put his
mind into a pugilistie attitude, and buffet his
way forward to pre-eminence in spite of all the
malice of fortune and of mankind. With a
temper vindictive, harsh, and deadly, his blood
mounted like mercury in a thermometer at the
very thought of suecese, and often when he
spoke to his sister in the lowest whisper of
their future prospects, she would start and
look hastily round as if in terror, lest the wild
dreams of his undisciplined mind might be
overheard and resented, for he nourished a
feerish hope, which he called a prosentiment,
but which amounted almost to a monte-matta,
that the splendid residence in which they were
now only tolerated on sufferance, `` as reptile

Time had ripened the faults of the two

whim as sudden, and apparently as accounts-

or rather the Abbe Mordaunt, unexpectedly
to announce that they were dismissed from
the house. Various rumours were circulated
among the servants to account for this harsh
and hasty decision, but nothing would be his-
beloved for certain. Ernest was reported to
have expressed himself with the greatest ran-
coeur and contempt respecting a report in eir-
culation, that Lord Doneaster intended to
marry the Abbe Mordaunt's beautiful ieee,
then on a visit at Kilmarnoek Abbey, near

declared that Louis De Crespigny's assiduities
to Mary Anstruther had recently become a-

her character; but whatever might be the
cause, they were both hastily transferred on a

stamped on their young faces, when the Abb

sum of money in their hands, which the young

trampled upon, saying in accents of strong and

From that day forward the names of Mary
and Ernest Anstruther never passed the lips
of Lord Doneaster or the Abbe, who ordered
the servants also to abstain from ever men-

of the second table into greater activity than
ever; but though many vague conjectures,
dark suspicions, and absurd rumours, wore
promulgated throughout the establishment,

ITs Info of Louis De Crespigny, from the
hour he entered the army, was one continued
steeple-chase after pleasure and amusement,
in whatever form they could be courted, or at
whatever expense they could be enjoyed. At
a very early age, he was already a veteran in
the world and its ways; for he stood `` alone
in his glory,'' the most admired, courted, and
idolized of mankind, a perfect adept in all the
arts of rendering himself agreeable in society,
and possessing many pleasant qualities, but
none that were valuable. During a gay career
of dissipation and frivolity, he had entered

with successive eagerness on a thousand flirt-
tions, though he always forgot to marry in the
end, while his heart, like a phnix, was fre-
quietly consumed, yet never destroyed, and
always ready at the service of any young lady,
with youth, beauty, and accomplishments
enough to excite his temporary interest. Being
of opinion, that, though not yet a peer, he
ought speedily to be one, young De Crespigny
openly avowed the impossibility of marrying
while Lord Doneaster survived, and joeularly
remarked, that it would be a pity prematurely
to out of the hopes of his hundred and ono
Scotch cousins, who lived, like Ernst An-
struther, on the hope, that if his necks were
broken at Melton, his succession might yet be
``cut up'' amongst them; and to the friendly
inquiries of his many relatives, he frequently
replied with a condoling look, that he and his
uncle were both ``' hopelessly well,'

ship.'' And certainly he had become of late
years more particular thun ever.
One personage only seemed to have the art
of doing no wrong in the estimation of Lord
Doncaster; and the respect which he withheld
from all mankind, was concentrated to an im-
measurable degree on the Abbey Mordsunt,
who was the Cardinal Wolsey of IKilmarnoek
Abbey and Beaulieu Castle. Proud, over-
bearing, harsh, and arbitrary, he ruled over
the house, the purse, and even the will of his
patron, with despotic and unlimited sway. Men
are generally advanced in years before the
passions and feelings have stamped their in-
delible traces, like the impression of a seal,
which becomes permanent only after the war
has begun to cool; but in every feature of the
Bbc's countenance, might now be seen the
evidences of a gloomy, severe, and almost zero-
pious temper, yet never was there a greater
triumph of art over nature, than in the skill
with which he adapted his looks and converse-
tion to the taste or caprice of those whom it

was his interest to govern, and the astonishing
facility with which he could call up a bland
smile and insinuating voice, to supersede the
habitual haughtinoess of his tone and manner.
Educated at St Omers, in all the dark su-
partitions of that bigoted college, the Abb
was nevertheless far from desiring to seek
within the walls of a cloister any protection
from those temptations to worldly indulgence,
which he had not even a wish to resist. He
neither preached nor practised the virtues of
his vocation, bnt paraded a whole troop of
vices openly in the public eye; and far from
seeking to reform mankind, he never attempt-
cd even to reform himself. Though in person-
nal appearance of distinguished ugliness, yet
such was the magic of his manner, that even
by ladies he was considered perfectly ire-
possible; and to all, whether old or young, he
generally succeeded in imparting a conviction,
that he saw in her, for the first time, a realize-
tion of female perfection and female fascina-
tion. The Abbey was never known to stop

After having recklessly squandered, in a
career of almost startling dissipation, the whole
of his own patrimony, it was believed that he
had obtained fraudulent possession of 10,000
belonging to his very beautiful niece, to whom
he must have refunded it had she lived to come
of age, or had she married it must have been
restored to her children, but about the time
our story commences, she was supposed either
to have died, or to have retired to a convent
abroad, though whether upon conviction or
not, might be considered very doubtful, as she
had been educated by her mother in the Pro-
testant faith, and it was generally conjectured
that to so sudden and entire a removal from
all former connections, her poverty more than
her will must have consented. Laura Mor-
aunt had resided much at lilmarnoek Abbey

and blindly attached, but the gossiping world
sometimes conjectured that perhaps the evident
partiality and admiration of Lord Doncaster
might have roused in her some ambitious
thoughts, backed by the influence of the Bbc.
Among the peculiarities of the Marquis he
had always professed a decided contempt for
all respectable ladies, and therefore his attend-
tions to Laura MIordant were at best a very
questionable compliment, and became latterly
of a nature which few relatives would have
wished to encourage, yet Miss Mordaunt still
remained a guest at Kilmarnoek Abbey, till the
period of her sudden disappearance, which
caused so much astonishment among hcr inti-
mato friends and ncar connections, that the fa-
thor of diehard Granville, her cousin, shortly
before his own death, wrote an affectionate lct-

than to find how much was known in Edin-

and character of the present Lord Doneastcr,
though he lived not only secluded from society,
but made it his peculiar study to evade the
scrutiny of impcrtinont curiosity, and was so
anxious to check the loquaciousness of servants,
that his butler and housekeeper had street or-

the establishment, and not allow a word to

straight-forward pursuit of what he thought
right in all his actions, which gave him a sin-
gulag influence over the affections and the
conduct of those with whom he wished to as
sociate, and the admirable use he made of
which no one afterwards ever had cause to
regret. His early life had boron one full of
action and of vigorous exertion, seeking, with
old-fashioned patriotism, the honour of his
country, more than the promotion of his own
interests; but in advanced years, when no

he directed his time and talents to the diff-
sion of happiness at home, and to a zealous,
diligent, and humble preparation for that long
and quick home to which he believed himself
rapidly approaching, and which he eontem-
plated  with the best of all philosophy,-that
of a truly devoted Christian.
WIth all the blunt frankness of his sailor-
like manner, Sir Arthur could nevertheless
testify an almost feminine gentleness and sym-
partly towards the unfortunate. He was often
discovered to have exerted clandestinely, a
degree of activity and zeal in serving the most
needy and desolate, which, to a mind less
eager and generous, would have seemed almost
incredible,-he never lacerated the feelings of
those who came to him for comfort, by at-
tempting to convince the sufferer, as most
people begin by doing, on such occasions, that
the misfortune, whatever it be, is all his own
fault,-and he was quite as ready, as well as
much better pleased, to rejoice with those

With a good-humoured smile at his own
credulity in having believed that Louis De
Crespigny could ever be serious in proposing
to sacrifice a day of his gay and busy life, to
a posing tete-h-tete on the sea-beach with an
old man like himself, Sir Arthur dismissed the
subject from his thoughts, and finally resin-
quashed all hope of seeing his young friend,
after a short soliloquy, in which he ended, by
slyly hoping that the gay Cornet would never
cause those who might feel it more, to regret
his having jilted them.
Not many days following, the Admiral had
retired at his usual early hour to bed, and
after some time passed in profound repose, he
was suddenly startled into wakofulness at the
lawn of day, while the watchman was calling

the sharp, shrill tone of a woman in the agony

every repetition of the era, while Sir Arthur
pressed with the rapidity of a practised sea-

his maid-of-all-work, and his man-of-all-work,
already assembled in breathless consternation
round a trembling, terrified-looking servant

and precipitately entered the nearest room he
could find. Thore he paused for a moment
on finding himself in a splendid-furnished
bed-room, adorned with a degree of taste and
elegance, far expelling what was customary in
so obscure-looking a lodging, and the Admiral
was about hastily to withdraw, when he be-
come suddenly transfixed to the spot, and his
eye seemed perfectly blasted by the spectacle
which met his agitated and astonished gaze,
while several moments elapsed before he had
nerve to advance, and ascertain the reality of
a scene, which filled him with horror.
On a magnificent couch, the rich convert
of which was drenched in blood, that had
sprinkled the floor, and spouted to the very
roof of the room, lay the cold stiffened corpse
of a young female, whose head seemed to have
been nearly severed from her body, while a
violent contusion appeared upon her forehead.

by Sir Arthur, the child, who appeared to be
of wondrous beauty, opened for a moment, a
pair of bright blue, star-like eyes, and with a
cry of terror, called for his mother, but a
moment afterwards, overcome by irresistible
drowsiness, his rosy cheek dropped upon the
pillow, his heavy eyes were closed, and to re
lapsed into the same strange, mysterious in-
sensibility as before.
It was a fearful sight, that young mother,
with her look of ghastly agony turned towards
the ruddy healthful countenanee of her child
in his peaceful slumbors, and it was evident
that her last thought had been for him, as his
clothes were still conclusively held in her left
hand, while a vain attempt had obviously been
made to tear them asunder,-many deep cuts
being visible on the child's night-gown, though
his person had been left uninjured.
Sir Arthur compassionately snatched the
boy up in his arms, to hurry him away from
the dreadful scene, and called the watchman,

violently forcing his way out; but no other
sign appeared of the room having been in-
painted. Not an article of clothing could
be found in the drawers; not a book or a
paper; and the search was about to be ann-
done, when Sir Arthur perceived in an ol-
sure corner of the room, a man's glove,
stained with blood, and a red silk hander-
chief, from which the initials had evidently
been erased with great care, though he hoped
that some one more accustomed to such in-

them.

though the party which accompanied in

rushed forward, all gazing eagerly around, as
if they expected an immediate denouement of
the mystery to take place; but some of those
who were foremost shrunk back in astonish-

his end, with a look of anxiety and alarm,

her very lips were blanched, and her voice
sounded husky and hollow with agitation:
but all this might be attributed to so sudden

she asked with quivering accents, whether any
accident had occurred, and why they all ap-

unequivocal terror, and hiding his face on the
shoulder of Sir Arthur, he sobbed aloud with
a degree of passionate grief and agitation,

In an instant she snatched off her night-

an expression of livid horror, and unnatural

ghastly smile; but the boy struggled more
vehemently than before, and clung to Sir
Arthur with a tenacity and confidence, which
deeply touched the old veteran's heart, who
tried to soothe the terrified child by every en-
department which his kind nature would sue-
gest, while his attention was nevertheless en-
chained by observing the rigid, marble look
of the young woman's countenance; the drag-

over her features, as if she had suffered a
stroke of paralysis.

There was something fearful and appalling
in the silence which reigned among the many
parsons who had gathered around, when A-
rah, as a prisoner, was led into the chamber
of death. A look of shuddering horror dis-
touted for a moment, her pale and haggard
countenance, when she was unwillingly drawn
forward to the place where her deceased mis-
tress lay, and Sir Arthur with silent sole-
city, pointed to the ghastly spectacle. His
eyes were intensely and most mournful fixed

Sarah appeared neither startled nor auto-

a cold stony block of almost preternatural
calmness, sho muttered to herself in a low
tone, which became nevertheless distinctly
audible to all the spectators, and was evidently
meant to be heard,-

replied Sarah, hurriedly. `` She has destroy-

plied Sir Arthur, scanning the expression of
her fixed, and apparently unalterable features.

that she should be married to bed; but before
she left the room, anxious if possible to eluci-
date the mystery, and to gain some clue for
pursuing the actual murderer, he detained
Sarah during a moment, and desired that a
glass of water might be brought for her, hop-
in that the violent emotion she had betrayed
might lead her to a full confession. Laying
his hand then upon her arm, in tones of deep
and awful solemnity, he looked at her, and
pointed once more to the corpse, saying,--

Not a word or a look gave evidence that
Sarah so much as heard Sir Arthur speak.
Her largo eyes were vacant fixed on the
ground, her hands were firmly clenched, and
her teeth were set with an air of resolute de-
termination, when, after a pioneer of several
minutes, during which for very stillness was
rightful, supported by some of the strangers
around, she walked with almost mechanical
consciousness out of the room.
Again and again the house was searched
that day-the very floors and wainscots torn
up; but not a trace could be discovered to
throw light upon the cause or cireumstaneee
of this disastrous event; and equally remark-
able was it, that no hint would be obtained of
who or what the murdered lady had been.
MODERN FLIRIATIONSI 95
There were books on the table in various lan-
guards, but not one retained any name writ-
ten on the boards, though it was evident that
on some a coat of arms had once been pasted,
and subsequently defaced. Not a letter or
per could be found with either signature or
direction, though one or two notes were dis-
covered beneath the pillow of the bed, all
anonymous, but written in a similar hand,
and containing nothing that could identify
the writer; and several sketches of the child,
beautifully executed in various attitudes, were
found in a portfolio, beside which were writ-
ten many simple verses, containing the most
fervent expressions of tender affection and
anxious solitude for the boy, and the most
passionate bursts of melancholy, but nll con-
received in general terms, which baffled the re-
searches of curiosity.
This hand is disguised, yet surely I have
seen it boforo,'' said Sir Arthur, musingly ex-
mining the anonymous notes, which related
chiefly to remittances of money. ` The fao

already, or is this only the delusion of an cx-
cited mind These deep and prominent eye-

peneilled eye-brows-and that mouth of por-
fect grace and beauty, which seems still
lost to speak without a tongue, in the lan-
gauge of heart-broken misery, telling of de-
received affections-of blighted hopes-of un-
pitied and solitary tours.''
Sir Arthur seated himself on a chair beside
the couch for some moments in agitated ro-
election, vainly endeavouring to collect his
thoughts, and form them into some tangible
remembrance. " It is a strange und bewil-
during sensation, to look at the muto features
of this death-like image, and to feel as if once

youth and bloom. A vague harassing per-

Sir Arthur wearied himself with intense
efforts to identify the lineamente before him,
but in vain. They. were lovely indeed., and
many a stranger came likewise to try whether
they would be recognized, but without success.
The fearful story circulated like wild-fire-the
excitement and curiosity it produced became
intense; but not a gleam of light was thrown
upon the dark and mysterious event.
Among the many who hurried to behold
the murdered woman before her remains were
disturbed, two gentlemen arrived one evening
after dusk, and having ascertained that nei-

tied up stairs, and remained in the room
alone for several minutes. Both wore much
muffled up, and evidently avoided any seru-

greatly agitated on leaving the room; and as
they hastened past Martin, and threw them-
selves into a hackney enoch which awaited
them at some distance, one of the party had
appeared so overcome, that he could not
walk without support. Much conjecture was
aroused by this incident, which doomed to in-

the melancholy circumstances, and not a
doubt could be entertained that these runtime--

truth and justice. Much as he had formerly
bemoaned the trouble entailed upon him by
deceased friends, many of whom had to-
bequeath their estates and children to his
guardianship, he felt on this occasion, a pity
so intense, for the nameless, friendless, and
helpless boy, thus unexpectedly and tragically
thrown on his compassion, that he publicly
pledged himself to harbour and protect the
child in the mean time, trusting that some
connections might at last be found, to whom
he more naturally belonged.  Life has had a
mournful commencement for him, poor boy!
His days are dark, and his friends are few,''
said Sir Arthur, with a strong emotion of
pity, `` but we must hope the best hereafter,
and do the best that can be done in the mean
time, trusting that a wise Providence, who
east him on my care and kindness, will also
watch over his futuro welfare,''
On the night previous to that appointed by
Sir Arthur for committing to the grave the
last remains of the murdered lady, he who
had so often faced death in every form, and

``lie'd the mouth of a cannon in battle,'' yet
felt himself awad and deeply affected in con-
attempting the solemn preparations for com-
sitting to the tomb one so young, so deeply
injured, and so apparently lamented. It
was with mournful and mysterious wonder
that he stood beside the corpse, and conte-
plated that mortal frame, from which the
spirit had been so suddenly and so cruelly
driven; and he could not but imagine the
scenes of love and joy which those eyes had
once probably looked upon-the busy thoughts
that had hurried through that lifeless heal-
the warm affections that had flowed through
that heart, now for ever at rest.
While yet his mind was dwelling with pain-
fil interest on all the thoughts which crowded
through his fancy, Martin hastily entered the
room, and in an agitated voice requested Sir
Arthur's immediate presence in the entrance-
hall, as some persons were there who had or-
ders to communicate only with himself.
On arriving in the passage, Sir Arthur was

Sir Arthur hastily tore open the letter

He was astonished; and solemn as the octet-
sion was, almost amused to observe that his
name and direction had been carefully cut
out of the newspaper paragraph which he
quarrelled with some weeks before at the
Club, and that this unknown correspondent,
to prevent the possibility of his writing being
detected by those who examined the outside,
had pasted these printed letters on the cover,

packet was sealed with a plain impression on

border; and there was an evident tremulous-
ness in the pen which had inscribed these

death. She disgraced his name, and alan-
done his house; nevertheless her child may
one day, perhaps, be acknowledged; and the
whole expenses of his education shall be like-

It was a strange, cold, heartless commnnni-
cation from a parent, without one expression
of relenting affection, one word of solitude
for his happiness, or one expression of grati-
tude to Sir Arthur for taking upon himself so
arduous a charge; but still it was to a car-

THE day of trial at length arrived, and the

During the legal investigation, which was

and a vain attempt had evidently been made
to snatch away a gold chain hung round
her neck, to which was appended a small bro-

cold and hard as Siberian icc, she persisted in
professing her own perfect innocence, and her
utter unconsciousness of anything that might
by possibility lead to a discovery of the per-
operator. She boldly, and almost calmly,

Nothing apparently touched the feelings of
Sarah Davenport, except when a suspicion
seemed to be implied that she wished to in-

her hands, and burst into tears, saying, in a-

fully put, to draw out his recollections of past
times, and especially the dark history of the
last few weeks. He was at first shy and in-
estimated, but gradually regained an unex-
pelted degree of self-possession, and spoke
with surprising intelligence and distinctness
of all he remembered.
The boy retained a faint recollection of
having been awakened, on the night of the
murder, by some violent scene of strife and
horror; but his faculties had evidently been
so bombed by opiates, that no distinct im-
prcssion remained; and to his own young
and, the whole seemed like a fearful dream,
too dreadful to look back upon even yet, ex-
kept with bewildering terror. He gave a
clear account, however, of the last evening
he had passed with his mother, of whom he
spoke in accents of infantile affection, evi-
gently unable yet to conceive that he should
see her face no more.
An old gentleman, he said, had come into
the room, and spoken angrily to her; while,

with astonishing precision, the boy acted over
the whole scene, recapitulated some of the
language they had used, and described how
his mother had clung to him with frantic
eagernese, saying she would promise any-
thing, if she might only retain her child;
how the stranger, who was very tall, and
wore a black coat, had spoken again with
angry vehemenee before he left the room;
and how his mother, when alone, had prayed
nd wept over him with looks of agonized
and desolate gif, until he had been carried
away to be by the maid, who administered
some medicine to him, which she said the
doctor had ordered.
Ho spoke much also of a large old room
hung with pictures, in which his earliest
lays had been passed, and of a small dark
apartment close beside it, into which he
had often been precipitately hurried, app-
gently for concealment, and where toys and
swectmeats had been always provided to keep
him quiet, while he was punished with the
utmost severity, for making the slightest

of apprehension, the gentleman dressed in
black, who most frequently visited him there,
and often caused his mother to weep bit-
terry.
Sarah Davenport was then recalled, and
rigidly cross-examined, respecting the gentle-
man who had visited at the house; but she
doggedly asserted her entire ignorance re-
speeding his rank in life, or connections, and
pertinaciously maintained that the Lady'
death had been her own voluntary act, and
that the sleeping potion had been given to
the boy by his mother's own imperative or-
ders, as she did not herself know even what
it contained.
During a long and anxious consultation of
the jury, there was a hushed and intense si-
fence in the crowded court, so still and un-
broken, that the breathing of an infant would
have been audible, while every eye perused
the countenanee of the prisoner, with an in-
density that brought a hectic flush, burning
like fire, upon her cheek, and she gazed

her beauty for the moment to look like that
of a friend or a fury.
At length, after variously scrutinising every
atom of evidence that would be gathered, the
jury, though morally certain of the prisoner's
being an accomplice in the crime, felt unwell-
singly obliged to bring in a verdict of`' not

and many crowded at first, with a tempo-

strangely bereaved, and so cruelly abandon-
ed; but the interest and excitement of her-
in and relating his story were soon super-

or small, are speedily hurried into one com-

concerns.
Every one of the Admiral's friends hinted
that he could have managed the whole affair
ten times better than Sir Arthur; all blame-
ed him for many things, and praised him
for very few; the Admiral was wondered at,
criticised, discussed, admired, pitied, and cen-
surged, more than he remembered to have been
for many years before; and the rivers of a-
vice were lavish of propositions and objee-
tions, all which were bone by their venerable
friend with good-humoured indifference, the-
the adopted or not. At length several per-
feetly new murders from London came on the
tapis in society; those who liked riding in
the Jack Sheppard style were satiated with
studies from the life; the Morning Post as-
sued a terrifying interest; and the lady of
fashion who consulted Sir Henry Halford
about her appetite, boeause she could no
longer enjoy her murders and robberies at
breakfast, would have thought, when they
were coming out hot and hot every week, that

it was a wearisome repetition to speculate an-
other hour upon a murder nearly a month old.
In short, `" the Portobello story'' ceased
to be told or listened to. Henry had had his
day. There is no such thing now as a nine
days' wonder, because nothing lasts so long.
Young De Plane had been talked of as munch
as any reasonable boing could expect to he

bore whenever the subject occurred in con

startling affair; but all stories should he al-

When Henry De Plane lost one parent, he
certainly gained another in Sir Arthur, who
often afterwards remarked, that in no instance
would virtue be more obviously its own re-
ward, than in the case of any kindness he had
shown to this fascinating boy, whose gay joy-

raster, however, and natural integrity of mind,
which Sir Arthur was delighted from the first
to remark, yet, when the merry group of
young friends assembled together on the
shore at Portobello, building houses of sand,
or running eagerly in search of shells, it would
have been difficult to say which was the most
carelessly happy, while the Admiral seemed
to borrow their young spirits for the time,
and gazed with eeaseless delight on those
joyous countenanees, radiant with laughter
and smiles, which were archly turned towards
their aged playmate, sometimes with a chal-
lange to run after them, or lighted up with
smiles of affection when they brought him a
bouquet of his favourite flowers, torn roughly
from the stems, and crushed and crumpled in
their little hands.
Sir Arthur often seemed almost ashamed
to betray the engrossing interest and delight
he felt in his young companion, who gained
every day a stronger hold upon his affections,
and it appeared as if he were anxious to for-
get that a time had ever existed when the

his heart; but a circumstance occurred, not
long after Henry's adoption, which brought
painfully to mind, with greatly increased soli-
cities, the fearful mystery that hung over his
origin, proving also that danger still threaten-
ed him from some unforeseen quarter.
While the whole party of his young guests
were noisily engaged on the shore in a game
at hide-and-seek, one day in the month of
July, Sir Arthur had seated himself on a
bench within sight of them, sometimes watch-
in their symbols with pleasure, and frequent-
ly conning over a newspaper, which proved by
undeniable and satisfactory demonstration,
that the country was entirely ruined-that
the Government was coming to an end-that
the Houses of Lords and Commons would be
completely demolished-that the ministry had
not another day to exist-and, as a grand
climax, that anarchy, confusion, bankruptcy.
and revolution, were about finally to drop
their extinguisher over Great Britain. Sir

odor grew, how a constitution so missa-
named could so long survive, and that when
all was wrong at the head of the country, it
still has a leg to stand on. The Admiral's
patriotic meditations had been several times
interrupted by repeated complaints from the

they could not possibly find him; but he was
too much pre-occupied to give the subject
much attention, till at length Martin an-
mounted that the children's dinner had waited
some time, and that still the boy was not to
be found, though his companions had been
searching for him at least half an hour.
Upon hearing this, Sir Arthur hastily
started up, making a considerable expend-
ture of energetic and wondrous exelamations,
while he gazed around with increasing sur-
prise at the wide waste of sand, like an Ara-
bian desert, with which he was on every side
encompassed, and where it seemed to him as
if a mouse would not be long concealed.

A hasty and most anxious search was in-
distant commenced in the garden, while Sir
Arthur and Martin shouted the name of
Henry at the full pitch of their voices, but in
vain; not a sound was heard in reply, nor
was there a spot unoxamined in which he
could by possibility be lurking.
The Admiral now became seriously alarmed
at so unaceountable a disappearance, especial-
ly when the child's gardening tools, with which
he had been last observed, were found muti-
later and broken, at a great distance, on the
beach-one of his shoes had fallen off eloso to
the water-and his hat lay nearly buried in
the tide. Sir Arthur instantly summoned the
police to his aid, but the search continued
fruitless, till at length the dreadful conjecture
became more and more probable, that Henry
must have rashly ventured into the water,
and been washed away by the waves-in pur-
stance of which apprehension Sir Arthur
summoned more assistance, that the water
might instantly be dragged.
120  MODErN LIRTATIONS.
Martin, meantime, no less active than his
master, had accidentally met a stranger on
the beach, who mentioned, on hearing of his
alarm, that on the road to Leith, half an hour
before, he had observed a boy struggling and
screaming in the arms of a female, dressed
like a nursery-maid, who complained loudly
that the child would not go home, when a
young man, rather strangely dressed, and of
very singular appearance, had instantly offer-
od lis assistance, and carried him forcibly on-
wards. This gentleman sail ho had stopped
the woman to remonstrate with her on using
the boy so roughly, as a cap was drawn over
his eyes, and ho seemed to suffer agonies of
terror, sobbing conclusively, and trembling in
every limb; but the man had answered in
reply, with a strong Irish accent, that he
would see the child safe to his friends, and let
no one to the poor boy `` a taste of harm.''

would not trust either of them with his dog
for an hour, to use it kindly.
WIthout wasting time in returning to com-
indicate what he had heard, Martin hurried
forward to Leith, where, with reckless speed
and hunting diligence, ho threaded all the
narrow streets, and olbowed his way among
earth, carriages, parcels, and passengers, till
at length he reached the pier, to which he
had been so eagerly aiming his steps. At its
farthest point stood a smoking steam-boat in
full boil, while men and women, boxes, paek-

was rung, to summon stragglers on board,
and to hurry stragglers away.
A single plank, connecting the steam-boat
with the pier, was on the point of being with-
drawn, when Martin approached; and while
he paused, in momentary hesitation whether
to pursue his almost hopeless search, the
steward peremptorily desired him to hasten

as not a moment more could be lost.
At this moment a or, almost amounting
to a serene of childish joy, became audible on
the deck-a young boy was seen vehemently
struggling in the arms of a female; and in an
instant, pursued by a man who vainly ended-
toured to overtake him, he rushed past the
steward, ran across the temporary bridge, and
clasped MArtin round the knees, exclaiming,
with eager incoherent exelamations of almost
hysterical delight,  `` Take me, Martial take

The boy put his hand, with an air of happy
confidence and security, into that of Martin,
who animated him. up in his arms, with a
thousand expressions of joyful surprise; but
a moment afterwards, when he, recolleeted
himself, his first impulse was to secure the
culprits who had decayed Henry away, and
to deliver them up to a magistrate for exams-
nation. With this intention, he looked has-
tiny round, intending to cause their immediate
apprehension; but the steam-boat had sailed
off; and called gesticulationas he could make
to bring them back, only caused the steward
laughingly to shake his head, thinking that
Martin had merely missed his passage, as he
deserved, for not showing more alaority in
obeying his injunctions to embark.
At Portobello, meantime, Sir  Arthur had
suffered agonies of grief, and even of self-re-
approach, thinking he had too securely relied
on the safety of his young protege; and with
a heavy heart he was.still directing his steps,

ing already ordered his said to have every
thing in readiness, in case a chance remained
of his being restored to life, when he felt a
gentle pull at the skirt of his coat, and, on
looking down, he uttered a volley of joyful
exclamations, on bcholding the radiant coun-
tenancy of HEnry, whom he leased in his
arms with unutterable joy. While Martin
and the boy himself, gao each his own his-
story of the strange adventure, Sir Arthur
walked up and down in a state of repression-
ble irritation, clenehing his teeth, and grasp-
in his walking-stick firmly in his hand, as if
about to wreak instant vengeance on the mis-
current. At length, after exhausting his in-
inflation, he took Henry again in his arms,
declaring he would never for a moment lose
sight of him aguia.
Nothing in Henry's narrative threw the
smallest gleam of light on the plans or intel-
tions of the strange man and woman, which
seemed destined toremain buried in impede-
table obscurity. They had evidently been
accomplices in decoding him from home; and

the boy had brought away from the steam-
boat, a small book which they had given
him, full of ribald songs, and profane jests,
but covered with magnificent boards, and
clasped with silver hinges, which seemed to
have once belonged to some ancient missal,
and still retained in the inside, a collection of
texts beautifully written in a very remarkable
hand, which seemed to be that of a highly-
educated female.
For some time afterwards, several status-
ious-looking people were seen lurking about
Sir Arthur'as premises, late at night; and one
evening a shot was fired suddenly in at the
drawing-room window, which passed so near
to Henry's head, that his hair was actually
disturbed; but though an active police had
been placed on the watch, not a trace could
be obtained of the authors of this outrage.

rapidly expanded on all subjects of classical
learning and general science, the fearful and
melancholy events of his early years faded
considerably from his mind, while he made

where Sir Arthur placed him, exhibiting that
happy, but rare combination of deep thought,
and refinement of mind, with extreme lively-

more and more intolerable as his eyesight

Sir Arthur often remarked to his friend,
.Lady Towereliffe, that it is a misfortune to
wear out a taste for any inoffensive occupy-
tion; and he began to fear it might be pos-
bible for him to survive his enjoyment of
reading. `` In my long Life,' he observed,
I have myself travelled all the travels de-
scribed by others, thought all the thoughts,

book as Robertson's America, for instance,

my own identity in reading the story.''

No sooner had Sir Arthur mentioned in-
accidental, to Lady Towereliffe, and several
friends, that he would willingly gio a hand-
some salary to a person of good reading and
writing abilitieS, than it seemed as if all the
meritorious young men in Scotland happened
at that very time to be looking out for pre-
wisely such a situation; and it made In
Arthur almost melancholy in examining tes-
nationals, which ought to have procured
any one of them a bishopric, to think that
so many admirable youths, of learning and
talents, were ready to sacrifice themselves

No situation ever became vacant in the
memory of man, for which Lady Toereliffe
had not some protege exactly sited; and no
sooner did she hear that Sir Arthur required
a secretary and reader, than she wrote him a
note of seven pages, closely penned, in which
she made it evident that there was but one
individual in the world who could suit, or
ought to suit, and that one individual was
the bearer of her despateh, who waited below
for an answer.
It appeared that, with all her zeal in the
cause, Lady Towereliffe knew very little of
the young man she so vehemently reem-
mended; bnt having accidentally met him in
a bookseller's shop, he had been employed by
her to copy some veres in an album, and she

It was a favourite saying with Sir Arthur,
that he would be more ashamed to suspect
mankind, than to be deceived by them; and
if he had a weakness in the world, it was a
total incapacity to gie pain. Touched by
the nervous excitement in Mr Howard's eye
and manner, which he attributed entirely to
his necessities oiroumstanees, he almost im-
mediately engaged him, to the entire satisfied-
 tion of Lady Towereliffe, who never asked or
cared any more about her protege, gratified
that she had achieved ``a job,'' and that by
her interest, and her only, a place in the
world had been filled up, which would have been
occupied by some one else, perhaps equally
deserving, if she had not interfered, and she
was satisfied for the present, to have been of
eonseqtuience to somebody, no matter whom.

His hollow, blood-shot eyes, betrayed a wild,
watchful, suspicious expression, by no means
prepossessing; and there was something in-
suitable in the bland, perpetual smile he
always wore upon his countenance, and in the
frozen tranquillity of his manner, which ocean-
sionally, though seldom, gave way to bursts
of tempestuous emotion. The very pupils of
his eyes seemed to become darker, with a
fcarfully wild and ferocious expression when
irritated, while the fierce fire flashed out from
beneath his lowering brows, with a blaze of
inexpressible fury; yet in a moment he could
command himself again into a cold, calm, and
almost haughty exterior, while the spectral
palenoss of his handsome eountenance, made
him look like marble itself
Years passed on, during which Sir Arthur
endured, rather than enjoyed, Mr Howard's
attendance, whoso pre-occupied air and vague
manner, continually annoyed him; but his be-

When Henry returned for the first time
from school, six or  seven months after Mr
Howard had become domesticated at Porto-

fancy for the boy, would fetch and carry for

made to control his agitation. His hands

Tn most popular girl at Mrs Penfold's `` Se-

was MArion Dunbar, too much loved by her
companions to be envied; admired by all,
and almost idolized by each, while beneath
the gay, sparkling surface of her joyous dis-
position, there rolled on a warm current of

sensibility and feeling sufficient to repay, and
more than repay, all the deep tenderness and
enthusiastic affection sho excited among the
little circle of her young and ardent friends.
Cast in the finest mould of classical beauty,
and formed mentally as well as personally in
the very poetry of nature, the perfect grace
and symmetry of her features became en-
livened frequently by an area and radiant
smile, like a Hebe, glowing with the richest
hues of health and joy. Her splendid eyes
sparkled with every passing emotion, some-
times dimmed for a moment by tears of sensi-
ability, but usually glittering with smiles, while
occasionally, when amused or delighted, she
burst into a comic selfish laugh, the very es-
sense of glee and joyousness-a most en-
livening accompaniment to what she said,
while her conversation, always fresh and un-
premeditated, rushed straight from her heart,
fresh and natural as a mountain stream.

might have been mistaken for black. No de-
eruption could do justice to the fascination of
her smile, without one shade of affectation.
while her pure transparent complexion, fresh
as a bouquet of roses, took a richer tint from
all the fitting emotions which chased each
other through her mind. A rich profusion of
nut-brown hair played around her high are-
ed forehead of alabaster whiteness, and a
thousand laughing dimples quivered around
her dolicutoly-formed mouth, giving her a
merry, joyous look of girlish beauty, varied
occasionally by a melting softness of express-
sion when she looked in any countenance that
she loved. On one occasion, a celebrated
sculptor asked Sir Patrick's permission to
take a cost of Marion's head, and on obtain-

of Marion, in the estimation of her friends,
was, that her face seemed like a mirror
formed to reflect overy emotion of their own
hearts.
The most stern and moroso of human be-
ings must have been conciliated into some de-
gree of regard, by the deep tenderness of a
character '` without one jarring atom for'd,''
which seemed made only to love and to be
loved. While her gay fancy revelled in
'' cheerful yesterdays and confident to-mor-
rows,'' the flowers that grew around her path,
the birds that sang as she passed, the very
turf beneath her feet, and the sky above her
head, called forth her feelings. She had a
year to spare for the sorrows of every one who
claimed her sympathy, and a ready smile for
the joys of all her companions, while yet a
great deal of unoccupied love remained at
her disposal, the chief portion of which was
bestowed with prodigal enthusiasm on her in-
dupont uncle Sir Arthur, whose doting af-
election would have spoiled any other dispose-
tion, but only rendered her more keenly de-

and entering into all her juvenile feelings
with a versatility of mind astonishing at his
advanced age. Nothing on earth is more
touching than to see the warmth of sensing-
city and enthusiasm yet surviving the hill of
many a year in this disappointing nand sor-
awful world; but there was a degree of mu-
dual confidence between Sir Arthur and his
young niece, which onn seldom exist with a
disparity of years and oircumstanaees. Be-
sides all her feminine gentleness, and almost
optical peacefulness of character, Marion yet
displayed at times a power of intellect, and
an energetic strength of character, for which
n superficial observer would have been totally
unprepared; for her mind seemed always to
rise in proportion to the occasion, while she
had been born apparently to practise without

reserve, that beautiful Christian rule, for
each individual always to consider himself
last. Rarely are deep feelings, and in-
tense sensibility united with that high in-
intelligence of mind, and that vivid gladness of
spirit peculiar to Marion; but the stream of
her mind was deep as well as sparkling, while
during her early years sorrow little through
hor cheerful, laughter-long mind, like the
shadow of a butterfly in a bright sunny
flown-bed. Pleased `` she knew not why,
and oar'd not wherefore,'' there was a peer-
liar grace in all she did, and an infectious
merriment in all she said, which attracted a
joyous group of gay companions continually
around her, on whom the light of her own
buoyant vivaoity seemed to be continually
and brightly reflected.
Nothing could be more pleasing and char-
altruistic than to observe the refined in-
genuity with which, from the earliest age,
Marion tried to evade receiving the multi-
tudor of little presents with which it was Sir
Arthur's delight to surprise her. Trinkets

and toys would have multiplied around her, if
she had not frequently made an ostentation
of possessing more than it was possible for
her to use, and when Sir Arthur allowed her
a choice, in any gift he was about to force
on her acceptance, she invariably selected
that which seemed least expensive; and her
uncle afterwards told, that when, on the
twelfth anniversary of her birth-day, he clasp-
ed a beautiful MIaltose chain rond her neck,
she said to him with a deepening colour and
faltering voice,  I would like better to
love you for nothing, uncle Arthur. My

already. You know I inherited half dear
mamma's ornaments, and PAstries say you
bring Rundell and Bridge in your pocket

quite as happy to see you all for yourself.'
The merry-eyed Marion seemed to `` wear
her heart upon her sleeve,'' and to seco only
what was best in all those with whom she
associated. With her small mans, it was
truly astonishing how frequently and ingeni-

conferring a favour on her companions, as if

knew the different. There was not an in-
divides among her numerous young conte-
parties, who did not often relate traits of
goodness in one whom they always found
ready to answer the largest drafts that could
be draw upon her good offices, while the
cheerfulness of her mind reflected itself on all.
If one of her young friends rushed joyously
forward to announce some unexpected sueces,
Marion's features seemed as if they had been
put together only for smiles and laughter,
while her bright oyo littered with instant
gladness, and a low of colour mounted to
her dumpling cheek, as she felt and expressed
with spontaneous warmth all that kindness
could dictate,- and more;- but if
some unforeseen affliotion visited the heart
of her juvenile associates, thero seemed no
limits to the patience with which she listened
to their complaints, or to the anger assiduity

with which she endeavoured to alleviate their
sorrow. The most trifling attentions she
never overlooked, were it merely the tying of
a string, or the picking up of a handkerchief,
which she did with a good-humoured grace
all her own, and the trifling actions of life are
those by which the character can generally be
most justly appreciated. Great achievements
are a conspicuous embroidery laid on the sur-
face often for office, but the ground-work and
material are formed of what is most untrue-
sive and often severely noticed. With Marion,
every kind and generous feeling was natural
as perfume to the violet, and equally instead-
able from her daily existence; her ideas
were fresh and vivid, while her manner was
thoroughly fascinating and thoroughly semi-
nine, at the same time that all the grace of
look and expression added a surpassing charm
to her lively and intelligent conversation, every
word of which sprang from the spontaneous
impulse of a heart full of natural emotion and
straightforward sentiments.

itself by diligence and by alacrity to oblige.
Evon Mrs Penfold was disarmed of half
her severity, by the eagerness with which
Marion, buoyant with youth, and joyous as a
bird on wing, undertook any task, or suffered
any penance to compensate for such little
etourderies as had caused her to be in tempo-
rary disgrace; and the stern schoolmistress
herself could not but smile sometimes in the
midst of her gravest lecture, to obsero the
look of extreme anxiety and self-reproach with
vehicle Marion listened to the catalogue of her
small indiscretions, and the grateful joy with
which she heard that there were any terms
on which she might yet be restored to favour.

anion, frequently amused herself by invent-
ing imaginary scrapes into which Marion was
supposed to have fallen, and by sending her
express to Mre Ponfold for a reprimand.,
while the lively girl watched, in laughing am-

nance, the instant she unexpectedly found her-
self honourably acquitted.
Thug the foundation of Marion's mind was
laid, and these were the light breezes that
tufted the smooth current of her life; but en-
chanted by the slightest pleasures, few ever
bore the burden of her annoyanees so lightly,
while a brilliant painted curtain hung over
the future, filled with images of anticipated
joy, to be realised in all their brightness and
beauty, as soon as she became emancipated
from the dreary thraldom of Mrs Penfold's
manufaetory of young ladies.
Meantime, Marion's mind grow and flour-
shed, like some rare and beautiful plant in-
judicious cultivated, yet glowing in almost
unprecedented luxurianee. Plunged in this
inextrieable labyrinth of educational trouble,
she had to undergo lessons from sun-rise till
sun-set, while all the varied arts, sciences,
and languages were piled promiscuous on
her brain, like an ill-grown coppice, distorted
and stunted for want of more judicious thin-
ning and training. She could name things in

nature and properties; while, as Sir Arthur
complained, `` poor little Marion was taught
plenty of sound, but no sound sense, except
what she had inherited by nature, without
paying P100 a-year for it.'
In music Marion displayed great taste and
expression, while her flexible, richly-toned
voice poured out sometimes a flood of har-
money most exquisite to hear, as the pathos of
her full round intonation drew forth the
feeling and sympathy of all her auditors.
Expression in music is like expression of
countenance, not to be taught or required,
but the spontaneous result of natural cmo-
tion, and with Marion music was almost a
passion, for her whole spirit seemed instinct
with melody, while her lark-like voice trilled
its liquid notes with joyful hilarity.

minutes, while they were hastily slurred over

Before Marion had been  long at school,
however, she formed an intimacy which pro-
ducey a permanent and most happy effect on
all her subsequent life and feelings. Clara
Granville, several years older than herself, had
been nurtured, like her brother, in holiness,
and in every domestic excellence, while she
lived only for the dictates of a chastened and
sanctified heart. . Delicate in health, and fra-
file in extreme to appearance, there was some-
thing almost seraphie in the delicate purity of
her lovely countenanee, and in the tranquil
composure of her graceful manner. During a
long and tedious illness, with which Clara was
seized, a short time before leaving school, she
testified a tender and almost exclusive affee-

when holidays, romping, sight-seeing, birth-

these were the days of his own boyhood, before
children were too wise and busy to have time
for natural enjoyment. The Admiral was
thought, by Mrs Penfold, a asad airport, ha-
ing already, as she knew, done all in his
power to dissuade Sir Patrick from placing
the `` little fairy,'' as he called his favourite,
in such a tread-mill as her school-room, where
he said the only knowledge to be required
was, that knowledge of the world which
ruins the heart, and where fascination was
to be taught as one of the fine arts, but all
his representations, whether in jest or in
earnest, were vain. Sir Patrick, being the
guardian of both his sisters, had determined
to expend a considerable part of the provision
bequeathed by their father in training them
up as carefully, for the course of fashionable
life, as he would have tried a promising
race-horse which was expected to win the

with an extraordinary degree of apparently

found nothing to feed upon in the old, formal,
rigid manner, and stern upright appearance of
the schoolmistress, who repelled all intercourse
with her pupils, considering them necessary
grievances to be endured in her house, as
a source of existence to herself, but not of
pleasure. Towards these little slaves of edu-
cation, driven from task to task with ceaseless
pertinacity, no confidence was shown, and
between them conversation became systematic-.
cally discouraged. A governess was appointed
to sleep in each room to secure silence among
the pupils, few of whom had that glow of heart
and imagination peculiar to Marion, and it
was fortunate, perhaps, that her large stock
of sympathy was not more frequently in re-

were sometimes imparted to her wondering

superlative. Pure as the swan that passed
through the darkest and most turbid stream
with plumage unsoiled, Marion's mind in the
mean time remained untainted by the atmos-

taught at all that seemed good, avoided what
was oil, and rejected every thought that
might injure the unsophistieated excellence of
her artless mind.

There arose, however, in time, one source
of individual anxiety to Marion, known only
to herself and Mrs Penfold, but it increased
in weight and region every year, throwing
occasionally a shadow of are over that bright
yOung countenance, in general so beaming
with joy, though with true philosophy Marion
tried often to forget what it had proved it-
possible for her to remedy. Once a-quarter,
or at least during every successive `` half,''
the mortifying fact forced itself upon her ob-
servation, that no bills were so irregularly
paid as her own, for while their amount
rapidly accumulated, Sir Patrick's agent
forwarded annually the very smallest in-
statement, with a thousand apologies, and
many promises of a final satisfactory settle-
ment at some future period, which period
never seemed any nearer; and Mrs Penfold
often dryly remarked, in the hearing of
Marion, that `` short accounts make long
friends.'

luence was less than nothing, and she greatly
feared lest his vehement partiality to herself
might lead him to overlook the very limited
nature of his own income, and to volunteer
some generous sacrifice, such as she would
rather suffer any privations than occasion.
The pension and half-pay of Sir Arthur very
barely sufficed, who knew, to defray his extent-
sive charities, and to furnish sometimes thc
hospitable table, and the battle of first-rate
claret, round which it was his delight to g-
the a frequent circle of old brother admi-
als; but his purse was little calculated to
stand the shook of such a draft as Sir Patrick
would unhesitatingly have drawn upon it, had
the idea occurred to him that Sir Arthur
might perhaps be induced to tako Marion's
school bills upon himself.
In no instance was it more obvious than in
that of Sir Patrick Dunbar, how precisely in
society men are generally estimated at their
own valuation. He was, like his sisters, pre-

contempt for others, rendered his slightest
notice an event of considerable magnitude

deemed his superiors in rank, fortune, and

ever, among his own exclusive set, whom he
admitted to the most unbounded familiarity
and good fellowship, inviting them to enter-

Sir Patrick's grooms and footmen always
roundly estimated his income at L.20,000 a-

of all the parents united, who paid Mrs Pen-
fold regularly for cramming their children's
understandings; but while Sir Patrick made
it a matter of accurate calculation, to train
Marion with skill and sagaeity in the way
most likely to take her specdily off his hands,
yet it was no part of his calculation to pay
for any thing in money, if he could do so in

Mrs Penfold's grave and dry expression of

Day after day elapsed, week after week,
and every time Sir Patrick entered the room,
or drow out his pocket handkerchief, Marion
thought she was on the eve of being paid;
but at length her holidays came to a close,
and still not a syllable transpired respecting
her funds. Rendered desperate at last by
anxiety to re-enter school, Laden with pre-
sent to her favourite companions, Marion,
who valued money only as a means of being
kind to others, ventured one day, with glow-
ing cheeks, and faltering voice, to remind
Sir Patrick, for the first time, of their little

That `` other time'' never came, however,
and Marion returned poenniless to school, sym-
patching more fully than she had cor done
before, in Mrs Penfold's lamentations respect-
ing Sir Patrick's carelessness about money,--
a subject which supplied that lady with a
ready-made excuse, whenever she was out of
humour at any rate, for venting it all on her

her thoughts, and trying to hope the best,
quickly resumed the course of her occupy-

that in two years she would have nothing
more to learn-the whole range of human ae-

Clara Granville, and Caroline Smythe, ha-
ing attained the highest ame of perfection
under the finishing hand of Mrs Penfold, wore
about to be emancipated in a few months from
the thraldom of school, and to astonish so-
city by their brilliant requirements; respect-

them, though the inclination seemed wanting
in both girls, being already surfeitedl with ad-
migration and panegyric among their masters
and governesses, who vied with each other in
praising their two most advanced pupils, by
whoso influence they hoped hereafter to ob-
tain recommendations and employment.
17s mODERN FLIRTATION.
Marion had strolled one evening with Caro-
line, farther than Miss Smythe had over been
known to venture before; and the two young
friends were seated in an arbour at the ex-
rome verge of the bounds prescribed by Mrs
Ponfold, in earnest conversation, while water-
in with delight the declining sun, which su-
early illuminated a heavy mass of clouds in
the western horizon. Time flew on, and dark-
ness nearly closed around them, while they
discussed with lively, careless humour, all the
petty annoyances of their daily life, and com-
parody the little hopes and fears they enter-
gained for the future. As the hour became
later, Marion felt that the high exhilarating
key in which Caroline spoke, and her gay, well-
rung-out laugh, made her almost nervous in
the obscure and solitary retreat to which they
had withdrawn; but ashamed of her own ti-
dirty, sho determined to conquer or general

certainly, neither on this occasion, nor on any
other, was it with confidence, as no living be-
ing seemed entirely in the confidence of MisE
Smythe, who, while she appeared gayle and
heedlessly to rattle on in conversation, yet
kept a cautious silence respecting all that
concerned herself.
Many very reserved persons pass for being
perfectly open, by means of a frank, free man-
ner, and by speaking in a confidential tone
concerning the most private affairs of those
with whom they inverse; and this Caroline
did to excess, asking Marion, with every ap-
parlance of kindness, a hundred questions,
which in her own case sho either could not.
or would not have answered, and testifying
the most cordial, unfeigned interest in all
that related to the prospects or feelings of
her companion, who never attempted to con-
deal a wish or a thought, and often forgot
that the trust was not mutual.
Caroline was talking eagerly with great
animation, and telling Marion that the only
injury she never would forgive, was, if any of
180 MIO0DERN FLIRIATIONS
those she loved had a sorrow they did not as-
low her to share with them; and especially if
they permitted themselves to suffer from any
peeuniary difficulties which it was within her
power to relieve, when suddenly Marion Said
a hand on her arm, making a hurried signal
for silence, while sho whispered in a low under-
tone.
I have scarcely heard you for the last five
minutes. Did you observe that strange-look-

alarm, and speaking in a low hoarse tone of
extreme terror. ``' For your life, Marion, do

In agonized suspense and apprehension the
two friends remained during several minutes,
cowering behind the overhanging branches,
and secondly venturing to breathe, while Caro-
line bent her head eagerly forward to match
the slightest sound, and grasped Marion's
arm almost conclusively, as if to secure her
being perfectly immoveable; at length, after
sometime, she heaved a deep sigh expressions
of relief, and looked up, saying,

inaudible murmur, and his hand plunged into
the breast of his coat, seemed as if it grasped
some weapon there, while Marion, taking ad-
vantage of his pre-occupied attention, darted
off with the speed of thought, and almost as
noiselesaly fled towards the house. A loud
angry cry to stop her, mingled with nurses
and impreeations, from the madman, while he
wed his singularly long arms menacingly
above his head, only accelerated her page,
while he followed some steps in pursuit; but
terror gave wings to her feet, and rushing
into the entrance-hall, she instantly rang
the largo dinner bell, and raised an alarm,
which assembled the whole household, all
of whom gazed with looks of panic-struck
astonishment at Marion palo and ghastly
countenanee.
Not a moment required to be lost in place-
nation, for MIrs Ponfold seemed at once to
guess the whole nature and extent of Caro-
line's danger, the instant her name was men-
toned ; therefore Marion had but to point out
the direction in which she might be found,

when Mrs Penfold hastened forward, revealed
by several of the more active servants.
WHen Marion had rapidly executed some
orders committed to her, she quickly returned
towards the arbour, but not a trace remained
there of any one. The little table had been
upset, several branches torn down that sur-
rondod tho entrance, and the grass beneath
was mch trampled and disfigured; but all was
silent and deported. After one hurried glance
of alar and perplexity, Marion hastened for-
ward to the garden gate, which she found had
been violently burst open, and on emerging
into the high road beyond, she there found
Mrs Penfold and her servants all crowding
round Caroline, who remained in a dead faint
on the ground for nearly half an hour.
A marriage was rapidly disappearing at full
speed in the distance, but already almost too far
off to be distinguished; and Marion perceived
the figure of a man lurking behind the hedge
else beside her; but when she made it evident
that he was observed, he rushed up close to
her side, saying, in a threatening tone, between

his clenched teeth, `` You have provoked a
madman ?'
Scarcely had Marion timo to utter an ex-
animation of sudden fright, before he sprung
over the hedge, and was seen running across
the neighbouring fields, until his figure min-
fled with the surrounding gloom, and vanish-
nd out of sight.
Mrs Penfold's chief care, after Caroline'ae
recovery from her alarming swoon, was ear-
nestle to enjoin that the circumstances of this
adventure should never be mentioned, or so
much as remembered by those who had wit-
nested them; a story so extraordinary and
alarming, being likely to injure her establish-
ment, besides causing much unnecessary gos-
sip among the younger pupils; but had Marion
even been disposed to consign, as desired, the
whole adventure to oblivion, she could not but
be continually reminded of it for several
weeks afterwards, by the startled and agitated
manner of Caroline, whose frolicsome spirit
had entirely deserted her, while she seemed
for some time to be in imminent danger of
188 MINDEN FLIRTATIONS.
a nervous fever. If any one appeared suddenly
in the room, she almost screamed with the
start it occasioned her; she could not bear
for a moment to remain alone, and seemed as
if continually listening, even when sale in the
house, for the sound of steps in pursuit of
her. Gradually, however, for mind became
more composed, and she ventured one day to
take a stroll with Marion in some of the
nearer parts of the garden, though evon there
she scarcely spoke above hor breath, and
turned hastily round several times, as if a-
prehensile that some one approached.
Had the far-famed Ups tree grown over
the arbour, Caroline would sparsely have
shunned more fearfully the slightest approach
in that direction, and with equal are did she
avoid any allusion to what had occurred
there, not a hint of which eer transpired in
her most confidential moments. The very
sound of her own feet on the gravel seemed
to startle her, and as she walked beneath the
shade of some tall forest trees which over-
hung the garden-wall, Marion observed that
MoODER FLIRTATION. 189
Caroline trod more cautiously; and though
she dropped not a word respecting her feel-
ings or fears, it was evident that her nerves
were strung to an agony of sensitivenoess, for
the fluttering of a bird in a hedge, or the fall
of a leaf, made her start, and she seemed
about at last to give up the point in despair,
and hurry homewards, when suddenly a loud
shrill whistle arose amidst the branches of an
ash-tree, almost directly over their heads, and
before Marion had time to look round, a
small packet had dropped at the feet of
Caroline.
With a half-suppressed cry of alarm, the
terrified girl fled, while Marion, severely lese
frightened, instinctively picked up the parcel,
and followed, while again she was pursued by
a volley of months and imperfections, which
ended in a laugh so wild, so maniacal, and so
fearful, that for months afterwards it rung in
her ears, causing her a shudder of horror and
alarm.
WHen Mrs Penfold tore open an inner-
able multitude of seals which closed the

packet addressed to Caroline, she discovered
within only a long incoherent letter of several
sheets, filled with the most extravagant pro-
sessions of ardent love, and the most ocho-
ment declarations, that nothing on earth
could impede or discourage him in his resold-
tion to carry or off, which he seemed still
persuade, with the self-delusion peculiar to
mattress, must be a welcome assurance to
Caroline, whose words and actions he perse-
covering attributed to the arbitrary influence
of others. Accompanying this barrage of
most intolerable nonsense, was a black shade
in a wooden frame, representing the profile
of a young man, certainly handsome, and
which seemed to Marion like features she
had known elsewhere, but being frequently
addicted to observing resemblances, she felt
at once persuaded that this must be some
such vague and unaecountable likeness as she
had frequently found or janeiro before.
Time work on, and still Caroline Lingered
at school, unwilling apparently to forsake
the comparative quietness of Mrs Ponfold's

length, on the evening previous to that fixed

MIrs Smythe was expected to convey her
home, Mrs Penfold was bestowing on Caro-
line some of her last advice, on the most ap-
proved modes of `` getting on'' in society, and
especially on the manners and conversation
most attractive to gentlemen, when a note
was brought into the room, which had a-

telligeneo that Mrs Smythe's marriage had
been upset a few miles off, causing so severe a
blow on the head, that a concession of the
brain had taken place, and she continued in-

little hope remained of hor recovery. The
Doctor who wrote these hurried particulars
had obligingly sent his own marriage and ser-
want to convey Miss Smythe to the spot, that
she might take a last leave of her dying real-
time, and he recommended that she should
not lose an instant, or it might be too late to
find the sufferer in life.
Struel with grief and consternation by this
most unexpected and calamitous intelligence.
Caroline, though she had never before seemed
much to love her aunt, yet now become over-
wvholmed with the shock, and lost not an in-
stant in hastily preparing to obey the mean-
holy summons, by throwing on her clock and
bonnet, while she rushed into the army of
Marion, and burst into an agony of tours in
bidding her farewell.
The French governess who had been sum-
one to escort Carolina in the carriage, was
one of those nervous persons, who became
perfectly frantic when hurried, and she flew
about the room, uttering a volley of inceo-
herent exolamations, expressive of her wonder

utility, while her preparations seemed to make
no visible progress. There is a secret, my-
serious pleasure in being waited for, which
every living mortal seems to enjoy when they
have the opportunity; and without a thought
of Caroline's impatience, hor anxiety, and her
sorrow, Madame D'Albert expressed the
most eager and vehement solitude about her
of dress, and a resolution not to stir till
equipped to her entire satisfaction, for so
rare and almost unprecedented an event, as
leaving the boundaries of Armoured HOuse.
Every thing that has a limit, however,
must come to an end, and Madame D'Au-
bert's toilette being at last completed, she
leisurely advanced, talking to herself and to
everybody else, arranging her shawl, and

tried to console and encourage her, till at
length they exchanged a final embrace, and
darted. Scarcely, however, hal Miss Smythe
placed her foot upon the stos, while the
man-servant who accompanied the carriage
carefully assisted her in, before Marion sud-
denly sprung forward with an exclamation of
terror, seized hold of Caroline's dress, and be-
more she could speak, dragged her forcibly
into the house, axclaiming in accounts almost

Before Marion would finish her sentence,
the supposed servant had violently seized
Miss Smythe by the arms, and was about
forcibly to drag her towards the marriage,
when the loud cries of Marion brought as-

a trade could be seen of the madman, who
instantly vanished; and the post-boy could
give no intelligence respecting him, except
that he had been ordered out at an inn close
by, in urgent haste, that evening, with a
promise of double payment if he implicitly
obeyed the gentleman, who seemed highly
irritable, and swore at him in a most fearful
manner, if he made the slightest delay, or so
much as asked a direction which way to turn.
The most diligent search was made, but
made in vain, by the officers of police, to find
out the lunatic's retreat, which eluded their
utmost research; and as Caroline Smythe
was privately removed soon afterwards from
school, where the subject was forbidden ever
to be mentioned, the whole story seemed al-
most buried in oblivion, and Marion herself
felt at last as if the entire adventure had
been an agitating dream, remembered by no
one but herself.

MARiON's sister, Agnes, five years older than
herself, after being distinguished as the best
musician, best sketches, best linguist, best
everything, at Mrs Penfold's, had left school
with no real knowledge, concept of the most
frivolous kind, accidentally gathered in con-
operation, and repeated again in society like
a parrot. Formed to excite the most rap-
turous admiration, by the gorgeous magnifi-
cone of her almost regal beauty, art had at-
ed the part of the Fairy Bountiful in form-
ing Agnes, while nature had showered her
holiest gifts on Marion.
MoDER LIRTATIONS. 197
Agnes was brilliant without being interest-
in, and dazzling without being attractive, for
her mind seemed irremediably and ineorrigi-
bly vulgar, selfish, and vain. A good actress,
an inimitable mimic, and incomparable in a
tableau, she assumed generally a queen-like
dignity of manner, ``stalking through lite,''
as Sir Arthur said, `` with an assured and
stately step, as if practising for her appear-
once as a Duchess at the next coronation.''
Admiration seemed to Agnes the only plea-
sure of life, and amusement its only business;
while, if ever shoe had possessed any sensible-
city, it was frittered away on the fictitious
sorrows of the Adeline and Julian in the
volumes which she read with surpassing dili-
genre from a circulating library; though in
all -other respects, Agnes wasted her time
amidst such listless idleness, that she might
have lct hcr nails grow, like those of a Chi-
neo mandarin, to testify how literally she

of others; but those who trace nothing cx-
kept evil in their companions, have seldom
much good in themselves. Marion found it
one of the most important and pleasing stu-
dies in the world, to comprehend the chirac-
ter and temper of her friends and connexions,
besides her own, with a wish to render her-
self suitable to them, as her mind, pliable
without weakness, was bent on constantly
yielding her own wishes to those she loved;
it this unobtrusive generosity was only a
subject of satirical remark to her sister, who
could neither understand not believe in M-
rio's utter singletons of heart, and disinter-
osteinoss; her own sole aim being selfish in-
dulgonee, and her sole rule to obtain it in the
easiest possible way.
Selfless was the ruling passion of Agnes;
lovo of others to quickening principle, or
rather impulse with Marion, who would have
zealously planted flowers for even strangers
to enjoy ; but Agnes would have plunged all
those of her friends, and scarcely taken the
trouble to rear any even for her own use.
MoDERN FLIRTATIONS. 199
Agnes, old, vain, heartless, and self-suffice-
ent, thought she was made only for this
world, and this world for her, and for such
as herself, young, gay, rich, and lovely, while
all others were mere intruders on the area-
tion. But Marion, on the contrary, followed
the dictates of her own heart, in wishing to
do good of every kind to every person, while
still she had learned to aim above nature, to
that high standard of Christian perfection, s
exalted, that those who have gained the most
elevated human attainment in virtue and ex-
celleneo, must still consider the structure of
their minds, however beautifully decorated
with generous sympathies and kind emotions,

deed; but though the public eye usually
grows weary of the same features, however
present, during a second campaign, Agnes had
apparently taken out a diploma of beauty.,
the reputation for which seemed confirmed to
others by her own thorough conviction of be-
in completely unrivallod, and by the oxult-
ing consciousness she displayed of her own
supreme lovcliness. Three seasons of tumul-
tuous joy, triumph, and conquest, had already
succeeded each other, during which Agnes
was, to use her own expression, `` fiercely
gay,'' yet still no younger rival had appeared
to eclipse the dazzling array of her charms;
and not a whisper was heard that the fresh-
ness of her Raphael-like beauty was at all in-
paired; nor were any ladies over heard to
`` wonder'' what gentlemen could possibly see
to admire in Ages Dunbar, as not a dissent-
ing voice had yet ventured to make itself au-
bible on that subject.
Agnes began life with that perfect confi-
done in her own knowledge of the world,

specially when they have seen very little of
it, and with a thousand schemes and project
of perfect happiness. Though one after an-
other her castles of cards fell to the ground,
still, in the exercise of persevering enemy,
she rebuilt the edifice again with new mate-
rials, and on what she imagined a bottom con-
situation, but still in every instance, to her
own unutterablo astonishment, she found that

Considering overy officer she danced with
as a hero, and every gentleman who paid her
a compliment as a lover, Agnes wasted her
first season, as most young ladies do, in flirt-
ing with scarlet uniforms, the inhabitants of
which were generally so much like in ideas
and conversation, that if blindfolded, she
might have found it difficult or impossible to
distinguish which of her countless red and
gold admirers happened at the moment to be
``doing the agreeable.''
All her military victims were dying to know
what Ages thought of their brother officers:

sho liked their military and; if she proposed
patronising their night at the theatre; the-

she thought to colonel's daughter looked on
horseback; whether she did not think it bar-
famously tyrannical of the commander-in-chief
to insist on their all wearing uniforms; how
she liked the new regulation jacket; and
above all, whether she thought the order
for their wearing pistachios an improvement
or not
To all these subjects, and many more of
similar import, Agnes long for very profound
attention, not only during the discussion, but
in many a solitary hour, while her whole
head, heart, and understanding were crowded
with the recollection of oepaulettes, musta-
chios, spurs, and gold late, and she privately
believed that the supreme felicity of earth,-

Sir Patrick laughingly allogod that Agnes

suited to every different occasion,-a musical
conversation for amateurs, full of crotehets
and quaKers,-a hunting conversation about
foxes, dogs, and steeple-chases,-a Court of
Session conversation for the layers,-and a
dragoon conversation, discussing at great
length whether officers should dance with
spurs or without them, and in which she had
been known to enumerate correctly, the fae-
ings of every regiment in Her Majesty's ser-
vice.
Her brother often and loudly declared that
nothing is more perfectly hopeless, than for
any young lady to expect a serious attach-
ment from an officer actually quartered with
his regiment, as it was against all rule, and
contrary to all nature or custom, for Cupid to
attack the army. The mess-table, he assured
her, invariably sete its face against matrix-
money, and the mess-table conversation was an
ordeal, through which he protested that few
young ladies could wish their names to pass;
20t MODERN FLIRTATIONS.
but nevertheless, Agnes, full of groundless ex-
operations and lively vanity, continued to en-
dure a succession of heart-rending and unc-
countable disappointments, from very promise-
in military admirers, who had stolen her
bouquets, listened to her music, and drunk Sir
Patrick's claret month after month; but no
sooner did marching orders como for Dublin,
Leeds, or Canada, than these interesting
affairs came to an untimely end with a P.l.C.
card, or a sort of never-expect-to-meet-again
bow, and Agnes was left with the army list
in her hand, wondering what regiment would
come next, and whether there were many un-
married officers in it.

 Who, and what urbe Mrs and Miss

to herself, never apparently to obtain a satin-

her aunt had taken a villa at Portobello.
where the two English strangers excited ex-
treme attention, more from their evident de-
sire to avoid it, than from any thing very
remarkable in their appearance or manner,
though Mrs Smythe was certainly of that
genus old maid so common in England, with a
handsome independence, a suite of servants, a
pony-carriage, most splendid dress, and somc
pretensions still to youth and beauty, as any
fragment of good looks that yet remained the
most liberally displayed; while her manner
had a flirting tone of country most united-
able to her apparent age, forming a singular
contrast to the quaker-like simplicity of Ca-
romine's dress.
MODERN FLIRTATION. 211I
There was a singular contrast between the
gravity of costume affected by Miss Smythe,
and the keen festivity of spirit with which she
entered into every scheme of amusement, or
even, it might be said, of mischief. Her viva-
city was occasionally almost overpowering,
her fancy lively beyond example, while with
her brilliant, yet interesting animation, there
was mingled a rare cuteness of mind, a swift
comprehension, and an innate passion for all
that was amiable or beautiful, which gave live-
lines and vigour to what she said, though the
rapidity of her mind sometimes led Caroline to
a false estimate of persons and circumstances,
as she always judged or voted from instantane-
outs impulse; yet there was a generous frank-
ness in her disposition, which captivated those
who knew her, and a graceful simplicity in all
who did, which gave it interest; for, without
intention, there was something in all her
thoughts or actions, striking and peculiar.
Her features, though irregular, attracted
and enchaine the eye, from the magical
variety of their expression, and though an

amateur of mere beauty might have been sur-
praised and perplexed to divine why her light
grey eyes, pale checks, and chesnut hair
would beguile his attention away from the
moro perfect contour of others, the amateur
of physiognomy was delighted to find there
an ever-varying source of interest in watch-
in the bright emanations of thought, feel-
in, and vivacity, which littered or spark-
lod in her eye, or played about her mouth.
WHen Mrs Smythe first spotted at Porto-
bello, scarcely a week of gossiping, wonder,
and conjecture hal elapsed, in the little
community around, when she requested to
have an interview with Sir Arthur along,
which took place immediately, and must have
excited much interest in his mind, as the
Admiral remained silent and abstracted dur-
in the whole subsequent evening, while he
strolled slowly up and down the drawing-
room, `` pacing the quarter-deek,'' as he called
it, for a length of time; and, after being
closeted some hours the following day with

proceeded to a magistrate's house together,
with whom they requested a private confer-
knee, the purport of which did not transpire.
From that day, an intimacy, amounting
to friendship, was established between Sir
Arthur and the two ladies, who seemed on all
occasions to look to him for advice and pro-
edition, and in whose house they spent a part
of every day, to the unspeakable delight of
Henry De Lnnsey, who was harmed, on his
return from college, to find so agreeable an

how rapid seems the transition from boyhood

an extraordinary development of mind and

thought the Admiral, when viewing the char-
after of his young protege, as it gradually
arose to personal and intellectual supremacy
His mind was ardent, courageous, and deeply
contemplative, full of generous impulses, but
aunt to view all that happened to himself
through and exaggerated medium. His my-
serious history, and the fascination of his
manner and appearance cast a spell over the
interest and affections of all who beheld his
countenance, or heard the sound of his har-
obvious video. With a strikingly handsome
person, he had already acquired a decided air
of fashion and refinement, while a bright vein
of almost chivalrous romance which unlicensed

ment, inclining him to dwell much on mean-
holy sings, relating to the strange circus-
stances of his own early history. KEenly sen-
site to kindness or neglect, his love and gra-
title to Sir Arthur were without bounds,
and his brotherly affection for Marion was
tinged with the natural enthusiasm of his his-
position, but before long the warmest and

deepest feelings of his nature were secretly
concentrated on the ga, giddy, and fascist-
ing Caroline Smythe. Every scrap of paper
that came in his way became covered with
sketches of her buoyant figure and graceful
profile, in a variety of animated attitudes; or,
on other occasions, verses in Latin or English,
little better certainly than the nonsense verses
at school, immortalise her charms.
Young as he was, however, Henry's spirit
recoiled already from the danger of loving too
well, or being beloved by any, when he was
taught, in hours of solitary election, to re-
member that principle and honour must for-
bid him to seek a mutual attachment, while
his name and station remained unknown, and,
perhaps, disgraceful. There was a bewilder-
in power in Caroline's society, which chained
him to her side wherever they met, while, con-
tracy to his resolutions and wishes, his every
look, smile, word, and action became steeped
in loe. Often and severely did ho praised

to remember, in her presence, any thing but
the delight of listening to her gay allies and
her delicious laugh; though the birth of her
young eyes became veiled often by a look of
care as sudden, as it was to him account-
able, being so foreign to the sparkling, almost
mischievous gayety of her future.
Henry's devoted, and nearly boyish intake-
ment, raised in his heart many a high aspire-
tion after future distinction, many a bright
hope of honour, promotion, and usefulness.
The model for his imitation in every thing
noble and distinguished was Sir Arthur, and
he resolved to sacrifice lovo itself, till he had
attained, like him, a name and a station for
himself. The very sound of Sir Arthur's step,
the very tones of his voice, were dear to him:
and, casting side every softer emotion con-
neetod with his romantic reveries respecting
Caroline, he became impatient to face the
bitter blasts of the world's trials, taking his
beloved benefactor for his example, and the
Holy Scriptures as his guide.

tho august truths of religion, in all their
awfulness and solemn obligations.''
Knowledge is power, and knowledge of
character is the greatest power of all, but
Henry, in general very penetrating, was per
flexed by the flirting, light-headed manner of
Mrs Smythe, whenever she was in the society
of gentlemen her own contemporaries in age
and the grave doforential manner she adopted
towards her young companion, whom she
seemed to treat almost inadvertently as her
superior, though the slightest indication of hen
doing so usually brought the ready colour of
Caroline in vivid flashes to her cheek, and
caused an appearance of mutual embarrass-
ment between the aunt and niese, which sur-
praised and puzzled him. Their extraordinary
munificence to the poor and public charities
also astonished him, as that appeared so
widely disproportionate to their visible means
and usual expenditure, though it seemed only
to please without surprising Sir Arthur, who
was accustomed to give so liberally himself,
that Henry sometimes feared he encouraged

his newly-found friends in a degree of lavish
extravagance, inconsistent with the ordinary
means of single ladies;, yet all was given with
a grateful negligent indifference to the vulgar
subject of pounds, shillings, and pence, quite
unprecedented. Subscription to church ex-
tension, missionaries, schools, Bibles, blankets,
food, clothing, goals, money, and medicine,
were scattered around them with unsparing
profusion, though it appeared to Henry, that.
in the case of Mrs Smythe herself, whose
name always appeared ostensibly on the list
as the larger contributor, there was less ala-
erity in giving, than in Caroline who seemed
to be purse-bearer for both, and always de-
frayed the whole amount.
Among the many things which surprised
Henry in Mrs and Miss Smythe, nothing had
that effect more than the keen, intense, and
rather satirical interest with which both ladies
gathered up every particular relating to the
manners, flirtations, and adventures of Cap-
tain De Crespigny, though it was evident.

titular of his former history and character,
neither knew him by sight. Mrs Smythe
mentioned rather contemptuous some vague
recollections of him formerly as a part, awk-
ward school-boy, while, to Henry's increasing
perplexity, the young lady's colour visibly
rose to carnation whenever he was expected-
eddy named, and her eyes usually littered
with a suppressed smile, if any anecdote or
description in Sir Arthur's conversation re-
late to him, till at length the curiosity which
had so long been evidently fermenting in the
minds of More and Miss Smythe, exploded one
day in the form of an eager request, that Sir
Arthur would invite Captain De Crespigny to
meet them at dinner.
Motion and Henry were amused at the
laughing alacrity with which Sir Arthur at
one consented, and they observed, after the
note was despatched, that many a whispered
consultation took place, and many a merry
jest passed among the lively trio, to which
they were not made a party, while the to

orion would have given worlds to witness the
scene, but her furlugh from Mrs Penfold's
had expired on the very day of Sir Arthur's
party, and she was most unwillingly deposited
in a marriage with her baggage, at the mo-
mont when Captain De Crespigny alighted in

had conveyed him from Piershill.

upon himself as her natural property, and
handed her to dinner, though no formal pre-
sensation had taken place.
With Caroline he was, before long, flirting
to the top of his bent, while she assumed a
charming look of consciousness when he and-
dressed her, receiving the whole artillery of
his small talk and activities with a most inter-
testing expression of naivete, though one
Henry observed in her smile so odd a mixture
of birth and malice, while, at the same time

a look of covert humour lurked in her eye,
and quivered on her lip, that he could not
but wonder at the grave demure look which
sho affected.
Nothing was ever more enchanting to Cap-
tain Do Crospigny than the blushing averted
looks with which Caroline listened to all his
insinuated admiration, while now and then
she nodded and smiled with the prettiest air
of incredulity imaginable, if he professed it
more openly. Occasionally, however, Captain
De Crespigny was almost put out of county-
nanee by her very unexpected replies, or very
nal-apropos questions, , which gradually led
him on, he scarcely knew how, into flirting
perfectly d I'outrage,  while opportunities
seemed purposely afforded him with a degree
of tact perfectly incredible in one so young,
and apparently unsophistieated, to say even
more than he had ever said before. With a
gay, laughing animation, almost amounting to
silliness, the young lady archly doubted his
sincerity, admired his wit, and slyly reminder-
stood all his compliments, till he was obliged

to repeat his meaning, and explain his insinu-
actions, making his professions and speeches
all so exceedingly plain and undisguised, that,
to his own astonishment, he found himself
positively making love, on a very few hours
acquaintance, with a degree of explicitness
which had never occurred to him in the whole
course of his practice before.
In the evening Caroline was, after many en-
treaties, prevailed on to favour Captain Do
Crespigny with a song, and never had he been
so completely perplexed, as by those with
which the young lady, preserving a look of
most imperturbable gravity, proceeded to fa-
our him. She seemed to have a dozen differ-
ent voices, and half-a-dozen different styles of
performance, but had evidently been well
taught, and displayed occasionally some beau-
tiful notes. At first hcr tones were clear and
sharp, accompanied by the strangest flourishes
and cadences that Captain De Crespigny had
ever heard or imagined. In the next song,
her voice was low and husky, while her eye
were most sentimentally elevated to the cell-

in, with a sort of St Cecilia expression, rather
partaking, however, of the ludicrous, and in
her voice another like a mouse in a cupboard.
At one time her tone reminded him of a well-
known singer at Vauxhall; at another he felt
persuaded she was taking off Clara Novello;
occasionally there was so considerable a tinge
of the brogue, that he became eonvineel she
must be Irish, and she ended by singing,
The Dog's MInt Man,'' in a one out-
screaming  peacock, but adopting the air
and attitude of a Catalan, and concluded with
looking cxultingly round in expectation of rap-
turous applause, which Sir Arthur bestowed
in abundance, and Captain Do Crespigny in
comparative moderation, being for the first
time in his life at a loss to know whether he
were treated on this occasion in jest or in
earnest.
Repeated subsequent meetings at Staubach
Cottage continued the intimacy which Cnp-
tain Do Crespiguy had so oddly begun, and
his curiosity became more and more piqued,
by the singularity of Miss Smythe's manner

and conversation. Sho displayed, along with
a most extravagant love of amusement, a ge-
ius for satire and mimicry quite precise-
dented, and in which the most freely in-
dulled. Many a scene was acted over by
her, and supported by Henry with astonish-
ing talent and vivacity, for both seemed to
have a similar propensity, being able, after an
hour's intercourse with any individual, to imi-
tate his whole peculiarities with almost ragi-
cal precision,-to follow in an imaginary eon-
version the very train of his ideas, and to
represent every little trick or habitual express-
sion, every turn of the head, and every one
of the voice, with a gay look of cookery
which would have made their fortunes on the
stage.
One evening, Sir Arthur having delivered
up to his young friends the key of an old
chest, filled with velvet boats and proceeded
silks dresses, formerly worn by his bye-gone
ancestors, Caroline, Henry, and Captain De
Crespigny amused themselves by grouping
some beautiful tableaux, und by acting cha-

rates. At one time, both the gentlemen ap-
peaked in similar costumes, as Shakespeare's
two Dromios in the Comedy of Errors, when
Sir Arthur suddenly exclaimed, as if he had
made some great discovery,`` How very
strange that I never before observed the like-
ness between you two good-looking young fel-
lows1 I declare it is quite remarkable1 If
you were brothers in reality as well as in pre-
tense, it could scarcely be more striking
bDo pray Captain Do Crcspigny, turn your
profile more towards Mrs Smythe, that she
may see what I mean 1''
Henry laughingly received these remarks
as an undoubted compliment, and bowed with
good-humoured grade to Sir Arthur, who ob-
served with astonishment that Captain De
Crespigny's colour rushed to his very temples,
and receded again, leaving his countenance
palo and almost ghastly, while he suddenly
broke off the entertainment, and strode up to
the fire-place, where for one minutes he
stood, with his back to the company, in evi-
dent agitation, while a dead silence ensued.
MODEN FLIRTATIONS. 227
 Wall l'' whispered Sir Arthur to Caro-
line, `` I have often been told that people are
never pleased with a likeness, but certainly
Louis Do Crespigny is the most conceited of
men, to feel so intolerable angry at being
compared to my young friend here. There
are certainly worse-looking people in the
world than Henry I' added the Admiral,
with a look of partial affection.` And it
was no such insult as De Crespigny seems
to think, when I paid him the compliment,
to say that he resembled my boy, who
was in every respect the very pride of my
heart.''
I wish the Captain may never meet with
a greater mortification,'' replied Caroline,
laughing; ``and I am sure he would be much
the better of a few pretty severe ones to
keep him in his senses''
Henry meantime had observed with good-
humoured surprise, and no small degree of
perplexity, the excitement, so disproportionate
to the occasion, into which Captain De Crew-
piggy had been thrown by Sir Arthur's re-

went up to him, saying, in a lively and rally-

' I' can only say,'' interposed Sir Arthur,
` that the impudent raseal brought real tears

trumped up at my door, which would have
received the whole Mendieity Society. He

and I declare one day he looked not very
unlike your uncle, Lord Doneaster ''
A vivid flush passed over the whole fore-
head and features of Captain De crespigny
at these words; but assuming a sudden tone
of liveliness and vivaecity, he summoned Henry
to continue their entertainments for the even-
in, which were to be concluded by acting a
proverb, of which Sir Arthur and his guests
were to discover the design. Miss Smythe,
dressed in cottage costume, seated herself
expensive on a stool, after which Captain De
Crespigny, equipped with a bow in his hand,
and carrying on his back a quiver filled with
all the old pens in the house to represent a-
rows, entered in the character of Love, and

was about to aim his darts at the peasant
girl, when Henry, disguised in a tattoo old
cloak, to resonate poverty, limped slowly
into the room. On seeing this beggarly ap-
partition, Cupid, pushing his hair up till it
stood on end, assumed an expression of comic
horror, and with a shriek of dismay, rushed
to the window, as if about to jump out.
The whole party laughed heartily, and de-
clawed that the denouement of this piece con-
gained a most salutary lesson against a mere
love-match; and Sir Arthur said, for his own
part he would attend to the warning,-that
all motionless young ladies might consider
the case hopeless with him, and he trusted
every one present intended to be equally pre-
lent.
 Yos  most assuredly .'' exclaimed Cap-
tain De Crespigny. ``' I am almost tempted
now to take my uncle's advice, and propose to
my cousin, Miss Howard the heiress, though
love flies out of the window whenever I think
of her. She was a little pert, red-fingered,

memory of that girl often haunts me like a
night-mare since, for my poor mother on her
death-bed, got a promise made about our be-
ing married, or something of that kind. I
never heard the particulars, but I believe we
were to be made acquainted, and refuse one
another, before either of us could accept any
one else, but I should think there could be
little chance of anything that depended on
my being refused1'
Captain De Crespigny was bowing himself
off late in the evening, and taking a very par-
titular leave of Miss Smythe, having called
up all his most fascinating graces for the oe-
casino, while he felt inwardly gratified by the
pleasing conviction that another had been
added to the list of young ladies whom he
had made miserable for life, when he was
surprised to observe her mouth perfectly qui-
bering with suppressed laughter, and an arch
satirical gleam in her eye, for which would
not account, though it made him feel some-
what uncomfortable and dissatisfied. If it
were possible that any one could be laughing

at him, sho certainly was A world of most
intolerable ridicule appeared in her express-
sion,-an air almost of contempt and he
turned to leave the room with a feeling of
mortification and anger which he was ashamed
to allow even to himself.
When Captain De Crespigny hurriedly
opened the drawing-room door, near which
he and Caroline had been standing, he was
surprised to sco a person lurking close behind
it, who dartod instantly away and disappeared;
but before the intruder was out of sight, an
exclamation of terror and dismay escaped
from the lips of Caroline, who rushed towards
Sir Arthur, exelaiming in accents of almost
frantic alarm,'` He is thor he is there.

horrid, dreadful man: he is there stop him

Captain De Crespigny instinctively ran in
pursuit of the retreating figure, and eagerly
attempted to seize him, but the fugitive in-
stantaneouly opened the house door, and
escaped in the darkness, while, apparently to

intimidate his pursuer, he fired a pistol in the
air, and waved another above his head with
frantic gestures of rage and violence.
` It is beyond all measure extraordinary

Arthur, in discussing the event with an aspect
of gray perplexity. s My doors are most

most breathless agitation. `` One would ima-

watch Sometimes he used to make his pro-
since known by throwing a stone at our win-
does; often at midnight, by singing hoarsely
beneath them, and even occasionally by firing
a pistol in the air; but I did hope in this re-
mote corner we might have enjoyed peace and
safety. How are we ever to venture home.''
'I shall escort you with the whole party in
close phalanx,'' replied Sir Arthur, trying to
assume a rallying tono.  Old Martin and
myself are quite invulnerable, and I only wish
y secretary were also her, as he would be a
host in himself; but he is absent on a month's
leave, and for the first time in my life I miss

The night being impenetrably dark, and
not a sound to be heard but the echo of their
footsteps on the gravel, when Mrs Smythe
alighted from her carriage to walk across the
garden leading towards her house, Sir Arthur
immediately desired the servants to bring out
lights, when one of the candles having flared
p suddenly near Caroline, she thought she

perceived the madman close beside her, lurk-
in behind the stem of a large tree. The
dark shadows concealed all but his face,
in which there gleamed a look of maniaeal
triumph and salinity, while rushing close up
to Captain De Crespigny, he said in a threat-
ending tone, low and distinct, `` He who grosse
my path shall diel'' and instantly disappeared
through the hedge. Whan Miss Smythe, on
hearing his voice, with a stifled scream of ten-
ror led into the house, again that loud and
fiendish laugh, which she had already heard
once, arose behind her, and run through the
night air in tones of high delirium, causing a
cold shudder to thrill through the hearts of
even the boldest among her companions, while
they hastily followed her, and having placed
tho troubling girl in apparent safety, soon
after took leave, charging the servants to
chain and double-lock the door.
It was some hours before Caroline could
sufficiently compose her mind to retire; but af-
ter the house was perfectly quiet, and the ser-
wants in bed, sho sat up reading with the hope

that her nerves might become less painfully
agitated. Theslightest noise caused her part
to beat almost audibly, and she was conscious
that a mouse rattling in the wainscot would
have caused her to faint. Mrs Smythe could
scarcely be prevailed upon to leave her alone,
it as they both slept on the drawing-room
floor, only divided by a thin partition, Caro-
line induced her at a late hour to withdraw.
while not a sound now disturbed the deep re-
pose of nature, but ``the wailing sorrows of
some midnight bird.''
The moon had arisen, shining with softened
radiance into her apartment, when Miss
Smythe arose from her devotions, and she
could not but thinks at the moment what a
bright emblem of her divine Saviour that go-
riots luminary presented to the mind, not
glowing like the sun with a radianee which no
human eye can gaze upon, but reflecting upon
the darkened earth a mild subdued refulgenee,
perfectly suited for the steady contemplation
of those whom it had arisen to benefit and
cheer.

Nature was hush'd, ae iI her works adorn'd
The night-felt presence of creation's Lord.
Pleased with such thoughts, a gradual com-
posture stole over her senses, and Caroline at
length, seeing her candle nearly burned out,
consequently determined to retire for the
night. Not a sound was to be held in the
house, but her own light step, as she mo-
ed about the room,-the very opening of a
drawer, or the shutting of her book, sounded
nnnaturally loud, jarring upon her nerves with
a startling effect,-the shadows in the more
distant part of the room looked darker than
usual, and the least moan of the wind in-
erased the painful tension of her nerves to
agony. Scarcely had she begun to undress,
when a sudden noise not far off caused her to
start with eonvulsivo terror, her heart became
chilled with apprehension, the candlestick
which she carried in her hand fell to the
ground, the light was extinguished, and she
stood trembling and alone in total penetrate-
ble darkness.
238 MODERN FLIRTATIONS.
Caroline tried to persuade herself that the
sound must have been produced by her own
excited fancy,-she looked around and all was
quiet,-she listened and all was perfectly still.
-she reasoned with herself, and became re-
solute to try whether sleep might not plunge
her into forgetfulness and peace, when her
attention was accidentally attracted towards
one of the windows, where the bright moon-
beams rested on an object which seemed to
blast her eyes with horror, and paralyzed her
at once in a speechless agony of fear. The
top of a ladder rested on the window-sill,
upon the summit of which stood the dark
figure of a man, his face plastered so close
upon the glass, that his nose was perfectly
flattened against it, and his hands raised in a
menacing attitude towards her. he instant
he saw, by Caroline's look of frantic alarm,
that she had seen him, he dashed in the win-
low-frame by a single stroke of his powerful
ar, and seemed about to make a forcible en-
trance, when Miss Smythe, with the energy of

aloud in the sharp hill accents of despera-
tion for help.
The servants were speedily assembled around
her, and the instant sho felt herself in compa-
native safety, nature could sustain no more,
but, convulsed in every nerve, and throwing
herself into the arms of Mrs Smythe, with
a cry of thankfulness and agitation, she
fainted.
An instant alarm was given in the neigh-
boyhood,-a diligent search was made,-and
the police for several days exerted their ut-
most activity to detect the miscreant, but in
vain. Not a trace remained to convince Caro-
line that the whole had not been a hidden
dream, except that the ladder had been left
standing at her window, and turned out to
have been stolen from a neighbouring garden,
-the window-frame exhibited a frightful pio-
ture of devastation, being literally broken to
fragment,-and at some distance in the war-
den, a loaded pistol was discovered, perfectly

plans would be best adapted to ensure the

though she had almost put him out of his
senses already, yet he would rather make an
end of himself than of her.
Caroline dryly thanked him for his obliging
intentions on her behalf, and after a lively
dialogue, in which the gay huzzar actually es-
celled himself, in his fervent expressions of ad-
migration and regard, he tool leave, rather
wondering to think how he had been led on in
professing so much, and giving himself a lee-
ture as he rode home, on the propriety of be-
ginning to `` back out,'' seeing that he was
getting rather beyond his depth. Still there
were several of the reasons for meeting next
day, usual with those who have a natural
desire to improve an agreeable intimacy,--a
song to be practised,-a drawing to be admir-
ed,-and Miss Smythe having made a sort of
promise to let Captain Do Crespigny sit to

came irresistible. He had never yet entered
their own house, as meetings were always
hitherto arranged at Sir Arthur'a,  and a
slight feeling of curiosity likewise helped him
to the agreeable conclusion, that he must for

Punctual to he appointed hour, Captain
De Crespigny's groom rung a consequential
deal for his meter at the gate of Rosemount
Villa, such as had not been heard there since
bells were invented, and after a considerable
delay, the door was opened by a shabby awk-
ward-looking Irish girl, speaking with a pow-
early rogue, who eourtesyed with an appear-
ance of most preposterous respect to Captain
De Crespigny as he alighted, and pointed up
stairs, begging him to walk in, but without
having an idea apparently, that she ought her-
self to usher him into the drawing-room.

were equally singular, presenting that happy
mixture of the ruffian and the gentleman, not
very uncommon in Ireland. Attired in a mile-
tatry great-boat, he wore a most prepostcr-
ous pair of whiskers and mustaechios, long
coarse, and dirty, which looked as if they had
been curled over knitting wires. Taking the
last remnant of a cigar out of his mouth when
the visitor entered, and slowing not the small-
est surprise, with a smile which betrayed a lot
of dingy decayed teeth, and a very disfiguring
squint, he watched the approaching step of
Captain De Crespigny with a degag6 look of
indifference, saying in a one of easy familiarity.

A momentary pause ensued, during which

lip, in angry embarrassment, while, with a
Book of unutterable contempt and disgust, he
eyed his companion, who thrust his hands into
his ample pockets, and paced up and down
the room with rapid strides and determined
emphasis. At length, stopping opposite to
his irritated companion, he owed him for some
moments, with a look of stern reproach, say-
in, in a stronger Irish brogue than ever, and
with a torrent of indignation, which gave a-
most the dignity of eloquence to what he ut-
tered,

Captain De Crespigny began now to feel
seriously annoyed at his own position1 Not
having lately been quartered in Ireland, he
had forgotten how such affairs are managed
there, but at this moment a thousand recoil-
elections crowded upon him, of warnings he
had received from his brother officers respect-

exercised beside the Shannon, though most of
what they said, had been listened to with the

upon stories of ghosts and witchcraft. Here
he was, however, snared like a fly in a spider's
web, though without a single doubt of his
own powers to escape, and with no stronger
objection to all out this insolent ruffian be-
side him, than the publicity and ridicule
which he must inevitably incur, if involved in
a vulgar every-day duel with a hot-ended
irishman.
Seeing that the affair was likely to take a
graver turn than he had imagined, Captain
De Crespigny now slowly and resolutely
strode towards the hearth-rug, and turning
his back to the fire, in that attitude peculiar
to Englishmen, calmly and sternly looked in
the face of his insolent companion, whose lip
became compressed with an air of fierce de-
termination, while his dark eye littered with
a triumphant smile, and in an attitude of per-
fect oncalance, he returned Captain De

both looked equally angry, till the Irishman
at length opened a pocket-book, to which he
frequently afterwards referred, with a busi-

triumph, saying,

breath between his clenched teeth, while the
Irishman eye him with provoking coolness,
and merely muttered in reply, while still re-
fearing to the pocket-book,

as if some irresistible feeling had come over
him, which he could scarcely suppress, and
with a slight quiver in his voice, as if on the
very eve of laughter, though Captain Dc
Urespigny was too angry to notice it, he sang,
while looking out of the window, these words,
with very marked emphasis,-
Erin, out Erin'as the land of delight,
Where the women all love, and the end they all fight.'
At length, Captain De Crespigny, losing all
patience, followed his antagonist to the win-

Captain De Crespigny fixed his eyes with
stern contempt pon his free and easy com-
anion, who passed his fingers through his
long bushy wig, stretched his leg upon the
sofa, and spoke with a yawning voice, while
he added in a careless off-hand way, '`If my

Captain De Crespigny paused a moment,
irresolute what to do. It was a condensed-

ment's intercourse with such a man; and to
sign any paper at his request, seemed almost
a degradation; but then he saw before him
a long vista of vulgar annoyances from this
forward Irishman. He was aware that hun-
dress of gentlemen would Laugh, if the story
got any publicity, and that dozens of young
ladies would feel themselves aggrieved, if it
became circulated that his attentions had
been so very marked to an obscure Miss
Smythe.

and the mess, were all to be dreaded; and

Great was his surprise when defending
the staircase, to hear in the room he had so
recently left, a simultaneous burst of smother-

not be mistaken: It seemed even as if there
were female voices in the number; but al-
most bewildered with anger, and happy also
to osage, he hastened onwards, threw him-

hours before he had regained any portion of

tinted the dialogue during several minutes,
with great spirit and vivaity, till Henry sud-
denly became conscious, that in imagining the
words of another, he was gradually betrayed
into expressing his own real feelings, and that
too, with a depth and favour which sincerity
alone could have dictated.
Checking himself in a moment, while the
colour rushed to his face, dyeing it led to the
very roots of his hair, and instantly receded
again, he took a hurried leave of Mrs Smythe,
and turning to Caroline with a quivering lip,
he said, in a voice which none but herolf
could hear, ``I must not say in just what I

his haste accidentally thrown down, he began
hastily collecting its contents, when his sur-
prise was great, on turning up one sheet of
the drawing paper, to find there a finely-exe-
cited skoteh, done with all the skill and spirit
of an accomplished artist, representing the
venerable head of Sir Arthur; and on the
same paper-could it be possible -an al-
most living representation of himself. The
likeness very much flattered, he thought-
exceedingly flattered; but still it could be no
other; and the picture dropped from his
hand in the transport of his delight.
Henry again returned to the portfolio, hur-
riedly turning the leaves over; and amidst a
variety of superbly-finished miniatures, he
found his own countenance over and over
again grouped in animated contrast with that
of Sir Arthur. His heart throbbed with joy,
when, after hastily turning to the title-page.
he discovered, according to his hopes and
wishes, the name of Caroline Smythe; and

in for one moment, the pleasing, but per-

and on his part it is a mere boyish fancy,
which, if properly discouraged, will of itself
wear out.''
Henry had fled to avoid hearing what was
not intended For him, before Caroline replied,
in a low, agitated voice,

Though Caroline spoke these words in a

bitterness in her manner, as she turned away,
and oontemptuously threw upon the table a
massive gold chain which she usually wore,
saying, ``Lovers . IlI get fifty, and break the

one side, as Miss Granville would have re-

for the bitter taunts occasionally levelled at
her, and the tone of evident irritability in

the jealousy was mutual, attributing thought

a disposition was incapable. It may generally

from people wilfully taking offense, than from
people wilfully giving it: and there is quite
much ill-tempo in the one case as in the other.
Clara had suffered much on account of her
every inadvertent word or action being pur-
posely misconstrued; but she very properly
viewed the annoyance as a salutary lesson in
circumspection, before entering the great arena
of society, and mildly avoided all collision of
interests or opinions with Agnes, though her
whole powers of conciliation were more than
useless, if any attentions on the part of Sir
Patrick gave his sister reason to apprehend
that his affections might by possibility be en-
geged to her. Nothing could be more painful
irritating than the tone of contempt with
which Agnes `` spoke at' Clara respecting the
art and cunning with which some maneuvering

the matrimonial world, by making advances

almost entirely to visit Agnes, or to associate
with her.
. About the time when Mrs Smythe left Pon-
othello, Sir Patrick returned from spending a
month at Lady Towereliffe's in Fife, evidently
labouring under a depression of spirits very
unusual with him; and when Agnes, people-
ed by observing that he did not attempt to
throw off the cloud of melancholy, tinged very
strongly with ill-humour, which had so sud-
denly come over him, tried to guess or dis-
cover the cause, she found it for some time
impossible to gain a glimpse of the truth,
though she asked as many questions as

handsomest and most agreeable man in their
circle of society, living only for the enjoyment
of the senses and the happiness of the present
hour, while he thought it too long a look-out
to anticipate what might happen the day

reputation, a vague understanding seemed to
prevail that all was not right, yet no explicit
explanation seemed ever to be obtained.
Something there was- what, non presumed to say,

There are not only faults in the very best
characters, but redeeming qualities also in the
very worst, and with much selfishness, the
result of a perverted education, the handsome
and fascinating Sir Patrick had naturally a
good temper and exeitable affections, though
these were won up occasionally to the
wildest excess, while his fortune was not more
recklessly squandered than his attachment in

living mortal so depraved as to be without

speed or the other, will only be perfected in
an eternal world. It often seems to an ob-
server, as if two opposite beings had been
kneaded into one, since qualities so contradict-

Though Sir Patrick Dunbar was eager and
rapacious in acquiring money, and would in-
eur any meanness to avoid paying it, he seem-
ed, nevertheless, lavish, and what some people
is-called generous, in squandering what he
called his own. Though cold and selfish in
general, some fine impulses had been in his
nature, which proved him capable of veto-
ment, persevering, and passionate attachment,
where his affections, or rather his fancy, had
been one engaged; while, at the same time,
he was more ashamed to testify any feeling
than he would have been to commit a crime,
and endeavoured to blind people towards
that sensibility which was in reality the re-
deeming point in his character, by talking

ridicule of all those for whom he might have
been supposed to feel the weakness of a real

and his heart, till now hermetically sealed
against all real confidence and friendship,
was now for the first time unolosod, in its in-
most recesses, while even his haekneyed mind
seemed to catch a ray of light and warmth
from the sunny freshness and purity of Clara's
intellectual mind. Her intelligent converse-
tion, enlivened by a vein of sly pleasing
humour, had completely taken him by sur-
prise, being as fresh and gentle as a summer
breeze, while her appearance, so young, timid,
and lovely, caused the eye to rest on her with
a sentiment of almost melancholy interest.
Clara had only emerged from school, finally.
a few days before Sir Patrick met her at
Lady Towereliffe's, and her extreme native

named by her melancholy songs and thought-
ful conversation.
1o lara, Sir Patrick had only hitherto
been known as a school companion of her
brother's, but so conscientiously did Richard
Granville invariably abstain from oil-speak-
in, that, even where justice might have war-
ranted the severest censure, he merely became
silent. It is observable that, in the wisdom of
Providence, nothing is made in vain. Even
the very weeds that number our path have,
when under proper restraint, their important
uses, and in the mind of man, the tendency
implanted by nature, to discuss and criticize
the conduct of others, has, when properly ex-
ercised, its own advantages, by acting as a
salutary restraint on the conduct of those
who would otherwise do evil with impunity,
and by also giving a timely warning, and
hanging out a beacon-light to those who
would otherwise trust their interest and hap-
pines where such confidence was unmerited,
and where all contact is dangerous.

Captain De Crespigny's tilting propensities
were the less dangerous, from their being so
generally discussed in society, as few were
willing that the unwary should suffer, rather
than his faults be exposed to censure; but
Mr Granville, by not giving his sister timely
warning against the dissipated extravagance
and almost infidel principles of his old school-
companion, had now unfortunately exposed
her to a danger he had not anticipated, as it
never occurred to his imagination, in its wild-
est fancies, that the reckless dissolute Sir
Patrick, who had long sneered at marriage,
and even broken that holy tie for others,
might find a charm in the pure, calm, high-
minded Clara, which raised him above his
ordinary self, and made him appear all she
could most like or admire. During their
earlier intercourse she saw nothing in his con-
operation to disapprove, because Sir Patrick
most unintentionally deceived her into a be-
lief of his being very different from what
he really was, owing to the respect with
which he treated all her opinions, and only

when he talked to others did she become
startled occasionally by the tone of careless
defiance with which he spoke of all those per-
sons and things which she was most accuse-
timed to reverence and esteem. Before long
his attachment hud become so unbounded
that, conscious he could not obtain Clara's
hand if sho know his real character, he as-
sued all that seemed most likely to secure
her confidence, and, for the pleasure of being
with her, attended church regularly on Sun-
day at the village. Clara was astonished at
is evident ignorance of the forms of devo-
tion: yet knowing his education has been
finished by a clergyman, she supposed he
must have imbibed a due respect for the or-
finances; while Lady Towercliffe, indulging
her usual jobbing propensities, was enchanted
to make up a match of any kind in her own
house, and praised Sir Patrol us the most
immaculate and perfect of men.
Clara's intimacy with Sir Patrick had been
continually increasing for some time, before
his attention became so very obvious as to ex-

cite her peculiar interest, or to make her con-
serious of a necessity for inquiring into the
state of her own heart; but, upon doing so,
she became instantly aware of the deep hold
he had acquired over her thoughts and flee-
tionas. His frank, of-hand, good-humoured
manner had pleased her, his amusing convert-
sutton had enlivened her, and at length his
ardent professions of attachment interested
her deeply, being expressed with all the elo-
quenee of natural feeling.
Clara, in the gloomy recesses of Mrs Pen-
fold's school-room, had learned nothing of the
world, and her heart at once, therefore, en-
lower Sir Patrick with all those amiable
qualities which he assumed, while she yielded
herself to the most pleasing of all earthly
dreams, that of loving and being beloved by
one who seemed to deserve and to return her
attachment; while her sole hesitation in a-

while many poor tradesmen have already been
ruined by his extravagance, and he has openly
entered into a perfect crusade against religion
and morality. In short, my dear Clara, Sir
Patrick is by no means to be trusted with the
happiness of another, and least of all with
yours, being a confirmed rose, still pursuing
the very wildest career of unprineipled dis-

IPad the grave opengl at Clara feet, she
could scarcely have been more startled and
astonished, than by the contents of this most
unforeseen letter, the first unwelcome line ever
received from Richard. She could have borne
anything but to find her lover unprineipled or
unworthy, and a wintry hill seemed to a-
the round her heart, while, with a stifled
groan which struggled for utterance, she cover-
ed her face with her hand, and sank back
upon a sofa. By a powerful effort Clara pre-
served herself from fainting,-she was resolved
not to faint, and she did not,-but in the
secret chamber of her heart, all was darkness,
loneliness, and grief. Visions of earthly hap-

pines had littered for a time in brightest
colouring before her mind, but now they must
be blotted out by her tears. They all lay
prostrate and disfigured at her feet, search-
ed and blasted as if by lightning, and her
heart, bewildered by a multitude of thought
and emotions, seemed full almost to burst
ing.
Clara wept many bitter tears over her let-
her, and she not only wept but acted. With-
out delay, Clara prepared to return to the
relation with whom, during her brother's ab-
since, she usually found a home; and before
her departure, not only wrote to Sir Patrick,
stating in terms of touching grief, all her rea-
sons for so suddenly and unwillingly withdraw-
in from her engagement to him; but she had
a long and most afflicting interview with him,
vainly endeavouring to convince her lover, that
their total incompatibility of sentiment raised
a barrier between them, which forbade the
possibility of their union.

comprehend why his talking carelessly, or even
contemptuous of religion, should in any d-
gree affect the preference which she had once
confessed for him, and which he felt assur-
ed she still entertained. With passionate

tested that she, and the only, could complete

done, I ventured my all of worldly happiness
on that one stake, and have lost it; but there

Si Patrick clenched his hands vehement-
ly together, while his countenance burned
and muttering a curse between his teeth,
which chilled the blood of Clara in her veins,
he walked about the room with rapidly in-
erasing excitement, till at length, stopping
before her, he said in accents of angry re-
roach, `` You have spoken my doom, Clara;
and only from your own lips would I have
believed it'
Clara buried her face in her hands, and
feeling that her high-wrought fortitude was
giving way, she hurried towards the door;

it, Sir Patrick again seized her hand, saying,

she, still hastening away. Be happy in
making others happy. May you yet find one
who loves you as I have done, and who shall

all the good I hear. Farewell''
No words could do justice to the silent
agony of Car's young heart, when in solitary
grief she retraced her whole intimacy with Sir
Patrick, and reflected that she had bid a last
adieu to one whom she must not esteem, and
yet could not but love. All that this world
could offer she had rejected for conscience
sake. A cold frost seemed to gather around
her spirit, while trembling and depressed, she
viewed the desolation of all her lately cherish-

happiness, she now seemed like some solitary

Marion Dunbar, fresh in the spring-tide of
youthful bloom, had nearly completed her
seventeenth year, and was hurrying on still
in a whirlpool of education at Mrs Penfold's,
exciting herself more zealously for the credit
of her teachers than she ever would have done
for her own.
One evening about this time, a message
reached Marion, desiring that she would in-
distant hasten to Mrs Penfold's private sit-

easions that lady's hall of. audience, and a
solemn summons to which was usually of omi-
nous import. Marion, however, conscious
that her own recent diligence had been quite
pre-eminent, and her success most dustin-
guished, heard the word of command with a
flutter of pleasing anticipation, for to her the
future was always full of hope. Too old now
for medals and ribbons, she yet indulged in
the gay recollection of former triumphs, ad
remembered, with a smile, as she hurried up
stairs, how often Sir Arthur had formerly de-
clawed, while pretending to frown upon her
that ``he hated to see girl founding about
with medals, and defying the world'' yet how
silly, when she one day entered his drawing-
room, with deepening colour, and a look of
inodest consciousness, half concealing and
half displaying her honours, he had advanced
to meet her, wearing his own Grand Cross of
the Bath, to provo, as he said, that he was
indeed fit company for so meritorious a young
lady.
302 MODERN FLIRTATIONS.
Humming a favourite air, with a buoyant
joyful step, and radiant smile, Marion hasten-
el to the door of MIrs Penfold's apartment,
where, after trying to compose her features
into a suitable expression of sober respect,
with dumpling cheek, and still almost laugh-
ing eyes, sho entered, making, as she had been
taught, to usual respectful courtesy exacted
by Mrs Penfold, such as might have been suit-
able for an introduction at Court, or for a
public performer receiving the plaudits of a
numerous audience, and then, with a bright
speaking look, full of hope and vivaeity, she
paused, to ascertain the object of her unex-
peeled summons.
To Marion's astonishment and dismay, Mrs
Penfold was paying about the room, evidently
in a state of furious irritation, while in her
hand she curried that endless bill, the growth
of many years, for board, education, masters,
and sundries, which had so often already
greeted the unwilling eyes of her young pu-
pil, whose whole inward spirit reeoiled with
shame and apprehension, while sho silently

by heart, and could almost have recapitulated
without a prompter.
Had Marion herself been a ruined diameter
or a spendthrift, she could scarcely have felt
more guilty and ashamed than now; but af-
ter standing an entire minute without being

Unable to speak from consternation, though
suel scenes were already but too familiar to
her memory, MArion fixed her eyes on the un-

tents, while her thoughts were in the mean time
painfully occupied in devising what would be
right for her to say or do in this unexpected
crisis. A long pause ensued, during which

therefore Marion, with a strenuous effort, on-
devoured to new-string her nerves, and say
something, while the large heavy tears forced
themselves into her eyes.

MArion's heart was melted by oven this
very slight expression of regard, and nothing
could exceed the troubled beauty of her eyes
when she raised them gratefully to Mrs lPen-

exactly the place for a scene, as that lady had
long been considered incapable of a year or a

quivering with agitation, till at length she
closed her eyes in speechless agony, bewilder-
ed by the sudden transition from joyful anti-

heard of difficulties and bankruptcies, as she
had heard of the plague or the bow-string at
Constantinople-things dreadful to those who
might be affected by them, but quite foreign
to herself, and naw, like a clap of thunder, all
had suddenly burst over the heads of those
who were nearest and dearest to her, with a-

Mrs Penfold most heartily seconded her
pupil's desire to depart, while one of the head-
vest pangs which Marion had to endure on
this occasion, sprang from the stern angry
boldness with which her ci-levant preceptrcse
appeared about to bid her a last farewell.
A tumult of gossiping wonder and cn-
priority arose among the pupils, when it be-
cae whispered that Marion was to `` leave''
on an hour's notice. Many questions were
asked, much astonishment was expressed, and
even a great deal of real sympathy excited,
but Marion shrank from the glamorous ex-
reclamation of her young companions, who
would not so much as guess the measure and
depth of her misfortunes. Often had she
shared their sorrows, and willingly would she
have accepted any consolation they could
offer, but the worst of her trials could not be
spoken to mortal ears, and in lamenting for
her brother's disgrace, she would only bear

her wound, like a stricken deer, into solitude
and silence.
There are insects that live a life-time in an
hour, and it seemed to Marion as if she had
really done so, since the time when sparkling
with gladness, she flew to Mrs Penfold's pre-
since. Now, heavy with sorrow and anxiety,
she slowly retraced her steps, and on reach-
in her room, sank upon the bed in a parox-
yem of tears, delivering herself up to many
painful thoughts, or rather to her feelings, for
she could not think amidst the tumult of an
agitated mind, when suffering thus under the
most painful of all transitions, from hope t
despair.
It was during the unoccupied half-hour
after dinner, when Mrs Penfold allowed her
pupils a gas of rest from their labours du-
ring the day, that they gathered in groups at
every window, to criticise a hackney-coach
and very tired broken-down looking horses in
waiting, while the pupils all watched for Ma-
lion's departure, anxious to catch a last
glimpse of their favourite companion. She

herself in packing up her few possessions.
while endeavouring to compose her mind,
both of which tasks occupied more time than
sho wished or expected. But all was now
over, and trying to assume an aspect of se-
renity, with pale cheeks and swollen yes, she
entered the school-room, carrying in her
and a large and very heavy-looking casket.
The young community crowded round to
say a thousand affectionate farewells, who,
for a moment, MArion looked at them all
with her own beautiful smile, but unable to
control her emotion, she turned away her
head, and burst into an agony of tears.

MARIo Dunbar being by no means an arrant
novel reader, knew nothing of those artificial
feelings which too often obliterate the reality.
Simple as a field-flower, her natural sensing-
city remain perfectly fresh and unimpaired,
while now, for the first time, experiencing the
withering disappointments, and blighting anx-
ieties of life.
As she drove slowly along towards the
sanctuary where Sir Patrick had taken re-

fuge, the most prominent apprehension on
her mind, was that of finding him on the eve
of imprisonment; but she in some degree
eonsoled herself by imagining the services
that in such circumstances she might perhaps
be able to do him, and the privations she
could endure for his sake. The more proud,
overbearing, and arbitrary, he had hitherto
been, the more touching it appeared to her
affectionate spirit, that one who seemed born
to command, should now be so humbled; and
impatiently did she long to prove, that, he-
ever all things might alter, yet, in prosperity
or adversity, in sickness or in health, she was
unchangeably the same; while her young
heart glowed with the paramount hope of at
last becoming useful to her brother, and
therefore welcome.
As she proceeded, visions of deep distress
and difficulty floated dimly through the end
of Marion, who could not entirely close her
eyes against the iron truths, and stern real-
ties of life, while considering how totally un-
suited her brother was, to endure the pri-

nation of a single luxury, and now he would
scarcely have enough to command the most
ordinary neeessarios.
In the mind of Marion, immediate starve-
tion, and going out as a governess, were the
two ideas that most prominently connected
themselves with the consciousness of being
ruined; for hor conception of bankruptcy
was of the most terrifying description.
In the few novels she had for seen, the
heroines could always support themselves by
selling their drawings; but Marion did not
hope to gain an independent livelihood by
hoar slanting castles, and top-heavy trees,
though taking in plain work, or teaching
music, suggested themselves as possible re-
sources. Marion thought of arrests, bailiffs,
writs, and of the world come to an end.

The slow-moving haekney-each stopped at
last before the gate of Sir Patrick's new rest-

villa near Holyrood House, with gabled win-
dos, stone balconies, richly cared balls-

beech-trees, and formal yew hedges, i clipped
into fifty unimaginable shapes. Marion was
surprised, on hastily lighting, to perceive the

In a tumult of motion, Marion, throwing
off' her bonnet, rushed up a broad well-lighted
flight of stairs, while, wound up to a pitch
of heroism and toronto self-devotion, she
thought only of her brother, impatiently long-
in to fly into his arms, and to express the
whole fulness of her affection, and the whole
depth of her sympathy. While her heart
sprang forward to meet him, she eagerly
threw open a door next the staircase, and
entered with a hurried and tremulous step;
but suddenly her eyes were dazzled and be-
bewildered by the sight which met her agitated
glance, while for a moment she became root-
of to the floor, like one who had been stunned
by a sudden blow. Marion gazed without
seeing, and heard without knowing what was
said, so unexpected and surprising was the
scene to which she had thus suddenly intro-
ducey herself.
A murmur of noise and gaiety rang in her
ears, while the whole apartment was brilliant-

ly illuminated, and the first object which be-
came distinct to her vision was Sir Patrick,
seated at the -head of  superbly-decorated
dinner-table, in a perfect uproar of merriment
and hilarity. Around him were played five or
six of his gayest associates, dressed in their
scarlet hunting-boats, and evidently in joyous
spirits, like school-boys during the vacation,
while the whole party presented a most con-
vivian aspect, laughing in merry chorus, and
with claret circulating at full speed round the
hospitable board.
Marion felt as if her feet had lost all power
of motion, while, gasping the handle of the
door with one hand, and shading her eyes
with the other, she became transfixed to the
spot. It was a shock of unexpected joy, and
while standing in the deep erasure of
the door, her large eyes dilated, and her
lips parted, with an expression of speech-
less amazement, she looked like a breath-
ing portrait, which an artist might have
shown as his master-piece,-young, bright,
and graceful, as the first crescent of the
322 MoDERN FLIRTAIONS.
moon, or like the fabled hours of an eastern
tale.
The gentlemen all instinctively stood up
with one accord the moment she appeared,
giving her looks of embarrassed astonish-
ment and admiration, while Marion hastily
retreating, in an agony of confusion, heard
her own voice inadvertently exclaim, `` Pat-
riek t'
 MArion l'' cried her brother, in a frenzy
of astonishment more than equal to her own,
while the flowing bumper which had been
raised to his lips remained suspended there,
and in an instant afterwards, his tone of sur-
prise became changed into angry imperative
remonstranee. `' MArion 1 what brought you

Before she had quite retreated, suspecting
the real state of the case, and not wishing for
any public explanation, Sir Patrick added, in
an accent of careless good-humour, `` Agree

quite fair that others should-not pay at all.

In that case there can be no mistake1 I long

price. Happiness is to be bought, like every-

The softening effect of happiness on stern

of astonishment than of pleasure, and was
mingled much more with censure than with

to dispose of himself at so great a sacrifice.''

A loud and startling crash at this moment
interrupted Agnes' delightful reminiscences.
Marion instinctively sprang from her seat with
alarm, and looked hastily round, when she
perceived that Dixon had tripped over and
thrown down a table covered with china o-
laments, on which Miss Dunbar had frequent-
ly squandered half her income, even at times
when she could scarcely afford a dress. The
etiquette being now established that all young
Radios, of whatever means, shall cultivate a
passion for china and hot-house plants, Agnes
had made a collection of second-rate vases.,
and third-rate tea-cups, interspersed with
stunted hyacinths and drooping camellias, at
so great an expense that Sir Patrick often re-
commended her to take a wing of the bazaar
and sell off' all her trampery again. The whole
assortment now lay in fragments on the floor,
MOdERN FLIRIATIONS. 363
while Agnes delivered herself up to agonies of
lamentation, seolding, and wondering, over the
run of her hoarded treasures, while she point-
ed out with consternation, how nearly the
table had fallen with its edge upon her own
foot, which might have named her for life.
THe `` fall of china'' is a proverbial trial of
temper, and that of Agnes did not prove on
this occasion invulnerable, while the epithets,
``awkward wretchl'' and `'stupid idiotS'' were
audibly lavished on the offending abigail
Marion appeared exclusively occupied in
gathering up the scattered fragments of china,
and arranging them together, but her eye was
secretly observing Dixon, the strange wild ex-
pression of whose features filled her with in-
definite apprehension. In her countenanee
there gleamed, certainly, for an instant, a dark
smile of malignant satisfaction. Marion felt
sure that it was so Could the poor creature's

exclaimed Agnes, disconsolately, `` How could

for MArion felt a nervous consciousness that
DIxon was not far off, and might attempt to

the star after she concluded, but Marion,
thoroughly engrossed with the subject, reiter-
mated once more her conviction that there had
been something more than common in the
manner of Dixon, whom she advised Agnes to
watch very carefully, if she did not part with
her soon.

Sm PrICE, like most men who are gifted

such generous emotions and exalted affections

or of causing offence, being perfectly reckless

refreshing to a mind so hackneyed as his, and
though he often clocked her sensitive spirit
in its full flow of affectionate confidence, by
a retort courteous, or rather diseourteous, he
was nevertheless vain of the admiration she
invariably excited, and read, in the eyes of
others, the value he ought to place on her
beauty and talents.
Agnes' whole mind was so frothed over
with folly, and encrusted with selfishness, that
unless the wheel of fortune touched upon her
personal comforts, she was as impervious to all
external impressions as a tortoise beneath the
shell, and it was a useless waste of generous
sentiments and kind emotions, whenever the
heart of MArion was laid open to her. Agnes,
who had long since adopted a company man-
ner, and even a company voice, persuaded her-
solf that Marion also, had very cleverly `` got
up'' a character on some imaginary model of
excellence, which she acted over to the very
life. It seemed to her a naked certainty that

though the radianece of her intellect, and the
sensibility of her eye,. were but in harmony
with hor actions, all testifying disinterested
self-denial and invariable affection, still Agnes
convinced herself that Marion lied `` for
effect.''
If Marion ever acted a part at all, it was
only in concealing from those who might have
ridiculed her, the unfathomable depth of her
feelings, since she might as well have asked
for sympathy from an ice-berg as from Agnes.
Knowing that every evidence of sensibility
would be received withsceepticism, she silently
and hopefully waited till some scope might be
afforded her for testifying that all which she
might have wished to profess, was nothing to
what she would do or suffer for those she
loved; and if eer Marion refined at any one
circumstance in her lot, it was, that she might
perhaps pass through life unknown to those
she loved the best, because she dared not ex-
press, even by a few insignificant words, that
affectionate attachment to Agnes and Sir

One privilege of friendship Marion enjoyed

always administer some gentle anodyne to the
irritated sufferer, and displayed a wonderful

the very pride and haughtiness of his spirit ren

when he seemed at all subdued, and on the
evening of Lady Towerelife's ball, she could

ious mind, and a prayer, even more fervent
than usual, for his happiness.
In one house, Marion was understood and
loved as sho wished to be, and all her young
enthusiasm found its best refuge and welcome
in the aged heart of Sir Arthur, who felt re-
fresher and cheered by the companionship of
thoughts and feelings as fresh and natural

during his early breakfast, and gayle antici-
paying the look of joyful surprise and people-
it with which she would be welcomed, while
she rehearsed in her own happy mind, how
best to increase Sir Arthur's astonishment.
The day was indeed one of mutcehless beauty,
the sunshine perfectly superb, and all around
resplendent with light, gaiety, and happiness

spirits.
 Ad now, while bloom and breeze their charms unite,
And all is glowing with a rich delight,
God1 who cn tread upon the breathing ground,

The hole air seemed full of incense and
poetry when the light-footed Marion, with a
bounding and elastic step, set forth on her
solitary walk towards Portobello, joyous as a
bird in spring, pleased with the whole world.,
and admiring everything with a lightness of
heart that cast its sunshine on all she saw.
Marion delighted in a wild knee of liberty
now, when she contrasted it with her long
years of endurance at Mrs Penfold's; and
equipped in exactly such a pinks gingham
dress as Agnes had censured on Clara Gran-
ville, with the free air, like liquid sunshine,
playing about her glowing cheek, and hen
light ringlets fluttering in the breeze, the ex-
excitement of her spirits became such that she
could have run with pleasure across the discord
meadows, and, `` glad as the wild bee on his

und stepped in dew.
Marion had picked some flowers as fresh
and blooming as herself, while she hurried
through the more inhabited parts of the san-
tuary, but when passing beneath the palace
windows, her steps were arrested for a mo-
sent by hearing the sounds of birth and
musio. `` Can it be'' thought she, in auto-
punishment, `` Lady Towereliffe's ball is yet at
its zenith I
Pitying the dangers much more than she
envied them, Marion looked at the scene of
glorious beauty around her, and was hurrying
forward, humming a light barcarolle in eon-
cert with the thousand birds in full chorus on
every side, when suddenly a loud shout ears-
of her to start and turn round. Marion now
perceived with astonishment that a window
of Lady Towercliffle's apartments had been
hastily opened, and Sir Patrick stood on th
balcony waving his handkerchief impetuously

, for her to stop, and a moment afterwards she
saw him eagerly running after her across the
fields without his hat.
' Marion you lucky girl stop there''
exclaimed he with breathless animation.

young lady more to make up a last qundrille,
so come along; you are my prisoner? What
makes you look aghast? Who ever heard

` Patrick, you are certainly made'' said
Marion, unable to help laughing at the almost
delirious eagerness of his manner. ` Pray

that you shall dance for me1 Now, fling that

Unable to resist the out-burst of her bro-
the's extravagant mirth, yet shrinking and
abashed, almost ready to try with vexation,
Marion was unwillingly lcd, or almost drag-
gel by her laughing persecutor into the draw-
in-room, where, with a look of niece, and
an aspect lovely in the first blush and fresh-
ness of girlhood, she gazed in mute astonish-
ment and almost with dismay at this her first
peep into the great world of fashion, wishing
for her own part that she could have adopted
invisibility, and enjoyed the scene as if she
were in a private box at the theatre, for as
yet her feelings were `` trop pres de la peine
peur the un plaisir.''
A bright sunshine streamed into the room,
while the gas lamps still dimly glared over
the breakfast table, at present surrounded by

three or four hot, flushed, dusty-looking
young ladies, with exaggerated colours, soiled
dresses, torn gloves, withered bouquets, and
exceedingly disordered triangles, falling in
dishevelled masses over their naked shoulders.
These ladies, assuming forced spirits, and an
appearance of over-done gayety, kept up a
rattling, flippant dialogue with about twice or
three times the number of gentlemen, some in
glittering uniforms, padded and stuffed to the
very chin, and others in plain clothes, but all
over-heated, over-excited, and over-fatigued,
while, in spite of parched lips and blood-shot
eyes, they were still endeaouring, with all
their might, to be fascinating.
T6 Marion's unaecustomed eye the whole
party seemed like a lot of second-rate actors
from the theatre, not calculated, by their
aspect, to elicit very rapturous applause, and
she privately wondered they were not sham-
ed to look each other in the face when in so
ridiculous a plight. Even Agnes, her own
beautiful sister, looked very unlike Agnes
and sho felt astonished to find that it might

actually be possible to spend an hour in her
company and not be admiring hcr, but in
Marion's very private opinion, her appearance
was now as if some sign-post painter had
done a resemblance of her sister in the very
coarsest colouring, and in the most ever-done
style of dress and expression.
Agnes had a great deal to say, and no fifth-
dence to prevent her saying it all, therefore
she was now plunged into the midst of a very
animated dialogue with Captain Do Crew-
piggy, talking with a look of conscious beauty
and conscious success, in the only style she
could talk, nonsense, and making a lavish ex-
expenditure of smiles, attitudes, and reclaim-
tions, to give herself the appearance of viva-
city. Her hair was in a most disastrous
state, and her complexion everything but
what it should be, while her dress had so
completely fallen off at the shoulders, that she
might appropriately have sung her favourite
air, `` One struggle more, and I am free'
The expression of Agnes' oountenance be-
came at one perfectly natural, when she

turned round, and for the first time observed,
with a start of genuine astonishment, that
Marion was beside her, looking at the mo-
ent like some being of a better world, or
like a grateful water-lily rearing its pure and
beautiful head above the turbid pool.
Marion glanced at her sister in a state of
smiling embarrassment, as if dosirous to claim
her protection amidst a scene so new and
strange, and taking possession, with a con-
finding look, of Agnes' arm, joy seemed rush-
in out of her bright animated eyes, and
dumpling in her cheek, when, under her
sister's protection, she gazed around with an
expression of timid amusement and curiosity.
: MInrion, what mad freak is trial'' ex-
claimed Agnes, with a hot red blush of angry
surprise; `' Patrick, do take her home''
: Not till she has been my eis d is in this
quadrille, and then we must all disperse,'' re-

laugh, while noticing a haughty flash pass
swiftly over the bow of Agnes; `` I had diD-

replied Captain De Crespigny, with an admir-

downcast eyes shaded with their long deep
fringes, while an arch young smile played
round her mouth, and dimpled her cheek.

copied Captain Do Orespigny in everything,
from the pattern of his watch-chain to the
choice of his partners.
Agnes felt invariably more astonished at
suny deficiency of attention, than at the most
devoted assiduity, having accustomed herself
to believe that she was always the first object
of interest to every gentleman in the room,
though diffidenee or caution might cause them
to exercise their self-denial for a time, by
keeping aloof; and it was with more room-
admiration for Captain De Crespigny's privy-
tion in losing her, than for her own, that she
accepted the school-boy Peer as a partner,
while secretly amused and flattered by the
ludicrous expression of two and admiration
with which he usually offered himself. Hay-

quadrille and several reals, the clock struck

MODERN FLIRTATIONS. 388
Captain De Crespigny, after uttering, as
usual, in his most ingratiating manner, a mil-
lion of absurd nothings, took a sentimental
leave of Marion, saying, with his very best
smile, and a high to correspond, `"` I shall al-
ways remember this evening with pleasure-
always Ten minutes of unmixed happiness
are something in this world to be thankful for
Life has nothing more delightful '
These words were said in his usual gay,
off-hand tone, while Captain De Crespigny
felt perfectly charmed to think what an im-
pression they must be making on the heart of
his young and unsophisticated partner. He
was at the same time astonished himself, to
find on this occasion how much more his heart
was on his lips than it had ever been before.
Marion was the only girl Captain De Crew-
1piggy had yet seen whom he did not feel a wish
to trifle with; for during the last half hour,
he had been not only amused, but deeply in-
interest, by discovering in her conversation a
degree of matured reflection, of united, hu-
tour, and good-sense, accompanied by bright-
384  MIODEN FLIRTATION.
necks of expression in her deeply-speaking eyes,
much in contrast with what he had over boen
accustomed to before. Nothing is so rare in
manner as to be perfectly natural, without a
weapon of affeetation; and to this charm was
added another, quite as he and unexpected
to Captain e Orcspigny, though by no means
so acceptable, as ho became not only auto-
wished, but piqued, at the gay, indifferent
carelessness, with which Marion hoard, ae
words of course, not more belonging to her,
that if they had been addressed to any one
else, his well-turned compliments and insinu-
aged admiration.
Not to be mct half-way was new and auto-
wishing to Captain De Crespigny? It seemed
perfectly unaccountable, little as he knew to
long his character for a ruthless flirt had been
placarded before the eyes of Marion, who no
more credited the sincerity of his professions
now, than if he had been an actor performing
on the stage. She considered that it was his
part for the evening to scatter oivilities india-
criminally around him, while his real feelings

were, she believed, privately consecrated to
one, and to one only. Marion's own heart
was in armour, protected by the belief of Cap-
tain De Crespigny bring her affianced brother;
and therefore she received his adieu with a
quiet demure look, succeeded by an area smile,
as the idea crossed her mind how completely
she was in the secret of his attachment, and
how little he seemed to guess that she was.
When Captain De Crespigny observed
Marion's good-humoured careless manner in
taking leave of him, he began to fancy it just
possible she might still be quite indifferent to
his attentions; but he rather indignantly re-
solved that this should not continue long. It
would be a distinction, he knew, to follow in
the train of a young beauty so admired as he
saw that Marion must be; for a hundred
tongues were already talking around him of
her matehless loveliness, while he alone had
yet enjoyed an opportunity of discovering,
that much as she was to be admired by those
who saw her, she was still more to be loved
by those who knew her; for she seemed to

unite in herself all that he had over praised in
a thousand others before, though he carried
no plummet in his mind fitted to measure the
depth of hers. Captain De Crespigny had
been accustomed, hitherto, always to feign
more than he felt; but now, for' the first time,
he found it necessary to conceal, even from
himself, the extent of his feelings; for it
seemed as if the last few hours had rendered
Million perfectly known, and for ever dear to
him. Slowly strolling homewards, therefore,
he gave vent to his thoughts, by singing, in a
voice like moonlight, soft and clear, the words
of a favourite song:-
 nd fare thee well, may only joel
And of the wIn a wHile
And I will coe again my Love,
lough it were ten thousand mile.''
