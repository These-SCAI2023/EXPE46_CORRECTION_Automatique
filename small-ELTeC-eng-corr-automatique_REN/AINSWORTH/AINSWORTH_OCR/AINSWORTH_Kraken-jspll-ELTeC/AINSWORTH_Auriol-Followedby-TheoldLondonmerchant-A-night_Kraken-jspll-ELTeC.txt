preIiogue-16o.
ThE Sixteenth Century drew to a close. It was the last
day of the last year, and two hours any were wanting to
the birth of another year and of another century.
The night was solemn and beautiful. Myriads of san
paid the deep vault of heaven; the crescent moon hung
like a silver lamp in the midst of them; a stream of rosy
and quivering light issuing from the north traversed th
sky, like the tail of some splendours poet; while from
its point of affluence broke forth, ever and anon, chorus-
tions thrilling in splendour and variety of hue the most
brilliant discharge of fireworks.
A sharp frost prevailed; but the atmosphere was clear
and dry, and neither wind nor snow aggraated the whole-
some rigour of the season. The water lay in thick con-
sealed masses around the conduits and well, and the
buekets were frozen on their stands. The thoroughfare

were seated with ice, and dangerous to horsemen and
vehicles; but the doorways were firm and pleasant to the
tread.
Hero and there, a fire was lighted in the streets, round
which ragged chains and mendicants were collected, roast-
ing fragments of meat stuck upon iron prongs; or qunffing
deep draughts of metleglin and ale, out of leathern cups
Crowds were collected in the open places, watching the
wonders in the heavens, and drawing augurics from them,
chiefly sinister, for most of the shoulders thought the signs
portended the speedy death of the queen, and the advent
of a new monarch from the north-a safe and easy inter-
relations, considering the ancient age and declining health
of the illustrious Elizabeth, together with the known a-
prominent of her successor, James of sCotland.
Notwithstanding the early habits of the times, few persons
had retired to rest, an universal wish prevailing among the
citizens to see the new year in, and welcome the century no-
companion it. Lights glimmered in most windows, re-
healing the holly-sprigs and laurel-leads stuck thickly in
their diamond panes; while, whenever as dor was opened, n
ruddy gleam burst across the street; and a glance inside
the dwelling showed its inmates either gathered round the
glowing hearth, occupied in mirthful sports-fox-i'-th'-
hole, blind-man's-buff, or shoe-the-mare-or seated at the
male board grouning with Christmas check.

with ribands and rosemary, and filled with a drink called
``lamb's-wool,'' composed of sturdy ale, smeetenel with
sugar, spiced with minute, and having toasts and but
years floating within it,-a draught from which seldom
brought its pretty bcarers less than a great, and occasion-
ally a more valuable join.
Such was the igil of the year Sixteen Hundred.
On this night, and at the tenth hour, a man of striking
and venerable appearance was sccn to emerge upon a small
wooden balcony, projecting from a bay-window near the top
of a picturesque structure situated at the southern ex-
reality of London-bridge.
The old man's board and air were as white as snow-
the former descending almost to his girdle; so were the
thick overhanging brows that shaded lis still piercing
eyes. His forehead was high, bald, and ploughed by inn-
miserable wrinkles. IIi countenance, despite its death-like
paleness, had a noble and majestic cast, and his figure,
though worn to the bone by as life of the severest story,
mud bent by the weight of years, must have been once lofty
and commanding. His dress consisted of n double and
those of sad-coloured cloth, over which he wore a loose
gown of black silk. HIs head was covered by a square
black cap, from beneath which his silver locks strayed over
his shoulders.
Known by the name of Doctor Lamb, and addicted to
alchemicnl and philosophical pursuits, this venerable person-
age was esteemed by the vulgar as little better than a
lizard. Strange tales were reported and believed of him.

ADRIfT.
Amongst others, it was said that he possessed a familiar,
because he chanced to employ a deformod, there-brained
dwarf, who assisted him in his operations, and whom he
appopriately enough denominated Flapdragon.
Doctor Lamb's gaze was fixed iutently upon the heavens,
and he seemed to be noting the position of the moon with
reference to some particular star.
After remaining in tis posture for a few minutes, he was
about to retire, when a loud crash arrested him, and he
turned to see whence it proceeded.
Immediately before him stood the Southward Gateway-
a square stone building, with a round, embattlod turret at
each corner, and a flat, leaden roof, planted with a forest
of poles, fifteen or sixteen feet high, garnished with human
heels. To his surprise, the doctor perceived that two of
these poles had just been overthrown by a tall man, who
was in the act of stripping than of their grisly burdens.
Having accomplished his object, the mysterious plunlerer
thrust his spoil into a leathern bag with which he was pro-
vided, tied its mouth, and was about to take his departure
by means of a rope-ladder attached to the battlements,
when his retreat was suddenly cut off by the gutekeeper,
armed with a chamber, and bearing a lantern, ho issued
from a door opening upon the leads.
The baffled marauder looked round, and remarking the
open window at which dOctor Limb was stationed, hurled
the sack and its contents through it. II then tried to
gain the ladder, but was intercepted by the gntckceper,
who dealt him n severe blow on the head with his chamber.

DR. LAMB.
The plunderer uttered a loud cry, and attempted to draw
his sword; but before he could do so, he received a thrust
in the side from his opponent. Ho then fell, and the gate-
keeper would hare repeated the blow, if the doctor had not
called to him to desist.
Do not kill him, good Already,'' he cried.  Th
attempt may not be so criminal as it appears. Doubtless,
the mntilatel remains which the poor wretch has attempted
to carry off, are those of his kindred, and horror at their
exposure must have led him to commit the offence.''
It may be, doctor,'' replied Already; `` and if so I shall
be sorry I have hurt him. But I am responsible for the
safe custody of these traitorous relics, and it is as much as
my own hand is worth to permit their removal.''
I know it,'' replied Doctor Lamb; ``and you are fully
justified in what you have done. It may throw some light
upon the matter, to know whose miserable remains ha
been disturbed.''
 They were the heads of two rank artists,'' replied
Bualdred,  who were deeapitatel on ower Hill, on Saint
Nicholas's day, three weeks ago, for considering against tha
queen.''
e But their names?'' demanded the doctor.  How
were they called 7''
 They were father and son,'' replied Already ;-: Sir
Simson Dare and Master Reginald Dare. Perchanea
they were known to your worship 7''

of emotion, that startled his hearer.  They were near

kinsmen of mineown. What is he lily who has made this
strange attempt ''
 Of a rerity, a fair youth,'' replies1 Daldrcd, holding
down the lantern.  Been grant I lay not wounded

as his tablets,'' ho added, taking a small book from his
trouble; `' these may gie the information you seek. You
were right in your conjecture, doctor. The name herein
inscribed is the same as that tone by the others-Mardol
Dare.''
I see it all,'' cried Lamb.  It was a pious and praise-
worthy deed. DUring the unfortunate youth to my dwelling,
Already, and you shall be well rewarded. Use despatch, I
pray you.''
As the gatekceper essayed to copy, the wounded man
groaned deeply, as if in great pain.
 Fling me the weapon with which you smote him,''
cried Doctor Lamb, in accents of commiseration, `'`and I
ill paint it with the power of sympathy. IIi anguish
ill be speedily abated.''
i know your worship can accomplish others,'' cried
aldred, throwing the chamber into the balcony. I ill
do my part as gently as I can.''
And as the alclemnist took up the weapon, and disappeared
through the window, the gatekceper lifted the wounded
man by the shoulders, and conveyed him down a narrow
winding staircase to a lower chamber. Though ho pro-
cried carefully, the sufferer was put to excraciating pain;
nnl when Already placed him in a wooden bench, and held

a lamp towards him, he perceived that his features were
darkened and distorted.
I fear it's all over with him,'' murmured the gatekeeper;
i hall hae a dead body to take to Doctor Lamb. It
would be a charity to knock him on the head, rather than
let him suffer thus. The doctor passes for a cunning ma,
but if he can cure this poor youth without seeing him, by the
help of his sympathetic content, I shall begin to believe,
that some folks touch, that he has relations with the
devil.'
While Already was rnminating in this manner, a sudden
and extraordinary change took place in the suflerer. As
if by magic, the contraction of the muscles subsided; the
features assumed n wholesome hue, and the rcspiration was
no longer laborious. Already stared as if a miracle had
been wrought.
Now that the countenance of the youth had regained its
original expression, the gatekeeper could not help being
struck hy its extreme beauty. The face was a perfect
oak, with regular and delicate features. A short silken
moustache covered the upper lip, which was short and
paul, and a pointed bear determined the chin. The hair
was black, glossy, and cut short, so as to disclose a highly
intellectual expanse of brow.
The youth's figure was slight, but atmirably proportioned.
His attire consisted of a black satin double, lashed with
white, hose of black silk, and a sort velvet mantle. His
eyes were still closed, and it was difficult to say what effect
they might give to the face when they lighted it no; but
AU10L.
notwithstanding its beauty, it was impossible not to admit
that a strange, sinister, and almost demoniacal expression
pervaded the countenance.
All at once, and with as much suddenness as his cure
had been effected, the young man started, uttering a
piercing try, and placed his hand to his side.
City1' he cried, fixing his blazing eyes on the gate-
keeper, `` why do you torture me thus? Finish me at once
-Oh'
And overcome by anguish, he sank back again.
I have not touched you, sir,'' replied Already. e1
brought you here to succour you. You will be easier anon.
Doctor Limb must have wiped the gallery,'' he added to
himself.
Another sudden change. The pain led from the sun-
fever's countenance, and he became easy as before.
 What had you done to me1'' he asked, with a look of
gratitude; ` to torture of my wound has suddenly ceased,
and I feel as if a balm had been dropped into it. Let me
remain in this state if you have any pity-or despatch me,
for my late agony was almost insupportable,''
 You are cared for by one who has greater skill than
any chirurgeon in London,'' replied Hundred.  If I can
manage to transport you to his lodgings, he will speedily
heal your wounds.''
i Do not delay, then,'' replies Ariol, faintly;  for
though I am free from pain, I feel that my life is ebbing
fast away.''
e Press this handkerchief to your side, and lean on to,''
DO. LAID.
said Mildred. Doctor Lamb's dwelling is but a step from
the gateway-in fact, the first house on the bridge. By
the way, the doctor declares he is your kinsman,''
 It is the first I ever heard of him,' replied Mardol,
faintly; "but take me to him quickly, or it will be too
late''
In another moment they were at the doctor's door.
Already tapped against it, and the summons was instantly
answered by a diminutive personage, clad in a jerkin of
coarse grey serge, and having a leathern apron tied round
his waist. This was Flapdragon.
Blear-eyed, smoke- begrimel, lantern-saved, the poor
dwarf seemed as if his whole life had been spent over the
furnace. And so, in fact, it had been. He had become
little better than a pair of human fellows. In his hand he
held the chamber with which Dauris had been wounded.
 So you have been playing the lcech, Flapdragon, eh7''
cried Mildred.
Ay, marry lark I,'' replied the dwarf, with a wild grin,
nd displaying na foolish set of teeth. ' My master ordered
me to smear the chamber with the sympathetic oiutment. I
obeyed him; rubbed the steel point, first on one side, then
on the other; next wiped it; and then smearedl it again.''
 Whereby you put the patient to exquisite pain,'' re-
plied Already; ` but help me to transport him to the la-
boratory.''
i know not if the doctor will care to be disturbed,'' said
Flapdragon.  Ho is busily engaged on a grand operation.''
 I will take the risk on myself,'' said Mildred. Tha

Thus urged, the dwarf laid down the chamber, and to-

ill repay thee for the trouble. I am busy now.''
 These relics, doctor,'' cried the gatekeeer, glancing at
the bag, which was lying on the ground, and from which a
bald head protruded-I ought to take them back with
me.''
 NEed them not-they will be safe in my keeping,''
cried Doctor Lamb, impatiently; `` to-morrow-to-morrow.''
Casting a furtive glance round the laboratory, and shrug-
going his slonllers, Barely departed; and FInpdragon
lang bathed the sufferer's temples with the direction, in
obedience to his master's injunctions, turned to inquire
what he should do next.
 Degonel'' cried the doctor, so fioreoel that the dwarf
darted out of the room, clapping the door after him.
Doctor Lamb then applied himself to his task with re-
never ardour, and in a few seconds became wholly since-
sible of the presence of a stranger.
n. AD.

Revived by the stimulant, Mardol presently opened his
eyes, and gazing round the room, thought he must be
dreaming, so strange and fantastical did all appear. The
floor was covered with the implements used by the adept-
bolt-heads, crucibles, cucnrbites, and retorts, scattered about
without any attempt at arrangement. In one corner was a
large terrestrial sphere; near it was an astrolabe; and near
that a heap of disused glass essels. On the other side, lay
s black, mysterious-looking book, fastened with brazen
clasps. Around it, were as am's horn, a pair of forceps, a
roll of parchment, a pestle and mortar, and a large plato of
copper, green with the mysterious symbols of the Disdain
table. Near this was the leathern bag containing the two
decapitated heads, one of which had burst forth. On a
table, at the farther end of the room, stood n large open
volume, with parchment leaves, covered with cabalistical
characters, referring to the names of spirits. Near it were
two parchment scrolls, written in letters, respectively deny-
painted by the Chaplain ages, '` the Malachim,'' and ` the
Passing of the River.'' One of these scrolls was kept in
its place by a skull. An ancient and grotesque-looking
brass lamp, with two snake-healed burners, lighted th
room. From the ceiling depended a huge scaly sea-monster,
with outspreal find, open jaws, garnishel with tremendous
teeth, and great goggling eyes. Near it hung a celestial
sphere. The chimney-piece, which was curiously cared,
and projected far into the room, was laden with various im-
elements of Hermetie science. Above it were hung dried
bats and flutter-mice, interspersed with the sills of birds

and apes. Attached to the chimney-piece was a horary,
sculptured in stone, near which hung a large stir-fish. Tea
fireplace was occupied by the furnace, on which, as has been
stated, was placed an alembic, communicating by means of
a long serpentine pipe with a receier. Within the room
were two skeletons, one of which, placed behind a curtain
in the deep embrasure of the window, where its polished
bones glistened in the white moonlight, had a horrible
effect. The other enjoyed more comfortable quarters near
the chimney, its leshless feet dangling down in the smoke
arising from the furnace.
Doctor Lamb, meanwhile, steadily pursued his task,
though he ever and anon paused, to fling certain roots and
drugs upon the charcoal. As he did this, various-coloured
flames broke forth-now blue, now green, now blood-red.
Tiuged by these fires, the different objects in the chamber
seemed to take other forms, and to become instinct with
animation. The gourd-shaped cucnurbites were transformed
into great bloated tones bursting with venom; the long-
necked bolt-head became monstrous serpents; the worm-
like pipes turned into adders; the alembics looked like
plumed helmets; the characters on the Musical table, and
those on the parchment, seemed traced in fire, and to be
over changing; the sa-monster bellowed and roared, and,
flapping his fine, tried to burst from his look; the she-
leans ragged their was, and raised their fleshless fingers
in mockery, while blue lights burnt in their eyeless sockets;
the fellows became a prodigious bat fanning the fire with

its wings; and the old alchemist assumed the appearance of
the arch-fiend presiding over a witches' sabbath.
Mardol's brain reeled, and he pressed his hand to his
eyes, to exclude these phantasms from his sight. But
even thus they pursued him; and he imagined he could
hear the infernal riot going on around him.
Suddenly, he was roused by a loud joyful cry, and, un-
covering his eyes, he beheld Doctor Lamb pouring the con-
tecnts of the matters-a bright, transparent liquid-into a
small half. Having carefully secured the bottle with a
glass stopped, the old man held it towards the light, and
gazed at it with rapture.
`At length,'' he exclaimed aloud-'` at length, the great
work is achieed. With the birth of the century now ex-
piring I first saw light, and the draught I hold in my hand
shall enable me to see the opening of centuries and can-
tries to come. Composed of the lunar stones, the solar
stones, and the mercurial stones-prepared according to
the instructions of the Rabbit Ben Lucca,-namely, by the
separation of the pure from the impure, the volatilisation
of the fixed, and the fixing of the olatile; this elixir shall
renew my youth, like that of the eagle, and give me length
of days greater than any patriarch ever enjoyed.''
While thus speaking, he held up the sparkling liquid,
and gazed at it like a Persian worshipping the sun.
 To live for her1'' he cried, after a pause-`` to escape
the jaws of death just when they are opening to devour
me 1-to be free from all accidents 1-'tis a glorious

thought1 It1 I bethink me, the rabbit said there was
one peril against which the elixir could not guard me-one
vulnerable point, by which, like the heel of Achilles, death
might reach me1 What is i 1-where can it lie7''
And he relapsed into deep thought.
 THis uncertainty will poison all my happiness,'' he
continued; ` I shall lie in constant dread, as of an evil-
sible enemy. But no matter Perpetual life l-perpetual
youth 1-what more need be desired 7''
 What more, indeed 1'' cried Mardol.
Ha1'' exclaimed the doctor, suddenly recollecting the
wounded man, and concealing the child beneath his gon.
e Your caution is vain, doctor,'' said Mardol.  I have
heard what you have uttered. You fancy you have disco-
vexed the olixir it.''
e Fancy I have discovered it1' cried Doctor Lamb.
 The matter is past all doubt. I am the possessor of the
wondrous secret, which the greatest plilosophers of all
ages hae sought to discover--the miraculous preserutive
of the body against delay.''
 The man who brought me hither told me you were my
kiusman,'' said Mardol.  Is it so t''
 It is,'' relied the doctor, '` and you shall now learn the
conexion that subsists between us. Look at that ghastly
relic,'' he added, pointing to the head protruding from the
bag, " that was once my son fAshion. His son's head is
within the sack-your father's head-so that four genema-
tions are brought together.''
 Gracious Heaven'' exclaimed the young man, raising

himself on his elbow.  You, then, are my great-grand-
sire. My father supposed you had died in his infancy. An
old tale runs in the family that you were charged with so-
very, and fled to avoid the stake.''
e It is true that I fled, and took the name I bear at pre-
sent,'' replied the old man, ``but I need scarcely say that
the charge brought against me was false. I hae devoted
myself to abstrusest science; hae held commune with the
stars; and have crested the most hidden secrets from
Nature-but that is all. To crimes alone have stained
my soul, but both, I trust, had been expiate by re-
penance.''
 Were they deeds of good'' asked Mardol.
One was so,'' replied Dare, with a shudder. 'It was
a cowardly and trcacherous deed, aggravated by the basest
ingratitule. Listen, and you shall hear low it chanced.
A Roman rabbit, named Ben Luccn, skilled in Hermetic
science, came to this city. His fame reached me, and I
sought him out, offering myself as his disciple. For
months, I remained with him in his laboratory-working
at the figure, and poring over mystic lore. One night, he
showed me that volume, and, pointing to a page within it,
said:  Those characters contain the secret of connecting
the elixir of Life. I will now explain them to you, and
afterwards we will proceed to the operation.' With this,
he unfolded the master; but he bade e observe, that the
menstrunm was defective on one point. Wherefore, he said,
`there will ,still be peril from some hidden case.' Oh,
with what readiness I drank in his words1 How lI gazed

at the mystic characters, as he explained there import
What visions floated before me of perpetual youth and one
joymcnt. At that moment a demon whispered in my ear,
-- This secret must be thine own. No one else must
possess it. 
 HIs1'' exclaimed Mardol, starting.
 The evil thought was no sooner conceived than acted
upon,'' pursued Dare. ` Instantly drawing my onward,
I plunged it to the rabbit's cart. Out mark that followed.
IIi blood fell upon the book, and obliternted the church-
tears; nor could I by any effort of memory recall the cow-
position of the elixir.''
 When did you regain the secret 2'' asked Mardol,
curiously.
 To-night,'' replied Day-`` within this hour. or
nigh fifty years after that fatal night I has been making
fruitless experiments. A film of blood has obscured my
mental sight. I have proceeded by calcitration, solution,
putrefaction-hae produced the oils which will fix crudo
mucrcuiry, and convert all bodies into sol and lena; but I
have over failed in tormenting the stone into the true elixir.
1-night, it came into my head to wash the blood-stained
y:c containing the secret with a subtle liquid. I did so;
up loubting the efficacy of the experiment, left it to work,
hill I went forth to breathe the air at my window. My
eyes were cast upwards, and I was struck with the malig-
want aspect of my star. How to reconcile this with the
good fortune which has just befallen me, I know not-but
so it was. At this juncture, your rash, but pious attempt

occurred. Having discovered our relationship, and enjoined
the gatekeeper to bring you hither, I returned to my old
laboratory. On glancing towards the mystic volume, what
was my surprise to see the page free from blood 1'
Mardol uttered a slight exclamation, and gazed at the
book with superstitious awe.
 THe sight was so surprising, that I dropped the sack I
had brought with me,'' pursued Dare.  Fearful of again
losing the secret, I served myself to the task, and placing
fuel on the fire, dismissed my attendant with brief injury-
tions relative to you. I then set to work. HOw I have
succeeded, you perceive. I hold in my hand to treasure
I have so long sought-so eagerly coveted. THe whole
world'a wealth should not purchase it from me.''
Mardol gazed earnestly at his aged relative, but he said
nothing.
t In a few moments I shall be as full of rigour and a-
levity as yourself,'' continued Dare. s We shall be no
longer the great-grandsire and his descendant, but friends
--companions-equal,-equal in age, strength, activity,
beauty, fortune-for youth is fortune-hal ha1 Methinks
I am already young again l''
 You spoke of two crimes with which your ceonscicnee
was burdened,'' remarked Mardol.  You have mentioned
]but one.''
 The other was not so foul as that I have described,''
]replied Day, in an altered tone, `` inasmuch as it was in-
intentional, and oeeasioned by no base motive. My wife,
your ancestress, was a most lovely woman, and so passion-

lately was I enamoured of her, that I tried by every art to
heighten and preserve her beauty. I fed her upon the flush
of capons, nourished with vipers; caused her to steep her
lonely limbs in baths distilled from roses and violets; and

parcel a draught from poisons-yes, poisons-the effect of
which I imagined would be wondrous. She drank it, and
expired horribly disfigured. Conceive my despair at be-
holding the fair image of my idolatry destroyed-offered
by my hand. In my frenzy I should have laid violent
hands upon myself, if I had not been restrained. Love
may again rule my heart-beauty may again dazzle my
eyes, but I shall never more feel the passion I entertained
for my lost mice-never more behold charms equal to
hers''
And he pressed his hand to his face.
 The mistake you then committed should sere as a
warning,'' said Mardol. ee What if it be poison you have
now connected? Try a few drops of it on some animal.''
e No-no; it is the true elixir,'' replied Dare. Not a
drop must be wasted. You will witness its effect anon.
Like the snake, I shall cast my slough, and come forth
younger than I was at twenty.''
MEantime, I bescech you to render me some assistance,''
groaned Mardol,  or, while you are preparing for immor-
quality, I shall expire before your eyes.''
 Be not afraid,'' replied Dare; `you shall take no
harm. I will care for you presently; and I understand

e Not for worlds,'' rejoined Dare, hugging the while to
his breast.  No; I will be young again-rich-happy.
I will go forth into the world-I will bask in the smiles of
beauty-I will feast, reel, sing-life shall be one perpetual
round of enjoyment. Now for the trial-hal'' and, as he
raised the potion towards his lips, a sudden pang shot
across his heart. e WHat is this 2'' he cried, staggering.

vainly endeavouring to raise lis palsied arm,-``perish with

And he sank backwards, and would have fallen to the
ground if he had not caught at the terrestrial sphere for
support.

unutterable anguish on his relative.

great effort, he raised himself, and staggered towards the
old man.

snatching the potion; `` no-no.''
And, supporting himself against the furnace, he placed
the while to his lips, and eagerly drained its contents.
THe old man seemed paralysed by the action, but kept
his eye fixed upon the youth till he had drained the telier
to the last drop. He then uttered a piercing cry, threw up
his arms, and fell heavily backwards.
Dead-dead
FLashes of light passed before Mardol's eyes, and strange
noises smote his ears. For a moment he was bewildered as
with wine, and laughed and sang discordantly like a mad-
man. Every object reeled and danced around him. The
glass vessels and jars flashed their little sides together,
yet remained uninjured; the furnace breathed forth flames
and emphatic vapours; the spiral worm of the alembic be-
came red hot, and seemed filled with molten lend; the pipe
of the bolt-head ran blood; the sphere of the earth rolled
along the floor, and rebounded from the wall as if impelled
by a giant hand; the skeletons grinned and gibbered; so
did the death's-head on the table; so did the sculls against
the chimney; the monstrous sea-fish reached forth fire and
smoke; the bald decapitated head opened its eyes, and

fixed them, with a stony glare, on the young man; while
the dead alchemist shook his hand menacingly at him.
Unable to bear these accumulated horrors, Mardol be-
came, for a short space, insensible. On recovering, all was
till. The lights within the lamp had expired; but the
bright moonlight, streaming through the window, fell upon
the rigid features of the unfortunate alchemist, and on the
cabalistic characters of the open volume beside him.
Eager to test the effect of the elixir, Mardol put his
hand to his side. All traces of the wound were gone; nor
did he experience the slightest pain in any other part of his
body. On the contrary, he seemed endowed with prefer-
natural strength. His breast dilated with rapture, and he
longed to expand his joy in active motion.
Striding over the body of his aged relative, he threw
open the window. As he did so, joyous peals burst from
surrounding churches, announcing the arrival of the new
year.
While listening to this clamour, Mardol gazed at the po-
clouds and picturesque city stretched out before him, and
bathed in the moonlight.
A hundred years hence,'' he thought, `` and scarcely one
soul of the thousands within those houses will he living, save
myself. A hundred years after that, and their children's
children will be gone to the grave. But I shall live on-
shall lie through all changes-all customs-all time.
What relations I shall then had to make, if I should
dare to disclose them l''
As he ruminated this, the skeleton hanging near him]
was swayed by the wind, and its bony fingers me in con-
tact with his cheek. A dread idea was suggested by the
e There is one peril to be avoided,'' he thought;`` oF]
an l-what is it Phaw1 I iLl think no more of it.]
It may never arise. I will be gone. This place fever ma.'']
With this, he left the labortory, and hastily descending]
the stir, at the foot of which he found Flaprgen, used
as the rst-his.
T dID COME T TIS rEALLY-HAD.

ArE one night, in the spring of 1880, two men issued
.from a low, obsenrely-situated public-house, near Iiillbank,
and shaped their course apparently in the direction of
Vauxhall-bridge. Avoiding the footpath near the river,
they moved stealthily along the farther side of the road,
where the open ground offered them au easy means of flight,
in case such a course should be found expedient. So far
as it could he disccrnol by the glimpses of the moon, which
occasionally shone forth from a rank of head clouds, the
appearance of these personages was not much in their
four. HAggard features, stamped deeply with the cha-
rafters of crime and , debauehery; fierce, restless eyes;
beards of several days' growth; wild, unkempt heads of
hair, formed their chief personal charaeteristics; while
sordid and ragged clothes; shoes without soles; and old
hats without crown, -.hesitated the sum of their apparel,
ARIOL.
One of them was tall and gaunt, with large hands and
feet; but despite his meagreness, he evidently possessed
great strength: the other was considerably shorter, but
broad-shouldered, bow-legged, long-armed, and altogether
a most formidable ruffian. This fellow had high cheek-
bones, a long aquiline nose, and a coarse mouth and chin,
in which the animal greatly predominated. He had
stubby red beard, with sandy hair, white brows and eye-
lashes. The countenance of the other was dark and re-
impulse, and covered with clothes, the result of habitual
intemperance. His eyes had s leering and malignant look.
A. handkerchief spotted with blood, and tied across his
brow, contrasted strongly with his matted black hair, and
incensed his natural appearance of ferocity. The shorter
rffian carried a mallet upon his shoulder, and his come-
passion concealed something beneath the breast of his cost,
which afterwards proved to be a dark lantern.
Not a word passed between them; but keeping a vigilant
look-out, they trudged on with quick, shambling steps. A
few sounds arose from the banks of the river, and there was
no and then a plash in the water, or a distant cry, be-
opening some passing craft; but generally all was pro-
fondly still. The quaint, Dutch-looking structures on the
opposite bank, the line of coal-barges and lighter bored
to the strand, the great timber-yards and coal-yards, the
brewhouses, gasworks, and waterworks, could only to him-
perfectly discerned; but the moonlight fell clear upon the
ancient towers of Lament Palace, and on the neighbouring
chrh. The same glimmer also ran like a silver bell

across the stream, and revealed the great, stern, fortress-
lIke pile of the Penitentiary-perhaps the most dismal-
looking structure in the whole metropolis. The world of
habitations beyond this melancholy prison were buried in
darkness. The two men, however, thought nothing of these
things, and saw nothing of them; but, on arriving within
a couple of hundred yards of the bridge, suddenly, as if by
previous concert, quitted the road, and, leaping a rail, ran
across a field, and plunged into a hollow formed by a dried
pit, where they came to a momentary hualt.

 Why, you can't expect me to answer for another as I

heard him say, as plainly as 'm a-speaking' to you,- TIll

 And that was one o'clock ?'' said the Scandal.
 Thereabouts,'' replied the other.
And who did he say that to'' demanded to Scandal.
To hisself, I s'pose,'' answered the Tinker;  for, as i
told you afore, I could see no one with him.''
 Do you think he's one of our expression 7'' inquired
the Scandal.

right mind to come to such a ken as that, and go on as you

As to that I can't say,'' replied the Tinker; `` and it
don't much matter, as far as ve're constance.''
Devil a bit,'' rejoined the Scandal, ``except-on'as
sure it worn't a sperrit, Tinker. Give heard say that this
crib is haunted, and though I don't fear no lion' man, a
ghost's a different sort of customer.''
 Tell, you'll find our smell arsl flesh and blood, you may
depend upon it,'' replied the Tinker. " So come along, and
don't let's to frightenin' ourselves with would vimen's tales.''
With this they emerged from the pit, crossed the lower
part of the field, and entered a narrow thoroughfare, skirted
by a few detached houses, which brought them into the
Vauxhall-bridge-road.
Here they kept on the side of the street most in shadow,
and crossed or whether they came to a lamp. By-and-
by, two watclmen were seen dancing from Belvoir-terrace,
and, as the guardians of the night drew near, the ruflians
crept into an alley to let tlc pass. As soon as the coast
was clear, they ventured forth, and quickening their once,
came to a row of deserted and dilapidated houses. Tis
was their destination.
The range of flirtation in question, more than a dozen
in number, were, in all probability, what is ulgarly called
`in Chance,'' and shared the fate of most property simi-
only circumstanced. They were in a sad ruinous state-an-
roofed, without windows and floors. The bare walls were
lone left standing, and these were in a very tumble-down

condition. These neglected dwellings served as receptacles
for old iron, blocks of stone and wood, and other ponderous
matters. The aspect of the whole place was so dismal and
suspicious, that it was generally aided by passengers after
nightfall.
Bkulking along the blank and dreary walls, the Tinker,
who was now a little in advance, stopped before a door, and
pushing it open, entered the dwelling. His companion
followed him.
The extraordinary and incongruous assemblage of objects
which met the gaze of the Scandal, coupled with the de-
seated appearance of the place, produced an effect upon his
hardy but superstitious nature.
Looking round, he beheld huge mill-stones, enormous
water-wheels, boilers of steam-engines, iron vatse, eylinders,
cranes, iron lumps of the strangest fashion, a gigantic pair
of wooden scales, old iron safe, old boilers, old gas-pipes,
old water-pipes, cracked old bells, old birdcsges, old plates
of iron, old valleys, ropes, and rusty chains, huddled and
heaped together in the most fantastic disorder. In the
.
midst of the chaotic mass frowned the bearded and colossal
head of Neptune, which had once decorated the forecast of
a man-of-war. Above it, on a sort of framework, lay the
the nose of the latter being partly demolished, and the eyes
knocked in. Able these, three garden divrinities laid their
heads amieably together. On the left stood a tall Grecian
warrior, minns the head and right hand. The whole was
surmounted by an immense entilator, stuck on the end of
ARIeL.
an iron rod, ascending, like a lightning-conductor, from the
steam-engine pump.
Seen by the transient light of the moon, the various objects
above enumerated produced a strange effect upon the be-
holler's imagination. There was a mixture of the grotesque
and terrible about them. Nor was the building itself de-
rid of a certain influence upon his mind. The ragged
brickwork, overgrown with weeds, took with him the sea
glance of a human face, and seemed to keep a wary eye on
what was going forward below.
A means of crossing from one side of the building to the
other, without descending into the vault beneath, was a-
forded by a couple of plsnks; though as the wall on the
farther side was some feet higher than that near at hand,
and the planks were considerably bent, the passage appeared
hazardous.
Glancing round for a moment, the Tinker leaped into
the cellar, and, unpausing his lantern, showed a sort of
hiding-place, between a bulk of timber and a colour, to
which he invited his companion.
The Scandal jumped down.
The ale I drank at the  TO Fighting Cocks' has made
me feel draws, Tinker,'' he remarked, stretching himself on
the bulk;  Il1 just take a sooner. Make me up if I snore
-or in our sperrit appears.''
The Tinker replied in the affirmative; and the other had
just become lost to consciousness, when he received a judge
in the side, and his companion whispered--t He's here I''

 here --- there t'' demanded the Scandal, in some]
trepidation.
 Look up, and you so him,'' replied the other.
Slightly altering his position, the Scandal caught sight
of a figure standing upon the planks above them. It was]
that of a young man. His hat was off, and his features, ex-
posed to the full radiance of the moon, looked denthly pale,
and though handsome, had a strange sinister expression.
He was tall, slight, and well-proportioned; and the general
cut of his attire, the tightly-bnttoned, single-breasted coat,
together with the moustache upon his lip, gave him
military sir.
 He seems a-valkin' in his sleep,'' muttered the Sand-
man.  He's a-speaking' to some von invisible.''
 Hush-hush'' whispered the other. ' Let's hear not]
he's a-saying',''
 Why have you brought me here1'' cried the young
man, in a voice so hollow that it thrilled his anditors.
s that is to be done 1'
 It makes my blood run cold to hear him,'' whispered]
the Scandal. e Not d'ye think he sees 2''
 Why do you not speak to me i'' cried the young man
-' why do you beckon me forward7 Well, I obey. I will
follow you.''
And he moved slowly across the plank.
 See, he's a-goin' through that door,'' cried the Tinker.
Let'a fuller him.''
e I don't half like it,'' replied tha Scandal, his teeth]

chattering with apprehension. We shall see summast as'll
take away our senses,''
Tut'' cried the Tinker; 'it's only a sleepy-alter.
Wot are you afeerd on 7''
With this he vaulted upon the planks, and peeping
cautiously one of the open door to which they led, saw the
object of his scrutiny enter the adjoining house through a
broken window.
Making a sign to the Scandal, who was close at his
heels, the Tinker crept forward on all for, and, on reach-
in the window, raised himself just sufficiently to command
the interior of the dwelling. Unfortunately for him, the
moon was at this moment obscured, and he could within-
guish nothing- except the dusky outline of the various
objects with which the place was filled, and which werenearly
of the same kind as those of the neighbouring habitation.
DIe listened intently, but not the slightest sound reached
his ears.
AFter some time spent in this way, he began to fear the
young man must have departed, when all at once a piercing
scream resounded through the dwelling. Some heavy
matter was dislodged, with a thundering crash, and foot-
steps were heard approaching the window.
HAstily retreating to their former hiding-place, th
Tinler and his companion had scarcely regained it, when
the young man again appeared on the plank. His doe-
measure had undergone a fearful change. He staggered
rather than walked, and his countenance was even paler

along the top of the broken wall towards the door.
Now, then, Scandal l'' cried the Tinker; ``now's your

The other nodded, and, grasping his mallet with a deadly
and determed purpose, sprang noiselessly upon the wall,
and overtook his intended victim just before he gained the
door.
Clearing a sound behind him, the young ran turned, and
only just became conscious of the presence of the Scandal,
when the mallet descended upon his local, and he fell
crushed and senseless to the ground.

union, ho instantly came up with the dark lantern;

clothes of the victim, '' A reader l-I hope it's well lined.

With this, he placed the wounded man's legs over his

own shoulders, and, aided by his comrade, was in the act of
heaving down the body, when the street-door suddenly
flew open, and a stout individual, attended by a couple of
watclmen, appeared at it.,
 There the villsins are'' shouted the new comer.  They
have been murderin' a gentleman. Seize 'em-seize 'em:'
And, as he spoke, he discharged a pistol, the ball from
which whistled past the ears of the Tinker.
Without waiting for another salute of the same kind,
which might possibly be nearer its mark, the ruffian kicked
the lantern into the vault, and sprang after th Scandal,
who had already disappeared.
Acquainted with the intricacies of the place, the Tinker
guided his companion through a hole into an adjoining
fault, whence they scaled a wall, got into the next house,
and passing through an open window, made good their
retreat, while the watchmen were vainly searching for them
under every bulk and piece of iron.
% Here, watclmen ?'' cried the stout individual, who had
acted as leader; ``never mind the villains just now, but
help me to convey this poor young gentleman to my house,
where proper assistance can be rendered him. He still
beathes; but he has received a terrible blow on the head.
I hope his skull ain't broken.'
It is to be hoped it ain't, Mr. Thorneyeroft,'' replied
the foremost watchman; `` but them was two desperate
characters, as ever I see, and capable of any hatterosity,''
e What a frightful scream I heard to be sure'' cried
MIr. Thorneycroft. "I was certain somethin' dreadful was

more fortunate you happened to be coming' up at the time.
But we mustn't stand chattering' here. Bring the poor
young gentleman along.''
Preceded by Mr. Thorneycroft, the watchmen carried the
wounded man across the road towards a small house, the
door of which was held open by a female servant, with a
candle in her hand. The poor oman uttered a cry of
horror as the body was brought in.
Do't be crying' out in that way, Perry,'' cried Mr.
Thorneyeroft, ``but go and get me some brandy. Here,
watchmen, lay the poor young gentleman down on the sofa
-there, gently, gently. And now, one of you run to
Wheeler-street, and fetch M. Well, the surgeon. Less
noise, Perry-less noise, or you'll wakon Miss Ebb, and
I wouldn't have her disturbed for the world.''
With this, he snatched the bottle of brandy from the
maid, filled a wine-glass with the spirit, and poured it down
the throat of the wounded man. A stifling sound followed,
and after struggling violently for respiration for a few
seconds, the patient opened his eyes.

TE BrokEn1 Who that has passed SAint Gives's, on

glimpse, through some narrow opening, of its squnlid habit-

any less cogent motive would hard abatod the nuisance,

airy street passes through the midst of its foul recesses, a

Entering a narrow street, guarded by posts and cross-

or over putrescent heaps of rubbish and oyster-shells, all the
repulsie and hideous features of the place were displayed
before you. There was something suvagely picturesque in
the aspect of the place, but its features were too loathsome
to be regarded with any other feeling than disgust. Tha
houses looked as sordid, and as thickly crusted with the
leprosy of vice, as their tenants. Horrible habitations
they were, in truth. MAny of them were without windows,
and where the frames were left, brown paper or tin supplied
the place of glass; some even wanted looks, and no effort
was made to conceal the squalor within. On the contrary,
it seemed to be intruded on observation. Miserable rooms,
almost destitute of furniture; floors and walls cuked with
dirt, or decked with coarse flaring prints; shameless and
abandoned-looking women; children without shoes and
stockings, and with scarcely a rag to their backs: these
were the chief objects that met the ice. Of men, few
were visible-the majority being out on business, it is to
be presumed; but where a solitary straggler was seen,
is sinister looks and mean attire were in perfect keeping
with the spot. So thickly inhabited were these wretched
dwellings, that cry chamber, from gurret to cellar,
shared with inmates. As to the cellars, they looked like
dismal caverns, which a wild best would shun. Clothes-
lines were hung from house to house, festooned with every
kind of garment. Out of the main street branched several
allcys and passages, all displaying the same degree of
misery, or, if possible, worse, and teeming with occupants.
Personal security, however, forbade any attempt to track

these labyrinths; but imagination, after the specimen
afforded, could easily picture them. It was impossible to
me a step without insult or annoyance. Every human
being seemed brutalised and degraded; and the women
appeared utterly lost to decency, and made the street ring
with their cries, their quarrels, and their imprecations. It
was a positive relief to escape from this hotbed of crime
to the world without, and breathe a purer atmosphere.
Such being the aspect of the Rookery in the daytime,
what must it have been when crowded with its denizens at
night1 Yet at such an hour it will not be necessary to
enter its penetralia.
After escaping on the ruined house in the Vauxhall-
road, the two ruffians shaped their course towards Saint
Gives's, running the greater part of the way, and reaching
the Roadway just as the church clock struck two. Darting
into a narrow alley, and heedless of any obstructions they
encountered in their path, they entered a somewhat wider
cross-street, which they pursued for a short distance, and
then struck into an entry, at the bottom of which was a
swing door that admitted them into a small court, where
they found a dwarfish person wrapped in a tattered watch-
man's great-coat, seated on a stool with a horn lantern in
his hand and a cutty in his mouth, the glow of which
lighted up his hard, withered features. This was the
deputy-porter of the lodging-house they were about to
enter, Addressing him by the name of Ol Part, the
ruffians passed on, and lifting the latch of another door,

entered a sort of kitchen, at the farther end of which
blazed a cheerful fire, with as large copper kettle boiling
upon it. On one side of the room was a deal table, round
which several men of sinister aspect and sordid attire were
collected, playing at cards. A smaller table of the same
material stood near the fire, and opposite it was a staircase
leading to the upper rooms. The place was dingy and
dirty in the extreme, the floors could not have been
scoured for years, and the walls were brimmed with filth.
In one corner, with his head resting on a heap of coals and
come, lay a boy almost as black as a chimney-sweep, fast
asleep. He was the waiter. The principal light was
afforded by a candle stuck against the wall, with as tin
reflected behind it. Before the fire, with his back turned
towards it, stood a notieeable individual, glad in a velveteen
jacket, with ivory bnttons, a striped waistcoat, drab knees,
s blood black silk neckcloth tied in a great bow, and a
pair of ancient Wellingtons asceending half-way up his
legs, which looked disproportionately thin when compared
with the upper part of his square, robustious, and some-
what pursy frame. His face was broad, jolly, and good-
humoured, with a bottle-shaped nose, fleshy lips, and light
grey eyes, glistening with cunning and roguery. His hair,
which dangled in long flakes over his ears and neck, was of
a dunnish red, ass were also his whiskers and beard. A
superannuated white castor, with a black hatband round it,
was locked knowingly on one side of his head, and gave
him a flash and sporting look. His particular opinion was

made manifest by the number of dogs he had about him.
A beautiful black-and-tan spaniel, of Charles the Second's
breed, popped its short by nose and long silken ears one
of each coat-pocket. A pang was thrust into his breast, and
he carried an exquisite Blenheim under either arm. At his
feet reposed an Isle of She terrier, and a partly-cropped
French poodle, of snow whiteness, with a red worsted
riband round his throat. This person, it need scarcely
be said, was a dog-fancies, or, in other words, a dealer in,
and a stenler of, dogs, as well as a prettier of all the tries
connected with that nefarions trade. His self-satisfied air
made it evident he thought himself a smart clever fellow,
-and adroit and finish he was, no doubt,--while his
droll, plausible, and rather winning manners, helped him
materially to impose upon his customers. His real name
was Taylor, but he was known among his companions by
the appellation of Ginger. On the entrance of the Scandal
and the Tinker, he nodded familinrly to them, and withal
sly look inquired-e Well, my 'artics-of luck 2'
 Oh, pretty smiling','' replied the Sandan, grnffly.
And seating himself at the table, near the fire, he kicked
up the lad, who was lying fast asleep on the cold, and bad
him fetch s pot of half-and-halt. The Tinker took a place
beside him, and they waited in silence the arrival of the
liquor, which, when it came, as disposed of at a couple of
walls; while Mr. Ginger, seeing they were engaged, sun-
tired towards the card-table, attended by his for-footed
companions.

see what fortune' has given us.''
So saying, he clasped the pocket-book, while the Tinker
bent over him in eager curiosity. But their search for
money was fruitless. Not a single bank-note was forth-
coming. There were several memorands and slips of paper,
a few cards, and an almanack for the year-that was all.
It was a great disappointment.

the book on the table with an oath. I wish I never un-

Tinker; '` summat may be made on it yet. Let's look over

While the sleepy youth bestirred himself to obey these
injunctions, the inner read over every memorandum in the
pocket-book, and then proceeded carefully to examine tha
different scraps of paper with which it was filled. Not con-
tent with one perusal, he looked them all over again, and

him some time or other.''

of his known' as, for the weary moment he looked round I

she don't come down at once the poor animal's throat ill

Well, she sent four pound, and I put up with it, pursued
Ginger; `` but about a month afterwards she loses her
favourite again, and, strange to say, I finds it. The same game
is played her again, and she comes down with another four
pound. But she takes care this time that I s'n't repeat
the trick; for no sooner does she obtain expression of her
favourite than she embarks in the steamer for France, in
the hope of keeping her dog safe there.''

the Scandal.
For' bless 'ee, yes,'' replied Ginger;  there as many

wi' them through them foreign steamers. There's scarcely
a steamer as leaves the port o' London but takes out a
cargo o' dogs. Ve sells 'em to the steward, stokers, and
sailors-cheap-and no questions asked. They goes to
Ostend, Antverp, Rotterdam, Chamber, and sometimes to

THE HAND AND THE CL0AK.
II.
A rose barking from Mr. Ginger's dogs, shortly
after the departure of the drowsy youth, announced the
approach of a grotesque-looking little personage, whose
shoulders barely reached to a level with the top of the
table. THis was Old Pair. The dwarf's ead was much
too large for his body, as is mostly the case with under-
sized persons, and was covered with a forest of rusty black
hair, protected by a strangely-shape seal-skin ear. His
hands and feet were equally disproportioned to his frame,
and his arms were so long that he could touch his ankles
while standing upright. His spine was crooked, and his
head appeared buried in his breast. The general character
of his face seemed to appealing to the middle period of life;
but a closer inspection enabled to beholden to detect in it
marks of extreme old age. The nose was broad and flat,
like that of an orphan-outang; the resemblance to which
animal was heightened by a very long upper lip, projecting
was, almost total absence of chin, and a retreating fore-
head. The little old man's complexion was dull and
swarthy, but his eyes were keen and sparkling.
His attire was as singular as his person. Having re-
gently served as double to a famous demon-dwarf at the
Barren Theatre, he had become possessed of a cast-off pair

of tawny tights, an elastic shirt of the same material and
complexion, to the arms of which little green bat-like wings
were attached, while a blood-red tune with vandykc points
was girl round his waist. In this strange apparel his
diminutire limbs were eneased, while additional warmth
was afforded by the great-coat already mentioned, the tails
of which swept the floor after him like a train.
HAving silenced his dogs with some difficulty, MIr. Ginger
burst into a roar of laughter, excited by the little old man's
grotesque appearance, in which he was joined by the finger;
but the Scandal never relaxed a muscle of his sullen
countenance.
Their ilarity, however, was suddenly cheeked by an
inquiry from te dwarf, in a shrill, odd tone,  Whether
they had sent for him only to laugh at him ?''
 Sartaiuly not, deputy,'' replied the Tinker. :Here,
lazy-bones, glasses o' rum-an'-water, all round,''
The drowsy youth bestirrel himself to execute the cow-
and. The spirit was brought; water was procured from
the boiling copper; and the Tinkor handed his guest a
smoking summer, accompanied with a polite request to
make himself comfortable.
Opposite the table at which the party were seated, it has
been said, as a staircase-old and erazy, and but imper-
gently protected by a broken hand-rail. Miiway up it stood
n door, equally dilapidatod, but security by a chain and
lock, of which Old Part, as deputy-chamberlain, kept the
key. Beyond this point, the staircase branched off on the
right, and a row of stout wooden banisters, ranged like the

feet of so many cattle, was visible from beneath. QUite-
lately, the staircase reached a small gallery, if such as
name can be applied to a narrow passage, communicating
with the bedrooms, the doors of which, as a matter of
needful precaution, were locked outside; and as the win-
down were grated, no one could leave his chamber without
the knowledge of the landlord or his representative. No
lights were allowed in the bedrooms, nor in the passage
adjoining them.
Conciliated by the Tinker's offering, Old Pair mounted
the staircase, and planting himself near the door, took off
his great-coat, and sat down upon it. His impish garb
being thus more fully displayed, he looked so nnearthly
and extraordinary that the dogs began to howl fearfully,

and Ginger had enough to do to quiet them.
Silence being at length restored, to Tinker, winking
slyly at his companions, opened the conversation.
I say, deputy,'' he observed, ' ve've bin having' a bit
of' a dispute vice you can settle for as.''
 WeIl, let's see,'' streaked the door.  What is it?"
 By, it's relative to your age,'' rejoined the Tinker.
 When was yo born 2''
 It's so long ago, I can't recollect,'' returned Old Part,
rather sulkily.

that's anything. Be seen it grow, and grow, till it has

I tell you, that I recollect this Rookery of ours-this foul
vagabond neighbourhood-an open country field, with
hedges round it, and trees. And a lovely spot it was

fenced round with pale, like a park, extended from Saint

timber,''

4 If I were to describe the changes that hae taken
place in London since I'e known it, I might go on talking
for a month,'' pursued Old Pair. The whole aspect of
the place is altered. The Thames itself is unlike th
Thaes of old. Its waters were once as clear and bright
above London-bridge as they are now at New or Rich-
mind; and its banks, from Whitefriars to Scotland-yard,
were edged with gardens. And then the thousand gay

 True,'' replied Old Part; '' and I, for one, am sorry
for it. Remembering, as I do, what the river used to be
when enlightened by gay raft and merry company, I can't
help wishing its waters less muddy, and those ugly coal-
barges, lighter, and steamers, away. London is a mighty
city, wonderful to behold and examine, inexhaustible in its
wealth and power; but in point of beauty, it is not to be
compared with the city of Queen Bessy's days. You should

and as to Lombard-street and Gracechurcl-street, with
their wealthy goldsmiths' shops-but I don't like to think

through streets, still called by the old names, but in other
respects wholly changed. Oh1 if you could but have a
glimpse of Old London, you would not be able to endure
the modern city. The very atmosphere was different from
that which we now breathe, charged with the smoke of
myriads of sea-could fires; and the old picturesque houses
had a charm about them, which the present habitations,
however commodious, altogether went.''

 Well then, to oblige you, Ll go through it again,''

into gold,'' rejoined Old Part, in a tone of slight contempt.
et But his chief aim was to produce the Elixir of Long Life.
Night and day ho worked at the operation;-night and
day I laboured with him, until at last we were both brought
to the verge of the grave in our search after immortality.
One night-I remember it well,-it was the last night of
the sixteenth century,-a young man, severely wounded,
was brought to my master'a dwelling on London-bridge. I

helped to convey him to the laboratory, where I left him
with the doctor, who was busy with his experiments. My
curiosity being aroused, I listened at the door, and though
I could not distinguish much that passed inside, I heard
sufficient to convince me that Doctor Lamb had made the
grand discovery, and succeeded in distilling the elixsir.
Having learnt this, I went down stairs, wondering what
would next ensue. Half an hour elapsed, and while the
bells were ringing in the new year joyfully, the young man
when I had assisted to carry up-stairs, and whom I sup-
posed at death's door, michael down as firmly as if nothing
had happened, passed by me, and disappeared, before I
could shake off my astonishment. I saw at once he had
drunk the elixir.''
Ah :-ah lI'' exclaimed the Tinker, with a knowing
glance at his companions, who returned it with gestures of
equal significance.
 As soon as he was gone,'' pursued the dwarf, I flew
to the laboratory, and there, extended on the floor, I found
the dead body of Dr. Lamb. I debated with myself what
to do-whether to pursue his murderer, for such I acconnted
the young man; but, on reflection, I thought the course
useless. I next looked round to see whether the precious
olixir was gone. On the table stood s child, from which
a strong spirituons odour exhaled; but it was empty. I
then turned my attention to a receier, connected by a
worm with an nlembic on the furnace. On examining it, I
found it contained a small quantity of a bright transparent
liquid, which, poured forth into a glass, emitted precisely

my

the same odour as the child. Persuaded this must be
the draught of immortality, I raised it to my lips; but
apprehension lest it might be poison stayed my hand.
Reassured, however, by the thought of the young man's
miraculous recovery, I quaffed the potion. It was as if I
had swallowed fire, and at first I thought all was over with
me. I shrieked out; but there was no one to heed my
cries, unless it were my dead master, and two or three
skeletons with which the walls hero garnished. And these,
in truth, did seem to hear me; for the dead corpse opened
its glassy orbs, and eyed me reproachfully; the skeletons
shook their fleslless arms and gibbered; and to various
strange objects with which the chamber was filled, seemed
to deride and menace me. The terror occasioned by these
fantasics, combined with the potency of the draught, took
away my senses. When I recovered, I found all tranquil.
Doctor Lamb was lying stark and stiff at my feet, with an
expression of reproach on his fixed countenance; and the
skeletons were hanging quietly in their places. Convinced
that I was proof against death, I went forth. But a curse
went with me From that day to this, I have lived, but it
has been in such poverty and distress, that I had better
far have died. besides, I am constantly haunted by visions
of my old master. He seems to hold converse with me-to
lead me into strange places.''

extreme surprise. I heard Doctor Lamb call him so.

self-applauding glance at his friends.

dwarf, in extreme agitation.

look; `` you see I does know some cur'out matters as well

dubiously.  There's no hurry.''
e No; he must decide at once,'' said the Tinker.  Jist
examine them papers,'' he added, handing the pocket-book
to OLd Part, `` and four us with your opinion on 'em.''.
The dwarf was about to unclasp the book committed to
his charge, when a hand was suddenly thrust through the
banisters of the upper part of the staircase, which, as has
been already stated, was divided from the lower by the
door. A piece of heart black drspery next descended like
a cloud, concealing all behind it except the hand, with
which the dwarf was suddenly seized by the nape of the
neck, lifted up in the air, and, notwithstanding his shrieks
and struggles, carried clean off.
. Great confusion attended his disappearance. The dogs
set up a prodigious bnrking, and flew to the rescue-one
of the largest of them passing her the body of the drowsy
waiter, who had sought his customary couch upon the coals,
and rousing him from his slumbers; while the Tinker,
uttering a fierce imprcecation, upset his chair in his haste
to catch hold of the dwarf's legs; but the latter was already
out of reach, and the next moment had vanished entirely,
 My eyes here's a pretty go'' cried Ginger, who,
with his back to the fire, had witnessed the occurrence
in open-mouthed astonishment. : By, curse it1 if the
venerable ain't a-taken the pocket-book with him1 It's

the pocket-book 1' cried the Tinker. And, dashing up the
stairs, he caught hold of the railing above, and swinging
himself up by a powerful effort, passed through an opening,
occasioned by the removal of one of the banisters.
Groping along the gallery, which was buried in profound
darkness, he shouted to the dwarf, but received no answer
to his vociferations; neither could he discover any one.
though he felt on either side of the passage with out-
stretched hands. The occupants of the different chambers,
alarmed by the noise, called out to know what was going
forward; but being locked in their rooms, they could render
no assistance.
While the Tinker was thus pursuing his search in the
dark, venting his rage and disappointment in the most
dreadful imprecations, the staircase door was opened by the
landlord, who had found the key in the great-coat left be-
hind by the dwarf. With the landlord came the Scandal
and Ginger, the latter of whom was attended by all lis
dogs, still barking furiously; while the rear of the party
was brought up by the drowsy waiter, now will awake with
fright, and carrying a candle.
But though eery nook and corner of the place was
visited-though the attics were searched, `and all the win-
down examined-not a trace of the dwarf could be disco-
vexed, nor any clue to his mysterious disappearance detected.
Astonishment and alarm sat on every countenance.
 WHat the devil can have become of him?'' cried tha
landlord, with a look of dismay.
Ay, that's the question1'' reioined the Tinkor. I

he loved, opening his own lacklustre orbs to their widest
extent.
 It's as strange affair,'' observed the landlord, gravely.
 It's certain that no one has entered the house wearing a
cloak such as you describe; nor could any of the lodges,
to my knowledge, get out of their rooms. It was Old
Pair's business, as you know, to lock 'em up carefully for
the night.''
 Well, all's over with him now,'' said the Tinker; ``and
with our affair, too, I'm afeard.''

TIE IRON-PIERCED's DAUGHTER. G3
I.
TE IrON-MEnCA's DAUGHTeR.
A wER had elapsed since Mardol Dare was conveyed to
the iron-merchant's dwelling, after the altar male upon
him by the ruffians in the ruined house; and though
almost recovered from the serious injuries he had reached,
he still remained the guest of his restored.
It was a bright spring morning, when a door lending to
to yard in front of the house opened, and a young girl,
bright and fresh as the morning's self, issued from it.
A loelier creature than Eba Thorneycroft cannot be
imagined. PIer figure was perfection-slight, tall, and
raishingly proportioned, with a slender waist, little limbs,
and fairy feet that would have made the fortune of an
opera-manner. Hoer features were almost angclic in ex-
passion, with an outline of the utmost delicacy and pre-
vision-not cold, classical regularity-but that softer and
incomparably more lovely mould peculiar to our own clime.
Ebbn's countenance was a type of Saxon beauty. Her
complexion was pure white, tinged with a slight bloom.
PIer eyes were of a serene summer blue, arched her by
brows some shades darker than the radiant tresses that
fell on either cheek, and were parted her a brow smoother
than alabaster. Her attire was simple, but tasteful, and

by its dark colour threw into relief the exceeding fairess
of her skin.
Ebba's first cart was to feed her favourite linnet, placed
in a sort over the door. Having next patted the head of a
huge bulldog who came out of his kennel to greet her. and
exchanged a few words with two men employed at a forge
in the inner part of the building on the right, she advanced
farther into the yard.
This part of the premises, being strewn wit ironwork of
every possible shape, presented a very singular appearance,
and may merit some description. There were heaps of
rusty iron chains lang together like fishermen's nets, old
iron area-guards, iron kitchen-fender, old grates, safe,
piles of old iron bowls, a large assortment of old iron pans
and dishes, a ditty of old ovens, settles without number,
sledge-hammer, nails, braziers, chimney-cowls, and smoke-
jaeks.
Stout upright posts, supporting cross-beams on the top,
were placed at intervals on either side of the yard, and
these were decorated, in the most artistic style, with rat-
traps, man-tops, iron lanterns, valleys, padlocks, chains,
rivers, strangers, iron rods, disused street lamp, dis-
mounted cannon and anchors. Attached to hooks in the
cross-beam nearest the house hung a row of old horse-
shoes, while from the centre depended a large rusty bell.
Near the dog's kennel was a tool-box, likewise garnished
with horse-shoes, and containing pincers, fills, members,
and other implements proper to the smith. beyond this

was an open doorway leading to the workshop, where the
two men before mentioned were busy nt the forge.
Though it was still early, the road was astir with pas-
singers, and many waggons and carts, laden with hay,
straw, and vegetables, were passing. Ebba, however, had
been solely drawn forth by the beauty of the morning, and
she stopped for a moment at the street gate, to breathe
the balmy air. As she inhaled the gentle breeze, and felt
the warm sunshine upon her cheek, her thoughts wandered
away into the green meadows in which she had strayed as
a child, and she longed to ramble amid them again. Per-
haps she scarcely desired a solitary stroll; but however this
might be, she was too much engrossed by the reverie to
notice a tall man, wrapped in a long black clock, who re-
garden her with the most fixed attention, as he passed on
the opposite side of the road.
Proceeding to a short distance, this personage crossed
over, and returned slowly towards the iron-merchant's
telling. Ebba then, for the first time, remarked him,
and was startled by his strange, sinister appearance. His
features were handsome, but so malignant and force in ex-
passion, that they inspired only aversion. A sardonic grin
curled his thin lips, and his short, crisply-curled hair, ran
black in hue, contrasted forcibly and disagreeably with his
caluaverous complexion. An attraction like that of the
snake seemed to reside in his dark blazing eyes, for Ebba
trembled like a bird beneath their influence, and could not
remote her gaze from them. A vague presentiment of

coming ill smote her, and she dreaded lest the mysterious

being before her might be connected in some inexplicable
On his part, the stranger was not insensible to the im-
passion he had produced, and suddenly halting, he kept
his eyes riveted on those of the girl, who, after remaining
spell-bound, as it were, for a few moments, precipitately re-
treated towards the house.
just as she reached the door, and was about to pass
through it, Mardol came forth. He was pale, as if from
recent suffering, and bore his left arm in a sting.
 You look agitated,'' ho said, noticing Ebba's easily-
ness. What has happened '
 Not much,'' she replied, a deep blush anything her
cheeks. `` But I have been somewhat alarmed by the person
near the gate,''
 Indeed?'' cried Mardol, darting forward. 4Where is
he? I see no one.''
2e Not a tall man, wrapped in a long black cloak f'' re-
joined Ebba, following him cautiously.
 HaD' died Mardol. : Has he been here 1'
 Then you know the person I allude to 1'' she rejoined.
e I know some one answering his description,'' he re-
plied, with a forced smile.
4 Once beheld, the man I mean is not to be forgotten,''
said Ebba. DIe has a countenance such as I never saw
before. If I could believe in the ` evil eye,' I should be
sure he possessed it.''
s Tis he, there can be no doubt,'' rejoined Mardol, in a
sombre tone.

 who and what is he, then 2'' demanded Ebba.
 He is a messenger of ill,'' replied Mardol, ` and I am
thankful he is gone.''
 Are you quite sure of it71'' he asked, glancing timor-
soul up and down the road. But the mysterious indi-
ideal could no longer be seen.
` And so, after exciting my curiosity in this manner, you
will not satisfy it2' she said.
e I cannot,'' rejoined Mardol, somewhat sternly.
t Nay, then, since you are so ungracious, I shall go and
prepare breakfast,'' she replied.  My father must be
down by this time.''
 Stay:'' cried Mardol, resting her, as she was about
to pass through the door.  I wish to have a word with
you.''
Ebba stopped, and the bloom suddenly forsook her
cheeks.
But Mardol seemed unable to proceed. Neither dared to
regard the other; and a profound silence readily between
them for a few moments.
 Ebba,'' said Angrily at length, 'I am about to leave
your father's house to-day.''
 hy so soon 7'' so exclaimed, looking up into his
face.  You are not entirely recovered yet.''
I dare not stay longer,'' he said.
 Dare not '' tried Ebba. And she again cast down her
eyes; but Mardol made no reply.
Fortunately the silence was broken by the clinging of the
smiths' hammer upon the anvil.

 If you must rally go,'' said Ebba, looking up, after
long pause, `` I hope we shall see you again7''
 MOst assuredly,'' replied Mardol.  I owe your worthy
father a deep debt of gratitude-a debt which, I fear, I
shall never be able to repay.''
 My father is more than repaid in saving your life,'' she
replied. ``I am sure he will be sorry to learn you are going
so soon.''
4 I have been here a week,'' said Mardol.  If I remained
longer, I might not be able to go at all,''
There was another pause, during which a stout old
fellow in the workshop quitted the anvil for a moment,
and, catching a glimpse of the young couple, muttered to
his helpmate:
 I say, New, To a-thinkin' our master'll soon have
a son-in-law. There's pretty plain signs on it at yonder
door,''
 So there be, John,'' replied New, peeping round. :He'a
a good-looking' young follow that. I wish to could hear
their discourse.''
e No, that ain't fair,'' replied John, raking some small
coal upon the fire, and working away at the fellows.
4 I would not for the world ask a disagreeable question,''
said Ebba, again raising her eyes, ``but since you are about
to quit us, I must confess I should like to know something
of your history.''

SAID.
 Forgive me if I decline to comply with your desire,''
replied Mardol.  You would not believe me, were I to re-
late my history. But this I may say, that it is stranger

and wilder than any you ever heard. The prisoner in his
cell is not restrained by more terrible fetters than those
which bind me to silence.'
Ebba gazed at him as if she feared his reasoning were
wandering.
 You think me mad,'' said Angrily; ` would I were so
But I shall never lose the clear perception of my woes.
Hear me, Ebba Fate has brought me into this house. I
have seen you, and experienced your gentle ministry; and
it is impossible, so circumstanced, to be blind to you
attractions. I have only been too sensible to them-but I
will not dell on that theme, nor run the risk of exciting a
passion which must destroy you. I will ask you to hate
me-to regard me as a monster whom you ought to shun
rather than as a being for whom you should entertain the
slightest sympathy.''
 You have some motive in saying this to me,'' cried the
terrified girl.
 My motive is to warn you,'' said Angrily. t If you
love me, you are lost-utterly lost''

She was so startled, that she could make no reply, but
burst into tears. Mardol took her hand, which she un-
resistingly yielded.
 A terrible fatality attaches to me, in which you must
have no share,'' he said, in a solemn tone.
 Would you had never come to my father's house t''
he exclaimed, in a voice of anguish.
 Is it, then, too late'' cried Mardol, despairingly.
4 It is-if to love you be fatal,'' she rcjoinel.

MARDOL.
e i' exclaimed Mardol, striking his forehead with his
clenched hand.  Real your words-Ebba-real them
-but no, once uttered-it is impossible. You are bound
to me for her. I must fulfil my destiny.''
At this juncture a low growl broke from the dog, and,
guided by the sound, the youthful couple beheld, standing
near the gate, the tall dark man in the black cloak. A
friends side sat upon his countenance.
e That is the man who frightened me'' cried Ebba.
 It is the person I supposed1' ejaculated Mardol. I
must speak to him. Leave me, Ebba. I will join you
presently.''
And as the girl, half sinking with apprehension, with-
drew, he danced quickly towards the intruder.
4 I have sought you for some days,'' said the tall man,
in a stern, commanding voice.  You have not kept your
appointment with me.''
 I could not,'' replied Mardol-'' no accident has be-
fallen me.''
4I know it,'' rejoined the other. t I am are you
were assailed by ruffians in the ruined house over the way.
But you are recovered now, and can go forth. You ought
to have communicated with me.''
 It was my intention to do so,'' said Angrily.
 Our meeting cannot be delayed much longer,'' pursued
the stranger. e I will give you three more days. On the
evening of the last day, at the hour of seven, I shall look
for you at the foot of the state in Hyde Park.''
ee I will be there,' replied Mardol.
THE MEETING NEAR THE STATUE. 71
 That girl must be the next victim,'' said the stranger,
with s grim smile.
 Peace 1'' thundered Mardol.
t Any, I need not remind you of the nature by which
you maintain your power,'' rejoined the stranger.  But I
will not trouble you further now.''
And, wrapping his cloak more closely round him, he is-
appeared.
4 Fate has once more involved me in its net'' cried
Mardol, bitterly. e But I will see Ebbs, whatever it may
cost me. I will see her no more,''
And instead of returning to the house, he hurried away
in the opposite direction of the stranger.
IT evening of the third day arrived, and Mardol entered
Hyde Park by Stanhope-gate. Glancing at his watch, and
finding it wanted nearly three-quarters of an hour of the
time appointed for his meeting with the mysterious stranger,
he struck across the Park, in the direction of the Serpentine
River. Apparently he was now perfectly recovered, for
his arm was without the support of the sting, and he
walked with great swiftness. But his countenance was
deathly pale, and his looks were so wild and disordered, that
the few persons he encountered shrank from him aghast
zz
VIOL.
A few minutes' rapid walking brought him t th
eastern extremity of the Serpentine, and dancing close
to the edge of the embankment, he gazed at the waters
beneath his feet.
I would plunge into them, if I could find repose,'' e
murmured.  But it would avail nothing. I should only
add to my sufferings. No; I must continue to endure the
weight of a life burdened by crime and remorse, till I can
find out the means of freeing myself from it. Once I
dreaded this unknown danger, but now I seek for it in
vain.''
The current of his thoughts were here interrupted by the
sudden appearance of a dark object on the surface of the
water, which he at first took to be a huge fish, with a pair
of green find springing from its back; but after watching
it more closely for a few moments, he became convinced
that it was a human being, tricked out in some masqnerade
attire, while the slight struggles which it male proved that
life was not entirely extinet.
Though, the moment before, he had contemplate self-
destruction, and had only been restrained from the attempt
by the certainty of failing in his purpose, instinct prompted
him to rescue the perishing creature before him. Without
hesitation, therefore, and without tarrying to digest himself
of his clothes, he dashed into the water, and striking out,
instantly reached the object of his quest, which still con-
tinued to float, and turning it over, for the face was down-
wards, he perceived it was an old man, of exceedingly small
size, habited in a pantomimic garb. II also remarked

that a rope was twisted round the neck of the unfortunate
being, making it evident that some violent attempt had
been made upon his life.
WIthout pausing for further investigation, he took firm
hold of the leathern wings of the dwarf, and with his risen-
aged hand propelled himself towards the shore, dragging
the other after him. The next instant he reached the bank,
clambered up the lo brickwork, and placed his burden in
safety.
The noise of the plunge had attracted attention, and
several persons now hurried to the spot. On coming up,
and finding Mardol bending over a water-sprite--for such,
at first sight, the dwarf appeared-they could not repress
their astonishment. Wholly insensible to the presence of
buzz:a::::
those around him, Mardol endeavoured to recall where he
lashed upon him, and he cried aloud,  Why, it is my poor
murdered grandfather's attendant, Flapdragonl But no
no l-he must be dead agesagol Yet the resemblance is
singularly striking'
Mardol's exelamations, coupled with his wild lemeanour,
surprised the bystanders, and they came to the conclusion
that he must be a travelling showman, who had attempted
to drown his dwarf-the grotesque, impish garb of the
latter conviction them that he had been exhibited at a
booth. They made signs, therefore, to each other not to
let Mardol escape, and one of them, raising the dwarf's
head on his knee, produced a flask, and poured some brandy
from it down his throat, while others chafed his hands
LLLLLLLLLLIL
ALL.
These efforts were attended with much speedily success
than might have been anticipated. After a struggle or two
for rcspiration the dwarf opened his eyes, and gazed at the
group around him.
It must be Flapdragon I'' exclaimed Mardol.
Ah 1 who calls me?'' cried the dwarf.
I1' rejoined Mardol.  Do you not recollect me2''
 To be sure'' exclaimed the dwarf, gazing at him fix-
idly; ``you are -'' and he stopped.
4 You have been thrown into the water, Master Flap-
dragon 7'' cried a bystander, noticing the cord round the
dwarf's throat.
I have,'' replied the little old man.
e By your goernor-that is, by this person 7'' cried
]another, laying hold of Mardol.
By him-no,'' said the dwarf; I have not seen that
gentleman for nearly three centuries.''
 Three centuries, my little patriareh 7'' said the man
who had given him the brandy.  That's a long time.
Think again.''
:It's perfectly true, nevertheless,'' replied the dwarf.
e His wits have been washed away by the water,'' said
the first speaker.  Gie him a drop more brandy.''
 Not a bit of it,'' rejoined the dwarf; `' my senses were
never clearer than at this moment. At last we have met,'
he continued, addressing Dauris, ``and I hope we shall not
]speedily part again. We hold life by the same tie.''
 How came you in the desperate condition in which I
found you 1'' demanded Mardol, evasively.

tI was thrown into the canal with a stone to my neck,
like a dog about to be drowned,'' replied the dwarf.  But,
as you are aware, Am not so easily disposed of,
Again the bystanders exchanged significant looks.
t: By whom was the attempt made 1'' inquired Mardol.
 I don't know the villain's name,'' rejoined the dwarf,
but he's a very tall, dark man, and is generally wrapped
in a long black cloak.''
 a l'' exclaimed Mardol. e When was it done
Some nights ago, I should fancy,'' replied the dwarf,
for HAve been a terrible long time under water. I have
only just managed to shake off the stone''
At this speech there was a titter of incredulity among
the bystanders.
You may laugh, but it's true' cried the dwarf,
angrily.
 Wo must speak of this anon,'' said Mardol. e WI
you coney him to the nearest tavern ?'' he added, placing
money in the hands of the man who held the dwarf in his
 writing, sir,'' replied the man. eVil take him to
the Life Guardsman, near the barracks, that'a the nearest
public.''
To join him there in an hour,'' replied Mardol, moving
away.
And as he disappeared, the man took up his little burden,
and bent his steps towards the barracks.
Utterly disregarding the dripping state of his habit-
meets, Mardol proceeded quickly to the place of rendezvous.

ARIOL.
Arrived there, he looked around, and not seeing any one
flung himself upon a bench at the foot of the gentle em-
hence on which the gigantic statue of Achilles is placed.
It was becoming rapidly dark, and heavy clouds, portend-
ing speedy rain, increased the gloom. Mardol's thoughts
were sombre as the weather and the hour, and he fell into
deep fit of abstraction, from which he was roused by hand
laid on his shoulder.
Receiving at the touch, he raised his eyes, and beheld the
stranger leaning over him, and gazing at him with a look
of diabolical exultation. The cloak was thrown partly
aside, so as to display the tall, gaunt figure of its wearer;
while the large collar of subtle fur with which it was deco-
rated stood out like the wings of a demon. The stranger's
hat was off, and his high broad forehead, white as marble,
was fully revealed.
Our meeting must be brief,'' he said. aRe you pre-
parcel to ful6l the compact7
 What do you require 2'' replied Mardol.

other;  the iron-merchant's daughter, Ebbn. She must

the stranger; '` she must be mine-or--''

fixing a withering glance upon him.  Bring her to me

And, eneloping himself in his cloak, he retreated behind
the statue, and was lost to view.
As he disappeared, a moaning wind arose, and heavy
rain descended. Still Arnold did not quit the bench.

It was about two o'clock, on a charming spring day, that
a stout middle-aged man, accompanied by a young person
of extraordinary beauty, took up his station in front of
Langham Church. Just as the clock struck the hour,
a young man issued at a quick pace from a cross-street,
and came upon the couple before he was aware of it. He
was evidently greatly embarrassed, and would have beaten
a retreat, but that was impossible. His embarrassment
was in some degree shared by the young lady; she blushed
deeply, but could not conceal her satisfaction at the en-
counter. The elder individual, who did not appear to
notice the confusion of either party, immediately extended
his hand to the young man, and exclaimed:

down her eyes.

 But you neglected to tell me how to acknowledge the gift.''
I could not give an address at the moment,'' said
Mardol.
 all, I am glad to find you had got the use of your
arm again,'' observed the iron-merchant; ` but I can't say
you looked so well as when you left us. You seem paler--
eh 7 what do you think, bba ?'
4 MI. Dare looks as if he were suffering from mental
anxiety rather than from bodily ailment,'' she replied,
timidly.
I am so,'' replied Mardol, regarding her fixedly. :A
very disastrous circumstance has happened to me. But
answer me one question: has the mysterious person in the
black clock troubled you again ?''
 What mysterious person 2'' demanded Mr. Thorney-
croft, opening his eyes.
 Never mind, father,'' replied Ebba.  I saw him last
night,'' she added o Mardol.  I was sitting in the back
room alone, wondering what had become of you, when I
heard as top against the window, which was partly open,
and, looking up, I beheld the tall stranger. It was nearly

dark, but the light of the fire revealed his malignant
countenance. I don't exaggerate, when I say his eyes
gleamed like those of a tiger. I was terribly frightened,
but something prevented me from crying out. After gazing
at me for a few moments, with a look that seemed to face-
name while it frightened me, he said-t You desire to see]
Mardol Dare. I have just quitted him. Go to Langham-
place to-morrow, and, as the clock strikes two, you will
behold him.' Without waiting for any reply on my part,
he disappeared.''
Ah, you never told me this, you little rogne l'' cried
MIr. Thorneycroft.  You persuaded me to come out with]
you, in the hope of meeting Mr. Dare; but you did not
say you were sure to find him. So you sent this must-
rions gentleman to her he 7'' he added to Burial.
 No, I did not,'' replied the other, gloomily.
 Indeed 1'' exclaimed the iron-merchant, with a puzzled
look.
 Oh, then I suppose he thought it might relief her
anxiety. However, since wo hare met, I hope you'll walk]
home and dine with us.''
Mardol was about to decline the invitation, but Ebba]
glanced at him entreatingly.
i have an engagement, but I will forego it,'' he said,
offering his arm to her.
And they walked along towards Oxford-street, while]
Mr. Thorneyeroft followed, a few paces behind them.
 This is very kind of you, Mr. Day,'' said Ebba.

I grievre to hear it,'' ho rejoined. I hoped you had
forgotten me.''
 I am sure you did not think so,'' she cried.
As she spoke, she felt a shudder pass through Mardol's
frame.
 What ails you'' she anxiously inquired.
 I would have shunned you, if I could, Ebbas,'' he re-
plied; `` but a fate, against which it is in to contnd, has
brought us together again.''
I am glad of it,'' she replied; '` because, her since our
Last interview, I have been reflecting on what you then said
to me, and am persuaded you are labouring under some
strange delusion, occasioned by your recent accident.''
 Be not deceived, Ebba,'' cried Mardol.  I am under
terrible influence. I need not remind you of the mysterious
individual who tapped at your window last night.''
 What of him?'' demanded Ebba, with a thrill of a-
prehension.
 He it is who control my destiny,'' replied Mardol.
 But what has he to do with me1'' asked Ebba.
 Much, much,'' he replied, with a perceptible shudder.
 You terrify me, Mardol,'' she rejoined.  TEll me what
you mean-in pity, tell me''
Before Mardol could reply, Mr. Thorneyeroft stepped for-
word, and turned the conversation into another channel.
Soon after this, they reached the Quadrant, and were
passing beneath the eastern colonnade, when Ebba's attend-
lion was attracted towards a man who was leading a couple
of dogs by a string, while he had others under his arm,

Charles the Second spaniel.
Allow me to present on with it'' said Mardol.
e You know I should value it, as coming from you,'' she
replied, blushing deeply; ` but I cannot accept it; so I
will not look at it again, for fear I should be tempted.''
The dog-fancies, however, noticing Ebba's admiration,
held forward the spaniel, and said,  Do jist look at the
pretty little greater, miss. It can't its equal for beauty.
Don't be afeerd on it, miss. It's as gentle as a limb.''
e Oh l you little darling I'' Ebba said, patting its sleek
head and long silken ears, while it fixed its large black
eyes upon her, as if entreating her to become its purchaser.
 Fairy seems to have taken quite a fancy to you, miss,''
observed Ginger; `` and she ain't i' the habit o' fallen' i
love at first sight. I don't wonder at it, though, for my
part. I should do just the same, if I was in her place.

Ebba, smiling.

Ginger; ``you should have her, and welcome. But I must

again patting the animal's head.
While this was passing, two men of very suspicions

reconnoitring Mardol.

give me fifteen pound, and the dog's your. I shall lose

Mardol, who had fallen into a fit of abstraction, here re-
marked;

I of a-saint', sir, the young lady shall have the dog
for fifteen pound, and a precious bargain it is,'' replied
Ginger.
e Well, then, I close with you. Here's the money,''
said Mardol, taking out his purse
 On no account, Mardol,'' cried Ebbs, quickly.  It's too

`A great deal too much, Mr. Dare,'' said Thorney-
croft.
'Mardol and Day l'' muttered Ginger. Can this be
the german ve're a-looking' for. Here's my two palms, I
wonder? Oh, it's all right 1'' he added, receiving a signal
from behind the pillar.  They'are on the look-out, I see.''
 Give the lady the dog, and take the money, man,'' said
Mardol, sharply.
 Beg pardon, sir,'' said Ginger, '`but hadn't I better
carry the dog home for the young lady7 It might meet
with some accident in the ay.''
'Accident l-stuff and nonsense'' cried Mr. Thorney-

 The bargain's concluded,'' said Ginger, delirering th
dog to Ebb, and taking the money from Mardol, which,
having counted, he thrust into his capacions breeches-

 How hall I thank you for this treasure, Mardol?'' ex-
claimed Ebba, in an ecstasy of delight.
4 By transferring to it all regard you may entertain for

 That is impossible,'' she answered.
 Well, I one we drive away at once,'' said Mr. Thorney-
heart. : Shallow jarve I'' he cried, railing a coach that
was passing; adding, as the vehicle stopped,  Now get in,
Ebbas. By this means we shall avoid being followed by
the rascal.''
By saying, he got into the coach. As Mardol was about
to follow him, he felt a slight touch on his arm, and,
turning, beheld a tall and very forbidding man by his side.
 Beg pardon, sir,'' said the fellow, touching his hat,

whose back was towards the Tinker.

as the coach drove away, he added to the Tinker, ' Not,

Mardol.
The Tinker's hands clutched the purse mechanically, but

he said.
And he followed his companions.
Left alone, Mardol groaned aloud, and covered his face
with his hands. When he looked up, he found the tall
man in the black clock standing beside him. A demoniac
smile played upon his features.

the VOice-Chancellor is doing; and you will own, on rising,
that you have never spent a five minutes more agreeably.

an assortment of busts moulded in wax, exhibiting the
triumphs of Mr. Trying's art; and, above these, are several
specimens of legal wigs. On the little counter behind the
window, amid large pots of command and bears'-crease, and
the irons and brushes in constant use by the barbed, are
other bustos, done to the life, and for ever glancing amiably
into the room, On the block is a judge's wig, which MIr.
Trying has just been dressing, and a little farther, on a
higher block, is that of a counsel. On either side of the
fireplace are portrait of Lord Eldon and For Lyndhurst.
some other portraits of pretty addresses are likewise to be
seen. Against the counter rests n board, displaying the
playbill of the evening; and near it is a large piece of
emblematical mockery, indicating that bears'-grease may
be had on the premises. Amongst Mr. Trying's lip stock
may b enumerated his favourite magpie, placed in wicker
cage in the window, which chatter incessantly, and knows
everything, its master avouches, ` as well as a Christian.''

ANiMAL.
And now as to Mr. Tuffnell INtrigue himself. He is very
tall and very thin, and holds himself so upright that ha
loses not an inch of his stature. His head is large and is
face long, with marked, if not very striking features, charged,
it must be admitted, with a very self-satisfied expression.
One cannot can the appellation of the Bearer of London
without talent; and it is the consciousness of this talent
that lends to MIr. Trying's features their apparently con-
ceited expression. A fringe of black whiskers adorns is
cheek and chin, and his black briskly hair is brushed back,
so as to exhibit the prodigious expanse of his forehead.
IIi eyebrows are elevated, as if in constant scorn.
The attire in which Mr. ridge is ordinarily seen, consists
of a black velvet waistcoat, and tight black continuations.
These are protected by a white apron tied round his waist,
with pockets to hold his scissors and combs; over all, ho
wears a short keen jacket, into the pockets of which his
hands are constantly thrust then not otherwise employed,
A black satin stoeke with a large bow encireles his throat,
nnl His shirt is fastened by black name studs. Such is
MI, Still Ragged, except the Barter of London.
At the time of is introduction to the reader, MIr. Bridge
had just advertised for an assistant, his present young man,
Rutherfrd Watts, being about to leave hi, and set up for
himself in Canterbury. It was about two o'clock, and Mr,
Bridge had just withdrawn into an inner room to take some
reflection, when, on returning, he found Watts occupied in
cutting the hair of a mill-aged, sour-looking gentleman,
he was seated afore the fire. MIr. Trying bored to the

conversation with him, but no notice being taken of his
ndvances, ho went and talked to lis magpie.
WHile he was chattering to it, the ingenious bird
screamed forth : : Pretty lear 1-pretty dear '
Oh I what that Who is it?' cried 'ridge.
 Pretty dear.-pretty let' reiterated the magic.
Upon this, Trying looked around, and saw a very
singular little man enter the shop. He had somewhat the
appearance of a groom, being clothed in a long grey coat,
drab knees, and small top-boots. DIe had a large and
remarkably projecting month, like that of a barton, and a
great shook end of black hair.
 Bitter dear l-pretty dear I'' seemed the magpie.
I see nothing pretty about him,'' thought MIr. Trying.
44 What a strange little fellow. It would puzzle the Lord
Chancellor himself to say what his age might be,''
The little man task off his hat, and making n profound
how to the barbed, unfolded to 7times newspaper, which he
carried under his arm, and held it p to Wriggle.

robert.
HIgh wages :-high wages I'' screamed the magic.
Is this yours, sie7'' replies the little man, pointing to
an advertisement in the newspaper.
 Yes, yes, that's my alcrtisement, friend,'' replied MIr.
Trying.  But what of it
fare the little man could answer, a slight interruption
occurred. While eyeing the new comer, Watts neglected to

he burnt the song-looking gentleman's forehead, and
single his hair.

4 Yes I take care, sir, as Judge Learmouth observes to
a saucy witness,'' cried INtrigue--' ` take care, or 'll commit
you I
e D-n Judge Learmouth f cried the gentleman,
angrily. If I were a judge, To hang such a careless
fellow.''
Sarre him right 1'' screamed Man-`` save him

Beg pardon, sir,'' cried Watts.  Ill rectify you in
minute.''
 Well, my little friend,'' observed Bridge, '`and what
nay be your object in coming to me, as the great con-
veyancer, Mr. Plodwell, obseres to his clients-what may
be your object 7'
 You want an assistant, don't you, sir 1'' rejoined the
little man, humbly.
:Do you apply on your own account, or on behalf of a
fiend 7' asked INtrigue.
On my own,'' replied the little man.
 What are your qualifications 1' demanded Trying-
what are your qualifications 2''
I fancy I understand something of the business,''
replied the little man. I was a perruquier myself, when
wigs were more in fashion than they are now.''
TIME BARBER OF LONDON.

 Ha1 indeed1'' said Trying, laughing. That must
have been in the last century-in Queen Anne's time-eh 2''
e You have hit it exactly, sir,'' replied the little man.
 It was in Queen Anne's time.''
 Perhaps you recollect when wigs were first worn, my
little Story,'' cried Mr. INtrigue.
Perfectly,'' replied the little man.  French peering
were first worn in Charles the Second's time.''
4You saw 'em, of course?'' cried the barbed, with a sneer.
e I did,'' replied the little man, quietly.
 Oh, he must be out of his mind,'' eriel Trying. 4 In
hall have a commission de lunatico to issue here, as the
Master of the Rolls would observe.''
I hope I may suit you, sir,'' said the little man.
I don't think you will, my friend,' replied Mr. Trying;
i don't think you will. You don't seem to have a hand for
hairdressing. Are you aware of the talent the art
requires? Are you aware that it has cost me to earn the
enviable title of the Barter of London? 'm as proud of
that title as if I were-''
Lord Chancellor 1-Lord Chancellor I' screamed Man.
 Precisely, Man,'' said MIr. Rugged; `` as if I were Lord
Chancellor.''
 Well, 'm sorry for it,'' said the little man, dis-
consolately.
ee Pretty dear I'' screamed Make; `' pretty dear 1'
 What a wonderful bird you have got a'' said the sour-
looking gentleman, rising and paying Mr. INtrigue. i
declare its answers are quite appropriate''

 Ah 1 Msg is a clever creature, sir-that she is,''
replied the barbed. `I gave a good deal for her.''
` Little or nothing I'' screamed Man-`little
nothing l''
e What is your name, friend2'' said the gentleman, ad-
dressing the little man, who still lingered in the shop.
4 Why, sir, Ve had many names in my time,'' he replied.
`At one time I was called Flapdragon-at another, Old
Pair-but my real name, I believe, is More-Gregory
More.''
An Old Bailey answer,'' cried MIr. Trying, shaking his
head. Flapdragon, alias Old Pair-alias Gregory More
-along----.''
Pretty dear 1'' screamed MIag.
``And you want as place l'' demanded the sour-looking
gentleman, eyeing him narrowly.
Sadly,'' replied More.
Well, then, follow me,'' said the gentleman, ''and All
zeo what can be done for you.''
And they left the shop together.

TR TOO I TR FIRST QUARTER.
In spite of his resolution to the contrary, Mardol found
it impossible to resist the fascination of Ebb's society, and
became a daily visitor at her father's house. Mr. Thorney-
croft noticed the growing attachment between them with
satisfaction. His great wish was to see his daughter united
to the husband of her choice, and in the hope of smoothing
the way, to let Mardol understand that he should give her
a considerable marriage-portion.
For the last few days a wonderful alteration had taken
place in Mardol's manner, and he seemed to have shaken off
altogether the cloud that had hitherto sat upon his spirits.
Enchanted by the change, Ebbs indulged in the most bliss-
ful anticipations of the future.
One evening they walked forth together, and almost
unconsciously directed their steps towards the river. Lin-
going on its banks, they gazed on the full tide, admired
the glorious sunset, and breathed over and over again those
tender nothings so eloquent in lovers' ears.
 Oh1 how different you are from what you were as week
ago,'' said Ebba, playfull. Promise me not to indulge
in any more of those gloomy fancies.''
Will not indulge in them if I can help it, rest assured

sweet Ebba,'' he replied.  But my spirits are not always
under my control. I am surprised at my own cheerfulness
this evening.''
I never felt so happy,'' she replied; ``and the whole
scene is in unison with my feelings. How soothing is the
calm river flowing at one feel-how tender is the warm
sky, still flushed with red, though the sun has set I-And
see, under hangs the crescent moon. He is in her first
quarter.''
 The moon in her first quarter t'' cried Mardol, in a tone
of anguish. All then is her.''
 What means this sudden change ?' cried Ebba, fright-
ended by his looks.
 Oh, Ebba,'' he replied, ``I must lace you. I have
allowed myself to dream of happiness too long. I am an
-:::
accursed being, doomed only to bring misery pon those
not believe me. Let me go, and perhaps it may not yet be
too late to save you.''
e Oh no, do not leave me l'' cried Ebba. :I have no
fear while you are with me.''
ee But you do not know the terrible fate I am linked to,'
he said.  This is the night when it will be accomplished.''
 Your moody fancies do not alarm me as they used to
do, dear Mardol,'' she rejoined, '` because i know them to be
the fruit of a diseased imagination. Come, let us continue
our walk,'' she added, taking his arm kindly.
Ebba,'' he cried, ` I implore you to let me go I had
not the power to tear myself away unless you and me.''

 'm glad to hear it,'' she rejoined, '`' for then I hall
hold you fast''
You know not what you do'' cried Mardol.  Release
me1 oh, release me I'
 In a few moments the fit will be passed,'' she rejoined.
 Let us walk towards the abbey.''
It is in ain to struggle against fate,'' ejaculated
Mardol, despairingly.
And he suffered himself to be led in the direction pro-
posed.
Ebba continued to talk, but hoer disconrse fell upon a
deaf ear, and at last she became silent too. In this way
they proceeded along Millbank-street and Abingdon-street,
until, turning off on the right, they found themselves
before an old and partly-demolished building. By this
time it had become quite dark, for the moon was hidden
behind a back of clouds, but a light was seen in the upper
story of the structure, oceasioned, no doubt, by a fire within
it, which gave a very picturesque effect to the broken outline
of the walls.
Pausing for a moment to contemplate the ruin, Ebba
expressed a wish to enter it. Mardol offered no opposition,
and passing through an arched doorway, and ascending a
short, spiral, stone staircase, they presently married at
roofless chamber, which it was evident, from the implements
and rubbish lying about, was about to be dazed to the
ground. On one side there was a large are, partly
pricked up, through which opened s narrow doray,
though at some height from the ground. With this a

plank communicated, while beneath it lay a great heap of
stones, amongst which were some grotesque cared hers.
In the centre of the chamber was a large square opening,
like the mouth of a trap-door, from which the top of a
ladder projeeted, and near it stood a flaming brazier, which
had cast forth the glare seen from below. Her the
ruinous walls on the right hung the crescent moon, now
emerged from the cloud, and shedding a ghostly glimmer
on the scene.
 What a strange place'' devil Ebba, gazing around
with some apprehension.  It looks like a spot one reads
of in romance. I wonder where that trap leads to 2''
 Into the vault beneath, no doubt,'' replied Mardol.
 But why did we come hither 7''
As he spoke, there was a sound like mocking laughter,
but whence arising it was difficult to say.
 Did you hear that sound '' cried Mardol.
 It was nothing but the echo of laughter from the
street,'' she replied.  You alarm yourself without reason,
Mardol.'
No, not without reason,'' he cried. ``I am in the power
of a terrible being, who seeks to destroy you, and I know
that he is at hand. Listen to me, Ebb, and however
strange my recital may appear, do not suppose it the
ravings of a madman, but be assured it is the truth.''
 Beware 1'' cried a deep voice, issuing apparently from
the depths of the vault.
 Some one spoke,'' cried Ebba. ``I begin to share
our apprehension. Let us quit this place.''

sEE IoOON IN TE FIRST QUARTER 103
 Come, then,'' said Mardol.
t Not so fast,'' cried a deep voice.
And they beheld the mysterious owner of the black cloak
barring their passage on.
t Ebba, you are mine,'' cried the stranger. ` Mardol
has brought you to me.''
 It is closE' cried Mardol. ee I never will yield her to
you.''
e Remember your compact,'' rejoined the stranger, with
a mocking laugh.
 Oh, Aurioll'' cried Ebba, ' I fear for your soul. You
had not made s compact with this fiend'"
. J He has,'' replied the stranger; `" and by that compact
you are surrendered to me,''
And, as he spoke, he advanced towards her, and envelope-
in her in his cloak, her cries were instantly stifled.
.  You shall not go' cried Mardol, seizing him. : Re-
sense her, or I renounce you wholly.''
4 For l'' cried the stranger, ``since you provoke my
wrath, take your doom.''
And he stamped on the ground. At this signal an arm
wasthrust from the trap-door, and Mardol's hand was seized
with an iron grasp.
While this took place, the stranger bore his lovely burden
a fly up the plank leading to the narrow doorway in the
wall, and just as he was passing through it he pointed towards
the sky, and shouted with a mocking smile to Burial-
 Behold the moon is in her first quarter. My words
are fulfilled1
104
And he disappeared.
MARDOL.
Mardol tried to disengasge himself from the grasp im-
posed upon him in vain. Uttering cjaeulations of rage and
despair, he was dragged forcibly backwards into the vault.
OuR morning, to persons took their way along Karina-
ment-street and Whitehall, and, chatting as they walked,
turned into the entrance of Spring-gardens, for the purpose
of looking at the statue at Charing-cross. One of them
was remarkable for his dwarfish stature and strange
withered features. The other was a man of middle size,
thin, rather elderly, and with a sharp countenance, to
countess of which was redeeed by a strong expression of
benevolence. HE was clad in a black coat, rather rusty,
but well brushed, buttoned up to the chin, black tights,
short drum gaiters, and wore a white neckcloth and sped-
table.
Mr. Loftas (for so he was called) was a retired merchant,
of moderate fortune, and lived in Abingdon-street. He
was a bachelor, and therefore pleased himself; and being

a bit of an sanctuary, rambled about all day long in search
of some object of interest. His walk, on the present
occasion, was taken with that vice.
eDy Lovely what a noble statue that is, MOrrow1'' cried

THE STATUE AT CIAING-COME8. 105
Loftus, gazing at it. te The horse is magnificent-post-
lively magnificent.''
 I recollect when the spot was occupied by a gaiety,
and when, in lieu of a statue, an effigy of the martyred
:.::::;:--
the time of the Proteetorate.''
 You cannot get those dreams out of your head, More,''
said Loftus, smiling.  I wish I could persuade myself I
had lived for two centuries and a half,''
 Would you could had seen the ancient across, which
once stood there, erected by Edward the First to his beloved
wife, ' Languor of Castile,''' said Mrs, heedless of the
other's remark.  It was much mutilated when I remember
it; some of the pinnacles were broken, and the foliage
defaced, but the statues of the queen were still standing in
the recesses; and altogether the effect was beautiful,''
It must have been charming,'' observed Loftus, rubbing
his hands; '`and, tough I like the statue, I would much
rather have had the old Gothic cross. But how fortunate
the former escaped destruction in Older Cromwell's time.''
 I can tell you how that came to pass, sir,'' replied
More, `` for I was assistant to John Rivers, the brasier, to
whom the statue was sold,'
 Ah indeed 1'' exclaimed Loftns. %I have heard some-
thing of the story, but should like to have full particulars.''
 You shall hear them, then,'' replied More. :You
statue, which, as you know, was cast by Heart le Sueur,
in 1633, was ordered by parliament to be sold and broken

to pieces. Well, my master, John Rivers, being a staunch
royalist, though he did not dare to how his principles,
106
VIoL.
determined to preserve it from destruction. Accordingly,
he offered a good round sum for it, and was declared to
purehaser. But how to dispose of it was the difficulty 1
He could trust none of his men but me, whom he knew to
be as hearty a hater of the Roundheads, and as loyal to
the memory of our slaughtered sovereign, as himself.
Well, we dogged a great pit, secretly, in the cellar, whither
the state had been honeyed, and buried it. The job
occupied us nearly a month; and during that time, my
master collected together all the pieces of old brass he
could procure. These he afterwards produced, and declared
they were the fragments of the statue. But the cream of
the jest was to come. He began to cast handloes of knives
and forks in brass, giving it out that they were made from
the metal of the statue. And plenty of 'em he sold too,
for the Cavaliers bought 'em as memories of their martyred
monarch, and the Roundheads as evidences of his fall. In
this way he soon got back his outlay,''
Ha1 ha I ha l'' laughed Loftus.
 All, in due season came the Restoration,'' pursued
MOre; `` and my master made known to King Charles tha
Second the treasure he had kept concealed for him. It
was dogged forth, placed in its old position-but I forget
whether the brasier was rewarded. I rather think not,''
 No matter,'' cried Loftus; '' he was sufficiently re-
warded by the consciousness of having done a noble action.
But let us go and examine the sculpture on the pedestal
]more closely.''

THE STATUE AT CIAING-CROSs. 107
Why this, he crossed over the road; and, taking off his
hat, thrust his head through the iron railing surrounding
the pedestal, while More, in order to point out the beauties
of the sculptnre with greater convenience, mounted upon a
stump beside him.
 You are aware that this is the work of Grinding Gig-
boys, sir1'' cried the dwarf,
ee To be sure I am,'' replied Loftus-`` to be sure. What
fancy and gust is displayed in the treatment of these
trophies I'
 The execution of the royal arms is equally admirable,''
cried More.
 Never saw anything finer,'' rejoined Loftus-'`never,
upon my lite."
Eery one knows how easily a crowd is collected in
London, and it cannot be supposed that our two antiquaries
would be allowed to pursue their investigations unmolosted.
Several ragged rejoins got round them, and tried to dis-
cover what they were looking at, at the same time cutting
their jokes upon them. These were speedily joined by
a street-deeper, rather yong in the profession, a ticket-
porter, a butcher's apprcntice, an old Israelitish clothes-man,
a coalheaver, and a couple of charity-boys.
My eyes.'' cried the street-sweeter, '`only twig these
does. If they ain't green 'us, IT done.''
Old Spectacles thinks he has found it all out,'' re-
marked the porter; ``ve shall hear wot it all means, by-
and-by''

 Flesh ma 'art,'' cried the Jew, '`at two funny old
gentlemen. I wonder at they thinks they sees''
 TIll tell 'ee, master,'' rejoined the butcher's apprentice;
2they're a train' ich on 'em can see farthest into as mill-
stone.''
 Only think of living all my life in London, and never
examining this admirable work of art before I'' tried Loftus,
quite unconscious that he had become the object of general
curiosity.
 Look closer at it, old gem'man,'' cried the porter.
 The nearer you get, the more you'll admire it''
`'Quite true,'' replied Loftus, fancying More had spoken;
5ll bear the closest inspection.''
I say, New,'' observed one of the charity-boys to the
other, '` do you get over the railin'; they must he' dropped
summat inside. See what it is.''
e I'm afraid o' spring' myself, Joe,'' replied the other;
but just give us as lift, and All try.''
 Wot are you after there, you young rascalat'' cried th
coalheaver; `' come down, or All send the perlico to you.''

lad, accompanied by a bull-dog. Is a good mind to
chuck the little 'un off the post, and sat Tartar at him.

 That ud be famous fun, indeed, Spider I' cried another
rapscallion behind him.
Sarah let 'me alone, will you there, you young
ladies I'' eriel an Irish bricklayer; ' don't you see they'ra
only two paiccable antiquaries.''


THE STATUE AT CHARING-CROSS. 109
Oh, they're antiquaries, are they 7'' screamed the little
street-sweeter. tA Well, I never see the likes on 'em afore;
did you, Sum '
 Never,'' replied the porter.
 Oh, further in Irish l1 ye're upsettin' me, an' all the
fruits of my industry,'' cried an applewoman, against whom
the bricklayer and run his barrow.  Devil seize you for
careless wagabone Why don't you look where ye're goin',
and not drive into people in that way 7''
'Ages pardon, Molly,'' said the bricklayer; 'but I was
so interested in them antiquaries, that I didn't barren ye.''
 Antiquaries be hanged1 what's such warmint to me ''
cried the applewoman, furiously.  You've destroyed my
day's market, and bad luck to ye''
 WeIl, never heed, Molly,'' cried the good-natured brick-
layer;  Ill make it up t'ye. Pick up your apples, and
you shall have a drop of the rather if you'll come along

While this was passing, a stout gentleman came from
-- Why, brother-in-law, is that you 7''
But Loftus was too much engrossed to notice him, and
that i stone a r he.
 What are you talking about, brother '' cried the stout
gentleman.
 Trifling Gibbons,'' replied Loftus, without turning
round.  Horace Walpole said that no one before him
could gie to wood the airy lightness of a flower, and here
he has given it to a stone,''

DAILY.
 This may be all very fine, my good fellow,'' said the
stout gentleman, seizing him by the shoulder, but don't
you see the crowd you're collccting round you7 You'll be
robbed presently.''
 Why, how the devil did you come here, brother Thou-
neycroft ' cried Loftus, at last recognisiag him.
 Come along, and TIs tell you,'' replied the iron-her-
chant, dragging him away, while MOre followed closely be-
hind them.  Am so glad to have met you,'' pursued To-
neycroft, as soon as they were clear of the mob; "` you'll be
shocked to hear what has happened to your niece, Ebba.
e Why, what has happened to her2'' demanded Lofts.
 You alarm me. Out with it at once. I hate te be kept
in suspense.''
 She has left me,'' replied Thorneyeroft-t left her old
indulgent father-run away.''
e Run away'' oxelaimod Loftus. " Impossible1 TI
not believe it-even from your lips.''
4 Would it were not so-but it is, alas too true,'' re-
plied Thorneycroft, mournfully. And the thing was so
unnecessary, for I would gladly he given her to the

 No, she is too high principle for that,'' period Loftas.

asked Thorneyeroft.
 I am sorry I cannot,'' replied More. `I only saw
him for a few minutes the other night, after I had been

cloak.''
 What's that you say 7'' cried Thorneycroft, quickly.
I have heard Ebba speak of a tall man in a black cloak
having some mysterious connexion with Mardol. I hope
that person has nothing to do with her disappearance.''

Thorneycroft. wHat is to be done 1''

ABOUT.
PREPARATIOB.
O that some night, at the appointed hour, Mr. Homely-
croft ropaired to Shoreditch, and entering a narrow street
belinda to church, speedily discovered the Turk's Head, at
the door of which a hackey-coach was standing. He was
shown by the landlord into a small back room, in which
three men were seated at a small table, smoking, and
drinking in and water, while a fourth was standing near
the fire, with his back towards the door. The Matter was a
tall powerfnlly-built man, wrapped in s rough great-coat,
and did not turn round on the iron-merchant's entrance.
e You are punctunl, Mr. Thornoycroft,'' said Ginger,
who was one of the trio at the table; ' and Am happy to
say, I've arranged everything' for you, sir. My friends are
ready to undertake the job. Only they don't do it on
quite sich easy terms as mine.''
The Tinker and the Scandal coughcd slightly, to into-
mate their entire occurrence in MIr. Ginger's remark,
As 1I said to you this morning', Mr. Thorneycroft,''
pursued Ginger, `` this is a difficult and a dangerous
bus'ness, and there's no known' wot may come on it,
But it's your only chance o' recovering' your darted.''
 As, is your only chance,'' echoed the Tinker.

SEPARATION.
115
 W're about to risk our precious lives for you, sir,''
said the Scandal ; `` so, in course, ve expeets a perportionato

 If you enable me to regain my daughter, you shall not
find me ungrateful,'' joined the iron-merchant.
 I must have a hundred ponds,'' said the Tinker-
e that's my lowest''
2: And mine, too,'' said the Scandal.
 I shall take coffin' but the glory, as I said afore,''
remarked Ginger. `` I'm sworn champion o' poor distressed
young damsils; but my friends must make their own
bargins.''
 el, I assent,'' retamned Mr. Thorneycroft; '`and the
sooner we set out the better.''
 Are you named 7'' asked Ginger.
 In a brace of pistols in my pocket,'' replied Thou-
neycroft.
 All right, then-ve've all got pots and cutlashes,''
said Ginger.  So let's be off,
As he spoke, the Tinker and Scandal arose; and the
man in the rough great-coat, who had hitherto remained
with his back to them, turned round. To the iron-her-
chant's surprise, he perceived that the face of this indi-
vainly was covered with a piece of black crape.
 Who is this l'' he demanded with some misgiving.
 A friend,'' replied Ginger.  Vthout him e could
do stuff.' His name is Receks, and he is the chief man in
our enterprise.''

e He claims a reward too, I suppose 7' said Thorneyecroft

116
MARDOL.
e I will tell you what reward I claim, Mr Thorneycroft,''
rejoined Seeks, in a deep stern tone, ` when all is over
Meantime, give me your solemn pledge, that whatever you
may behold to-night, you will not divulge it.''
I give it,'' replied the iron-merchant, `` provided
always---''
 No provision, sir,'' interrupted the other, quickly.
4 on must swear to keep silence uneonditionally, or I
will not move a footstep with you; and I alone can guide
you where your daughter is detained.''
 Swear, sir; it is your only chance,'' whispered Ginger.
 Well, if it must be, I do swear to keep silence,'' re-
joined Mr. Thorneycroft;  bat your proceedings appear
very mysterious.''
e The whole affair is mysterious,'' replied Weeks, t You
must also consent to have a bandage passed her your
eyes when you get into the coach.''
 Anything more 7'' asked the iron-merchant.
 You must engage to obey my orders, without hues-
tioning, when we arrive at our destination,'' rejoined Weeks.
:
 Otherwise, there is no chance of success.''
 To it as you will,'' returned Thorneyeroft,  I must
be All then is clearly understood,'' said Weeks, `' and we
can now set out,''
Upon this, Ginger conducted Mr. Thorneyeroft to the
coach, and as soon as the latter got into it, tied a handker-
chief tightly over his eyes. In this state Mr. Thorneyeroft

heard the Tinker and the Scandal take their places near
him, but not remarking the voice of Reeds, concluded that
he must have got outside.
The next moment, the coach was put in motion, and
rattled over the stones at a rapid pace. It made many
turns; but at length proceeded steadily onwards, while
from the profound silence around, and the greater freshness
of the air, Mr. Thorneycroft began to fancy they had gained
the country. Not a word was spoken by any one during
the ride.
After a while, the coach stopped, the door was opened,
and Mr. Thorneyeroft was helped out. The iron-merchant
expected his bandage would now be removed, but he was
mistaken, for Weeks, taking his arm, drew him along at a
quick pace. As they advanced, the iron-merchant's con-
doctor whispered him to be cautious, and, at the same
time, made him keep close to a wall. A door was
presently opened, and as soon as the party had passed
through it, closed.
The bandage was then roused from Thormneyerof's
eyes, and he found himself in a large and apparently ne-
elected garden. Though the sky was cloudy, there was
light enough to enable him to distinguish that they were
near an old dilapidated mansion.
 We are now arrived,'' said Reeds, to the iron-merchant,
`and you will have need of all your resolution.''
I ill deliver her, or perish in the attempt,'' said
Thorneeroft, taking out his pistols.

The others drew their classes.
 Now then, follow me,'' said Weeks, ``and yet as I
direct.'
With this he struck into an alley formed by thick hedges
of print, which brought them to the back part of the
house. Passing through a door, he entered the yard, and
creeping cautiously along the wall, reached a low window,
which he contrived to open without noise. He then passed
through it, and was followed by the others.

WE shall now return to the night of Ebba's seizare by
the mysterious stranger. Though almost deprived of con-
seriousness by terror, the poor girl could distinguish, from
the movements of her vapour, that she was borne down a
flight of steps, or some steep descent, and then for a con-
siderablo distance along feel ground. Shows next place
in a carriage, which was driven with great swiftness, and
though it was impossible to conjecture in what direction
she was indeed, it seemed to her terrified imagination as
if she were hurried down s precipice, and she expected
eery moment to be dashed in pieces. At length, the
vehicle stopped, and she was lifted out of it, and carried
along a winding passage; after which, the creaking of
hinges announced that a door was opened. Having passed

through it, he was deposited on a bench, when, fright her-
mastering her, her senses completely forsook her.
On recovering, she found herself seated on a fauteuil
covered with black velvet, in the midst of a gloomy chamber
of vast extent, while beside her, and supporting her from
falling, stood the mysterious and terrible stranger. HIs
hell a large goblet filled with some potent liquid to her
lips, and compelled her to swallow a portion of it. The
powerful stimulant revived her, but, at the same time, pro-
duced a strange excitement, against which she struggled
with all her power. Her persecutors again held the goblet
towards her, while a sardonic smile played upon his features.
 Drink :'' he cried; ``it will restore you, and you have
much to go through.''
Ebba mechanically took the cup, and raised it to her
lips, but noticing the stranger's glance of exultation, dashed
it to the ground.
e You have acted foolishly,'' ho sail, sternly; ``the potion
would have done you good.''
Withdrawing her eyes from his gaze, which she felt
exercised an irresistible influence over her, Ebbas gazed fear-
fully round the chamber.
It was vast and gloomy, and seemed like the interior of
a sepulchre-the walls and ceiling being formed of black
marble, while the door was paved with the same material.
Not far from where she sat, on an estrade, approached by
a couple of steps, stood a table covered with black velvet,
on which was placed an immense lamp, fashioned like an
amp supporting a cauldron on his outstretched wings. In

this lamp were several banner, which cast a lurid light
throughout the chamber. Her it hung a cap equally fan-
tastically fashioned. A udagger, with a richly-wrought
hill, was stuck into the table; and beside it lay a strangely
shaped mask, an open book, an antique instant, and a
piece of parchment, on which some characters ere inscribed.
Opposite these stood a curiously-carved ebony chair.
At the lower end of the room, which was slightly elevated
above the rest, hung a large black curtain; and on the
step, in the front of it, were placed two vases of jet.
 WHat is behind that curtain?'' shudleringly demanded
Ebb of her companion.
You will see anon,'' he replied. ' Meanwhile, seat
yourself on that chair, and glance at the writing on the
scroll''
Ebbs did not more, but the stranger took her hand, and
drew her to the seat.
" Read what is written on that paper,'' he cried, im-
seriously.
Ebb glanced at the document, and a shudder passed
over her frame.
By this,'' she cried, "I surrender myself, soul and
body, to you t'
You do,'' replied the stranger.
tI had committed no crime that can place me within
the power of the Fiend,'' cried Ebbs, falling upon her
knees. `'I call upon Heaven for protection Vaunt''

the lamp, and the chamber was buried in profound darkness.
MOcking laughter rang in her ears, succeeded by wailing
cries inexpressibly dreadful to hear.
Ebbs continued to pray fervently for her own deliverance,
and for that of Mardol. In the midst of her supplications
she was aroused by strains of music of the most exquisite
sweetness, proceeding apparently from behind the curtain,
and while listening to these sounds she was startled by a
denfening crash as if as large gong had been stricken. The
cover of the lamp was then slowly raised, and the burners
blazed forth as before, while from the to vases in front of
the curtain arose clouds of incense, filling the chamber with
stupifying fragrance.
Again the gong was stricken, and Ebba looked round
towards the curtain. Above each vase towered a gigantic
figure, wrapped in a long black clock, the lower part of
which was congealed by the thick vapour. Moods, like tha
cowls of monks, were drawn her the heads of these grim
and motionless figures; mufflers enroloped their coins, and
they wore masks, from the holes of which gleamed eyes of
unearthly brightness. Their hands were crossed upon
their breasts. Between them sqnatted two other spectrnl
forms, similar cloaked, hooded, and asked, with their
gleaming eyes fixed upon her, and their skins fingers
pointed derisiely at her.
Behind the curtain was placed a strong light, which
showed a wide staircase of black marble, leading to some
upper chamber, and at the same time threw the reflection ol

 gigantic figure upon the drapery, while a hand, the finger
of which pointed towards her, was thrust from an opening
between its folds.
Forcibly averting her gaze, Head covered her eyes with
her hands, but looking up again after a brief space, beheld
an ebon door at the side resolve upon its hinges, and give
entrance to three female figures, robed in black, hoodel and
veiled, and having their hands folded, in a melancholy
manner, across their breasts. Slowly and noiselessly
advancing, they halted within a few paces of her.
 Who, and what are ye 1'' she cried, wild with terror.
 The victims of Mardol 1'' replied the figure on the right.
2As we are, such will you be ere long.''
 What crime have you committed?'' demanded Ebba.
 We have loved him,'' replied the second figure.
 Is that a crime'' cried Ebba.  If so, I am equally
culpable with you.''
 You will share our doom,'' replied the third fire.
t Heaven have mercy upon me'' exclaimed the agonised
girl, dropping upon her knees.
At this moment a terrible voice from behind the curtain
exclaimed-
Sign, or Mardol is lost for ever.''
e I cannot yield my soul, even to save him,'' cried Ebba,
distractelly.
 Witness his chastisement, then,'' cried the voice.
And as the words were uttered, a side door was opened
on the opposite side, and Mardol was dragged forth from it

by two asked personages, who looked like familiar of the
question.
Do not yield to the demands of this fiend, Ebba1
cried Mardol, gazing at her distractedly.
wIll you saw him before he is cast, living, into the
tomb 1'' cried the voice.
And at the words, a heavy slab of marble rose slowly
from the floor near here Ebba sat, and disclosed a dark
pit beneath.
Ebba gazed into the abyss with indescribable terror.
There he will be murmured, unless you sign,'' cried the
voice; '` and, as he is immortal, he will endure an eternity
of torture.''
I cannot save him so, but I may precede him,'' cried
Ebba. And throwing her hands aloft, she flung herself into
the pit.
A fearful cry resonnded through the chamber. It broke
from Mardol, who only strove to burst from those who
held him, and precipitate himself after Ebba
Soon after this, and while Mardol was gazing into the
abyss, a tongue of blue flame arose from it, danced for a
moment in the air, and then vanished. No sooner was it
gone than a figure, shrouded in black habiliments, and
hooded and muffled no like the three other female forms,
slowly ascended from the vault, apparently without support,
and remained motionless at its brink.
 Deal'' exclaimed Mardol, in a voice of despair.  Is
it you?'

The figure bowed its head, but spoke not.
`Sign 1'' thundered the voice. 4 Your attempt at self-
destruction has placed you wholly in m power. SignS''
At this injunction, the figure moved slowly towards the
table, and, to his unspeakable horror, Mardol beheld it take]
up the pen and write upon the parchment. He bent for-
ward, and saw that the name inscribed thereon was EsnA]
ITonxYCROFT.
The groan to which he gave utterance was echoed byas
roar of diabolical laughter.
The figure then moved slowly away, and ranged itself
with the other veiled forms.
 All is accomplished,'' cried the voice. Away with
him
On this, a terrible clangour was heard; the lights were
extinguished; and Mardol was dragged through the door-
way from which he had been brought forth.
entered,-1800.,
---
O the night of the 1st of March, 1800, and at a late
hour, a man, wrapped in a large herdsman's cloak, and of
strange and sinister appearance, entered an old deserted
house in the neighbourhood of Scenery-green. He was tall,
carried himself very erect, and seemed in the full vigour of
early manhood; but his features had a worn and ghastly
look, as if bearing the stamp of long-indulged and frightful
excesses, while his dark gleaming eyes gave him an ex-
passion almost diabolical.
This person had gained the house from a garden behind
it, and now stood in a large dismantled hall, from which a
broad oaken staircase, with curiously-cared banisters, led
to a gallery, and thence to the upper chambers of the habit-
station. Nothing could be more dreary than the aspect of
the place. The richly-moulded ceiling was festooned with
spiders' webs, and in some places had fallen in heaps upon
the floor; the glories of the tapestry upon the walls ware
obliterated by damp; the squares of black and white
marble, with which the hall was pavet, were loosened, and

asked beneath the footsteps; the wide and empty fireplace
yawned like the mouth of a caern; the bolts of the closed
windows were rushed in their sockets; and the heaps of
dust before the outer door proved that long years had
celaypscd since any one had passed through it.
Taking a dark lantern from beneath his cloak, the indi-
donald in question gazed for a moment around him, and
then, with a sardonic smile playing upon his features,
directed his steps towards a room on the right, the door of
which stood open.
This chamber, which was large and cased with oak, was
wholly unfuruishel, like the hall, and in an equally dining-
dated condition. Tha only decoration remaining on its
walls was the portrait of a venerable personage in the cap
and gown of Henry the Eighth's time, painted against a
panel-a circumstance which had probably saved it from
destruction-and beneath it, fixed in another panel, a plate
of brass, covered with mystical characters and symbols, and
inscribed with the name springs e IReugement, 5fra. I.C.
The same name likewise appeared upon a abel beneath the
portrait, with the date, 1550.
Pausing before the portrait, the young man threw the
light of the lantern full upon it, and revealed features
somewhat resembling his own in form, but of a seer and
philosophic cast. In the eyes alone could be discerned the
peculiar nnl terrible glimmer which distinguished his own
glances.
After regarding the portrait for some time fixellr, h
thus address it:
ThE TOMB OF THE OSICRUCIA. 127
 Dost hear me, old aneestor7'' he cried. 4I, thy de-
scendant, Cyprian de Rougemont, call upon thee to point out
where the gold is hidden1 I know that thou wert a brother
of the Rosy Cross-one of the illuminati-and didst pen-
rate the mysteries of nature, and enter the region of light.
I know, also, that thou wert buried in this house with a
not treasure; but though I have made diligent search for
it, and others have searched before me, thy grave his never
yet been discovered: Listen to me Methought Satan
appeared to me in a dream last night, and bade me come
hither, and I should find what I sought. The conditions
ho proposed were, that I should either gie him my own
soul, or in him that of Mardol Day. I assented. I am
here. Where is thy treasure?''
After a pause, he struck the portrait with his clenched
hand, exclaiming, in a loud voice:
 Dost hear me, I say, old ancestor7 I call on the to
give me thy treasure. Dost hear, I say 7''
And ho repeated the blow with greater violence.
Disturbed by the shock, the brass plate beneath the pig-
sure started from its place, and fell to the ground.
 WHat is this1'' cried Rougemont, gazing into the
aperture loft by the plate. ` Hal-my invocntion has been
heard I
And, snatching up the lantern, he discovered, at the
bottom of a little recess, about two feet deep, a stone, with
isn iron ring in the centre of it. Uttering a joyful cry, he
seized the ring, and drew the stone forward without stiff-
could, disclosing an open space beyond it.

 This, then, is the entrance to my ancestor's tomb,''
cried Rougemont; '` there can be no doubt of it. The old
Rosicrucian has kept his secret well; but the devil has
helped me to wrest it from him. And now to procure the
necessary implements, in case, ass is not unlikely, I should
experience further difficulty.''
With this, he hastily quitted the room, but returned al-
most immediately with a mallet, a lever, and a pitchfork;
armed with which and the lantern, he crept through the
aperture. THis done, he found himself at the head of a
stone staircase, which he descended, and came to the arched
entrance of a vault. The door, which was of stout task, as
locked, but holding up the light towards it, he read the
following inscription:
or c.o.L. AND8 PATh, 1550.
In two hundred and fifty years I shall open l'' cried
Rougemont, `' and the date 1350-why, the exact time is
arrived. Old Cyprian must have foreseen what would

happen, and evidently intended to make me his heir.

THE TOMB Of THE ROSE1OBOOLAN. 129
the moon, around. This, then, was tha her-burning lamp
of the Rosierucians, and lougemont gazed at it with asto-
punishment. Two hundred and fifty years had elapsed since
with its tail in its mouth-an emblem of eternity-wrought
in purest gold; while aboot it were a pair of silver wing,
in allusion to the soul. Massive chains of the more costly
metal, fashioned like twisted snakes, served as suspenders
to the lamp.
But Rougemont's astonishment at this marvel quickly
gave way to other feelings, and he gazed around the vault
with greedy eyes.
It was a eeptilateral chamber, about eight feet high, built
of stone, and supported by beautifully groaned arches. The
surface of the masonry was as smooth and fresh as if the
chisel had only just left it.
In six of the corners were placed large chests, ornamented
with ironwork of the most exquisite workmanship, and these
Rougemont's imagination pictured as filled with inexhans-
table treasure; while in the seventh corner, near the door,
was a beautiful little piece of monumental sculpture in white
marble, representing two kneeling and hooded figures, hold-
in a veil between them, which partly concealed the
entrance to a small recess. On one of the chests opposite
the monument just described stood s strangely-formed
bottle and as cup of antique workmanship, both encrusted
with gems.
The walls were covered with circles squares, and dis

grass, and in some places were ornamented with grotesque
carvings. In the centre of the vault was a round altar, of
black marble, covered with a plate of gold, on which Rouge-
mont read the following inscription:
be fingers cemenuium this his sepulcrum life.
 RIver, then, old Cyprian lips,'' he cried.
And, prompted by some irresistible impulse, he seized
the altar by the upper rim, and oerthrew it. The heavy
mass of marble fell with a thundering crash, breaking
asunder the flag beneath it. It might be the roverberation
of the vaulted roof, but a deep groan seemed to reproach
the young man for his sacrilege. Undeterred, however, by
this warning, Rongemont placed the point of the lever
between the interstices of thine broken stone, und, exerting
all his strength, speedily raised the fragments, and laid open
the grave.
Within it, in the garb he were in life, with his white
beard streaming to his waist, lay the uncoffined body of his
ancestor, Cyprian de Rougenont. The corpse and evidently
been carefully cmbalmed, and the features were unchanged
by decay. Upon the breast, with the hands placed her it,
lay a large book, bound in black vellum, and fastened with
brazen clasps. Instantly possessing himself of this my-
serious-looking volume, IRougemont knelt upon the nearest
chest, and opened it. But he was disappointed in his
expectation. All the pages he examined were filled with
cabalistic characters, which he was totally unable to de-
cipher.
At length, however, he chanced upon one page, the
THE STORY OF THE OSICRCCIAN. 131
import of which he comprehended, and he remained for
some tie absorbed in its contemplation, while an almost
friends smile played upon his features.
``Ah l'' he exclaimed, closing the volume, '` I see now
the cause of my extraordinary dream. My ancestor'a
wondrous power was of infernal origin-the result, in
fact, of a compact with the Prince of Darkness. But
what care I for that? Give me wealth-no matter what
source it comes from l-ha: hnl''
And seizing the leer, he broke open the chest beside
him. It was filled with bars of silver. The next he
visited in the sand way was full of gold. The third was
laden with pearls and precious stones; and the rest con-
gained treasure to an incalculable among. Rougemont
gazed at them in transports of joy.
 At length I have my wish,'' he cried.  Boundless
wealth, and therefore boundless power is mine. I can riot
in pleasure-riot in vengeance. As to my soul, I will run
the risk of its perlition; but it shall go hard if I destroy
not that of Mardol. IIi love of play and his passion for
with About shall be the means by which I will or. But
I must not neglect another agent which is offered me. That
bottle, I have learnt from you volume, contains an infernal
potion, which, without destrying life, shutters the brain,
and creases maddening fancies. It will well serve my pur-
9ee; and I thus thee, Satan, for the gift.''

ABOUT.
TE COMMON.
Not two months after this occurrence, and near mid-
night, a young man was hurrying along Pall-mall, with a
look of the wildest despair, when his headlong course was
suddenly arrested by a strong grasp, while a familiar voice
sounded in his ear.
ee It is useless to meditate self-destruction, Mardol Dear,''
cried the person who had checked him.  If you find life a
burden, I can make it tolerable to you.''
turning round at the appeal, Mardol beheld a tall man,
wrapped in a long black cloak, whose sinister features were
well known to him.
 Leave me, Rougemont 1'' he cried, fiercely.  I want
no society-above all, not yours. You know very well that
you have ruined me, and that nothing more is to be got
from me. Leave me, I say, or I may do you a mischief,''
 Tut, tut, Mardol, I am your friend1' replied Rouge-
mont.  I purpose to relieve your distress.''
4 Will you give me back the money you have won from
me1'' cried Mardol.  Will you pay my inexorable are-
its1 Will you see me from s prison 7''
 I will do all this, and more,'' replied Rougemont. I
will make you one of the richest men in London.''
THE CONTACT.
133
Spare your insnlting jests, sir,'' cried Mardol. Am
in no mood to bear them,''
 I am not jesting,'' rejoined Rougemont.  Come with
me, and you shall be convinced of my sincerity.''
Mardol at length assented, and they turned into Saint
James's-square, and paused before a magnificent hose
Rougemont ascended the steps. Mardol, who had come-
pained him almost mechanically, gazed at him with asto-
moment.
 Do you live here'' he inquired.
Ask no questions,'' replied Rougemont, knocking at
the door, which was instantly opened by a hall porter,
while other servants in rich liveries appeared at a distance.
tougemont addressed a few words in an under tone to
them, and they instantly bowed respectfully to Burial,
while the foremost of them led the way up a magnificent
staircase.
ALl this was a mystery to the young man, but he followed
his conductor without a word, and was presently nshered
p P s9freely-furnished and brilliantly-illuminated,]
apartment.
The servant then left them; and as soon as he was gone
Mardol exclaimed-` Is it to mock me that you have brought
me hither 2
 To mock you-no,'' replied Rougemont. I have told
you that I mean to make you rich. But you look greatly
exhausted. A glass of wine will revive you,''
And as he spoke, he stepped towards a small cabinet,
and took from it a curiously-shaped bottle and a goblet.
13A
ARIOL.
 Taste this wine-it has been long in one family,'' he
added, filling the cup.
t It is as strange, bewildering drink,'' cried Mardol, set-
thing down the empty goblet, and passing his hand before
his eyes.
 You have taken it upon an empty stomach-that is
all,'' said Rougemout.  You will be better noon.''
I feel as if I were going mad,'' cried Mardol.  It is
some damnable potion you have given me.''
 Ha1 hal'' laughed Rougemont.  It reminds you of
the elixir you once quffed-eh 7'"
tA truce to this gallery I' cried Animal, angrily. i
have said I am in no mood to bear it 
 Pshaw 1 I mean no offence,'' rejoined whether, change-
in his manner. e WHat think you of this house ?''
That it is magnificent,'' replied Mardol, gazing around.
I envy you its possession.''
te It shall be yours, if you please,'' replied Rougemont.
 MIne you are mocking me again.''
Not in the least. You shall by it from me, if you
please.''
At what price?'' asked Mardol, bitterly.
At a price you can easily any,'' replied the other.
 Come this way, and we will conclude the bargain.''
Proceeding towards the farther end of the room, they
entered a small exquisitely-furnished chamber, surrounded
with eofas of the most luxurions description. In the midst
was a table, on which writing materials were placed.
4 It were a fruitless boon to give you this house without

the door. `THis pocket-book will furnish on with them.''
4 Notes to an immense amount 1'' cried Mardol, opening
the pocket-book, and glancing at its contents.
 They are yours, together with the house,'' cried Rouge-
mont, `` if you will but sign a compact with me,''
A compact 1I'' cried Mardol, regarding him with a look
of undefinable terror. Who, and what are you 7''
ee Some men would call me the deill'' replied Range-
mont, carelessly.  But you know me too well to suppose
that I meritsueh a designation. I offer you wealth. What
more could you require ?"
4 But upon what terms 7'' demanded Mardol.
e The easiest imaginable,'' replied the other. e You
shall judge for yourself
And as he spoke, he opened a writing-desk upon the
table, and took from it a parchment.
sIt down,'' he added; '` and red this.''
Mardol complied, and as he scanned the writing he be-
came transfixed with fear and astonishment, while the
pocket-book dropped from his grasp.
After a while, he looked up at Rongemont, who was
leaning over his shoulder, and else features were wrinkled
with a derisive smile.
Then you are the Find7'' he cried.
If you will have it so-certainly,'' replied the other.
eYon are Satan in the form of the man i once knew,''
cried Mardol. tAaunt1 I will have no dealings with
you.''

 I thought you wiser than to indulge in such idle fears,

notion of me to be correct, why need you be alarmed 
You are immortal,''
et True,'' rejoined Mardol, thoughtfully; `' bat yet-''
 Phaw 1'' rejoined the other, ` sign, and have done
with the matter,''
By this compact I am bound to deliver a victim-a
female victim -- whenever you shall require it,'' cried
Mardol.
 Precisely,'' replied the other; `you can have no stiff-
could in fulfilling that condition.''
e But if I fail in doing so, I am doomed--''
But you will not fail,'' interrupted the other, lighting a
taper, and sealing the parchment. " Now sign it''
Mardol mechanically took the pen, and gazed fixedly on
the movement.
I shall bring eternal destruction on myself if I sign it,''
Ee muttered.
A stroke of the pen will rescue you from utter ruin,''
said Rougemont, leaning over his shoulder. Riches and
happiness are yours. You will not have such another
chance.''
Tempter 1'' cried Mardol, hastily attaching his signaturo
to the paper. But he instantly started back aghast at the
friends laugh that rang in his ears.
I repent-give it me back f'' he cried, endeavouring to
snatch the parchment, which Rougemont thrust into his]
bosom.

137
e It is too late l'' cried the latter, in a triumphant tone.
4 You are mine-irredeemably mine.''
sEa 1'' exclaimed Mardol, sinking back on the couch.
i leave you in possession of your house,'' pursued
Rougemont; "` but I shall return in a week, when I shall
require my first victim.''
 Your first victim1 oh, Heaven I'' exclaimed Mardol.
`Ay, and my choice falls on Edith About I'' replied
Rougemont.
e Edith TalbotI'' exclaimed Mardol;  she your victim i
Think you I would resign her I love better than life to
you 2''
It is because she loves you that I have chosen her,''
rejoined Rougemont, with a bitter laugh. :" And such will
ever be the case with you. Seek not to love again, for
our passion will be fatal to the object of it. When the
week has elapsed, I shall require Edith at your hands. TIll
then, farewell l'
 Stay 1' cried Mardol. I break the bargain with thee,
fiend. I will have none of it. I abjure thee.''
And he rushed wildly after Rougemont, who had already
gained the larger chamber; but, ere he could reach him,
the mysterious individual had passed through the outer
door, and when Mardol emerged upon the gallery, he was
nowhere to be seen.
Several servants immediately answered the frantic
hours of the young man, and informed him that Mr,
Rougemont had quitted the house some moments age,

telling them that their master was perfectly satisfied with
the arrangements he had made for him.
And we hope nothing has occurred to alter your opinion,
it1'' said the hall porter.
ee You are sure Mr. Rougemont is gone 7'' cried
Mardol.
Ol, quite sure, sir,'' cried the hall porter, I held
him on with his cloak, myself. He said he should return
this day week.''
If he comes I will not see him,'' cried Mardol, sharply;
"mind that. Deny me to him; and on no account what-
her let him enter the house,''
e Your orders shall be strictly obeyed,'' replied the porter.

4e Now leave me,'' cried Mardol.
And as they quitted him, he added, in a tone and with a
gesture of the deepest despair, '`All directions are useless.
I am indeed lost I
InnEsoLUTION.
III.
IN8OLTION.
139
O returning to the cnbinet, where his fatal compact
with Rongemont had been signed, Mardol perceived the
pocket-book lying on the floor near the table, and, taking
it up, he was about to deposit it in the writing-desk, when
an irresistible impulse prompted him once more to examine
its contents. UNfolding the roll of notes, he counted
them, and found they amounted to more than a hundred
thousand pounds. The sight of so much wealth, and the
thought of the pleasure and the power it would procure
him, gradually dispellel his fears, and arising in a trains-
port of delight, he exclaimed- es, yes-all obstacles
are now removed When Mr. Tualhot finds I am become
this wealthy, he will no longer refuse me his daughter.
But I am mad,'' he added, sullenly checking himself
--'' worse than mad, to indulge such loves. If it be
indeed the Fiend to whom I have sold myself, I have no
help from perdition1 If it be man, I am scarcely less
terribly fettered. In either case, I will not remain here
longer; nor will I avail myself of this accursed money,
which has tempted me to my undoing.''
And, hurling the pocket-book to the farther end of the
room, he was about to pass through the door, when a
140
TABLE.

mocking laugh arrested him. He looked round with
astonishment and dread, but could see no one. After
while, he again moved forward, but as voice, which he.
recognised as that of Rongemont, called upon him to
stay.
e It will be in vain to fly,'' said the unseen speaker.
 You cannot escape me. Whether you remain here or
::EEEEEG
not-whether you use the wealth I hae given you, or
this knowledge, you are at liberty to go. But, remember,
on the seventh night from this I shall require Edith Almost
from you 1'
 Where are you, fiend 7'' demanded Mardol, gazing
around, furiously. `' Show yourself, that I may confront
you.''
A mocking laugh was the only response deigned to this
injunetion.
 Give me back the compsct,'' cried Mardol, imploringly.
" It was sighed in ignorance. I knew not the price I was]
to pay for your assistance. Wealth is of no value to me.
without Edith.''
 Without wealth you could not obtain her,'' replied the
voice. `' You are only, therefore, where you were. But
you will think better of the bargain to-morrow Meanwhile,
I counsel you to place the money you have so unwisely cast
from you safely under lock and key, and to seek repose.
You will awaken with very different thoughts in the
morning.''

RESOLUTION.
141
4 How am I to account for my sudden accession of
wealth 1'' inquired Mardol, after a pause.
 On a gambler, and ask that question l'' returned tha
unseen stranger, with a bitter laugh.  But I will make
your mind easy on that score. As regards the house, you
will find as regular conveyance of it within that writing-
desk, while the note lying on the table, which bears your
address, comes from me, and announces the payment of a
hundred and twenty thousand pounds to you, as a debt of
honour. You see I have provided against every difficulty.
And now, farewell t''
The voice was then hushed; and though Mardol al-
dressed several other questions to the unseen speaker, no
answer was returned him.
After some moments of irresolution, Mardol once more
took up the pocket-book, and deposited it in the writing-
desk, in which he found, as he had been led to expect, a
deed conveying the house to him. He then opened the
note lying upon the table, and found its contents accordled
with what had just been told him. Placing it with the
pocket-book, he locked the writing-desk, exclaiming, `` It
is useless to struggle further-I must yield to fate1''
THis done, he went into the adjoining room, and, casting
his eyes about, remarked the antique bottle and flagon.
The latter was filled to the one-how or with what, Mardol
paused not to examine; but seizing the cup with despair-
lion, he placed it to his lips, and emptied it at a draught
A species of intoxication, but pleasing as that produced

by opium, presently succeeded. ALl his fears left him, and
in their place the gentlest and most delicious fancies arose.
Surrendering himself delightedly to their influence, he sank
upon a couch, and for some time was rapped in a dreamy
elysium, imagining himself wandering with Edith About
in a lovely garden, redolent of sweets, and vocal with the
melody of Birds. Their path led through as grove, in the
midst of which was a fountain; and they were hastening
towards its marble brink, when all at once Edith uttered
a scream, and, starting back, pointed to a large black snake
lying before her, and upon which she would have trodden
the next moment. Mardol sprang forward and tried to
crush the reptilo with his heel; but, aoiling the blow, it
coiled around lis leg, and plunged its venom teeth into
his flesh. The anguish occasioned by the imaginary wound
roused him from his slumber, and looking up, ho perceived
that a servant was in attendance.
Bowing obsequiously, the man inquired whether he had
occasion for anything.
4 Show me to my bedroom-that is all I require,'' replied
Mardol, scarcely able to shake off the effect of the vision.
And, getting up, ho followed the man, almost meet-
calmly, out of the room.
EDITH ABOUT.
In.
143
It was late when Mardol rose on the following morning.
At first, finding himself in a large and most laxuriantly-
furnished chamber, he was at a loss to conceive how he
came there, and it was some time before he could fully recall
the mysterious events of the previous night. As had been
foretold, however, by ougemont, his position did not answer
him so much anxiety as before,
After stirring himself, he descended to the lower apart-
meets, in one of which s impetuous breakfast awaited him;
and having partakes of it, he took a complete survey of
the house, and found it larger and more magnificent even
than he had supposed it. He next supplied himself From
the pocket-book with a certain sum, for which he fancied
he might have occasion in the course of the day, and sallied
forth. His first business was to proceed a splendid carriage
and horses, and to order some new and rich hasbiliments to
be made with the utmost expedition.
He then proceeded towards May Fair, and knocked at
the door of a large house at the upper end of Curzon-street.
His heart beat violently as he was shown into an elegant
drawing-room, and his trepilation momentarily increased,
until the servant reappeared and expressed his regret that
he had misinformned him in stating that Miss About was

144

at home. Both she and Mr. ITalbot, he said, had gone out
about half an hour ago. Dauris looked incredulous, but,
without making any remark, departed HUrrying home,
he wrote a few lines to Mr. About, announcing the sudden
and extraordinary change in his fortune, and formally de-
minding the hand of Edith. He was about to despatch
this letter, when a note was brought him by his servant.
It was from Edith. Having ascertained his new address
from his card, she wrote to assure him of her constant at-
attachment. Transnorted by this proof of her affection,
Mardol half devoured the note with kisses, and instantly
sent off his own letter to her father-merely adding a few
words to say that he would call for an answer on the
morrow. But he had not to wait thus long for a reply.
Ere an hour had elapsed, Mr. Almost brought it in
person.
Mr. About was a man of about sixty-tall, thin, and
gentleman-like in deportment, with grey hair, and black
eyebrows, which lent considerable expression to the orbs
beneath them. His complexion was a bilions brown, and
he possessed none of the good looks which in his daughter
had so captiated Mardol, and which it is to be prcsumed,
therefore, she inherited from her mother.
A thorough man of the world, though not an unamiabl
person, Mr. About was entirely influenced by selfish con-
siderutions. He had hitherto looked with an untfaourable
eye upon Mardol's attentions to his daughter, from a notion
that the connexion would be very undesirable in a pecuniary
point of view; but the magnificence of the house in Saint
EDITH ABOUT.
145
James's-square, which fully bore not Mardol's account of
his newly-acquired wealth, wrought a complete change in
his opinions, and he soon gave the young man to under-
stand that he should be delighted to have him for a son-
in-la. Finding him so favourable disposed, Mardol en-
treated him to let the marriage take place-within three
days, if possible.
Mr. About was greatly grieved that he could not comply
with his young friend's request, but he was obliged to
start the next morning for Nottingham, and could not
possibly return under three days.
 But we can be married before you go'' cried Mardol.
 Scarcely, I fear,'' replied Mr. Almost, smiling blandly.
e You must control your impatience, my dear young friend.
On the sixth day from this-that is, on Wednesday in next
week-we are now at Friday-you shall be made happy.''
The coincidence between this appointment, and the time
fixed by Rougemont for the deliver of his victim, struck
Mardol forcibly. His emotion, however, escaped Mr. About,
who soon after departed, having engaged his future son-in-
law to dine with him at seen o'clock.
Mardol, it need scarcely be said, was punctual to the hour,
or, rather, ho anticipated it. He found Edith alone in the
drawing-room, and seated near the window, which was filled
with choieest flowers. On seeing him, she uttered an ex-
exclamation of joy, and sprang to meet him. The young
man pressed his lips ferrently to the little hand extended
to him.
Edith About was a lovely brunette. Her features were re-
1406
VIOL.
clear, and her eyes, which were perfectly splendid, were dark,
almond-shaped, and of almost Oriental languor. Her hair
which she wore braided over her brow and gathered behind
in a massive roll, was black and glossy as a rain's wing.
Her cheeks were dimpled, her lips of velvet softness, and
her teeth like rages of pearls. Perfect grace accompanied
all her movements, and one only wondered that feet so
mall as those she possessed should hae the power of us-
gaining a form which, though lightsome, was yet rounded
in its proportions.
e You have heard, dear Edith, that your father has con-
sent to our union 1'' said Mardol, after going at her for
a few moments in silent admiration.
Edith murmured an affirmative, and blushed deeply.
 He has fixed Welnesday nest,'' pursued Mardol ; `` but
I wish an earlier day could have been named. I have a
presentiment that if our marriage is so long delayed, it will
not take place at all,''
 You are full of misgivings, Mardol,'' she replied.
 I confess it,'' he said; `` and my apprehension hae
risen to such a point, that I feel disposed to urge you to a
private marriage, during your father's absence.''
e Oh, no, Burial; much as I lore you, I could never
consent to such a step,'' she cried. 4 You cannot urge me
to il. I would not abuse my dear father'se trusting love.
-I had nor deceived him, and that is the best assurance
I can give you that I shall never deceive you.''
Further conversation was interrupted by the entrance
EDITH ABOUT.
147
of Mr, About, who held out both his hands to Mardol,
and professed the greatest delight to see him. And no
doubt he was sincere. The dinner passed off most plea-
saintly, and so did the evening; for the old gentleman was
in high spirits, and his hilarity was communicated to the
young couple. When Mardol and Mr. ITalbot went up-
stairs to teas, they found that Edith's aunt, Mrs. Maitlanl,
had carried to take charge of her during her father's a-
sence. This lady had always exhibited a partiality for
Mardol, and had encouraged his suit to her niece; conse-
quietly she was well satisfied with the turn affairs had
taken. It was near midnight before Mardol could tear
himself away; and when he rose to depart, Mr. About,
who had yawned frequently, but fruitless, to gie him
hint, told him he might depend upon seeing him back on
the evening of the third day, and in the mean time he
committed him to the care of Mrs. Maitland and Edith.
THree days flew by rapidly and delightfully; and on the
evening of the last, just as the little party were assembled
in the drawing-room, after dinner, Mr. About returned
from his journey.
 Well, here I am 1'' he cried, clasping Edith to his
bosom, `` without having encountered any misadventure.
On the contrary, lI hae completed my business to my
entire satisfaction.''
Oh, how delighted I am to see you, dear papa l'' ex-
claimed Edith,. e Now, Mardol, you can have no more a-
prehensions I'"

AUBIOL.
`Apprehension of what t'' cried Mr. About.
e Of some accident falling you, which might have in-
interfere with our happiness, sir,'' replied Ariol.
Oh, lovers are all of idle fears'' cried Mr. About.
 They are unreasonable beings. However, here I am, as
I said before, safe and sound. To-morrow we will finish all
preliminary arrangements, and the day after you shall be
made happy-hal he1'
 Do you know, papa, Mardol intend to give a grand
ball on one wedding-day, and has invited all his aoquaint-
ance to it7 remarked Edith.
I hope you have not invited Cyprian Rongemont7'
said Mr. About, regarding him fixedly.
 I have not, sir,'' replied Mardol, turning pale. But
why do you particulars him 2
 Because I have heard some things of him not much to
his credit,'' replied Mr. About.
 What-what have you herd, sir7'' demanded Mardol.
 Why, one shouldn't believe all the ill one hears of
man; and, indeed, I cannot believe all I have heard of
Cprian Rougemont,'' replied Mr. About; `' but I should
be glad if you dropped his acquaintance altogether. And
now let us change the subject.''
Mr. About seated himself beside Mrs. Maitland, and]
began to give her some fact of his journey, which a-
feared to have been as pleasant as it had been rapid.
Unable to shake off the gloom which had stolen over him,
Mardol took his leave, promising to meet Mr. About at his]

149
lawyer's in Lincoln's Inn, at noon on the following day.
Ha was there at the time appointed, and, to Mr. About'a
great delight, and the no small surprise of the lawyer, paid
over a hundred thousand ponds, to be settled on his future
wife.
 You are a perfect man of honour, Mardol,'' said Mr.
About, clapping him on the shoulder, `` and I hope Edith
will make you an excellent wife. Indeed, I have no doubt
of it'
he Nor I,--if I ever possess her,'' mentally ejaculatod
Mardol.
The morning passed in other preparations. In the
evening the lovers met as usual, and separated with the
full persuasion, on Edith's part at least, that the next day
would make them happy. Since the night of the compass,
Mardol had neither seen Iougemont, nor heard from him,
and he neglected no precaution to prevent his intrusion.
--
150
DAURIS.
It was a delicious morning in May, and the sun shone
brightly on Mardol's gorgeous equipage, as he door to St.
George's, Answer-square, where he was united to Edith.
Thus far all seemed auspicious, and he thought he could
now bid defiance to fate. With the object of his love close
beside him, and linked to him by the strongest and holiest
ties, it seemed impossible she could be snatched from
him. Nothing occurred during the morning to give him
uneasiness, and he gave orders that a carriage and four
should be ready an hour before midnight, to convey him and
his bride to Richmond, where they were to spend their
honeymoon.
Night came, and with it began to arrive the guests who
were bidden to the ball. No expense had been spared by
Mardol to give splendour to his fete. It was in all respects
magnificent. The amusements of the evening commenced
with a concert, which was performed by the first singers
from the iTalian Opera; after which, the ball was opened
by Mardol and his lovely bride. As soon as the dance was
over, Mardol made a sign to an attendant, who instantly
disappeared.
 Are you prepared to quit this gay scene with me,
Edith 7'' he asked, with a heart swelling with rapture.

TIME SEVENTH NIGHT.

 Quite so,'' she replied, gazing at him with tenderness;
 I long to be alone with you.''
t Come, then,'' said Mardol.
Edith arose, and passing her arm under that of her his-
and, they quitted the ball-room, but in place of descending
the principal staircase, they took a more private course.
The hall, which they were obliged to cross, and which they
entered from a side-door, was spacious and beautifully pro-
portion, and adorned with numerous statnes on pedestals,
The ceiling was decorated with fresco paintings, and sup-
parted by two stately scagliola pillars. From between these,
a broad staircase of white marble ascended to the upper
room. As Mardol had foreseen, the staircase was thronged
with guests ascending to the ball-room, the doors of which
being open, afforded glimpses of the dancers, and use forth
strains of liveliest music. Anxious to avoid a newly-arrived
party in the hall, Mardol and his bride lingered for a no-
ment near a pillar.
Ha1 who is this'' cried Edith, as a tall man, with a
sinister countenance, and habited entirely in black, moved
from the farther side of the pillar, and planted himself in
their path, with his back partly towards them.
A thrill of apprehension passed through Mardol's frame.
He looked up and beheld Rougemont, who, glancing over
his shoulder, fixed his malignant gaze upon him. Retreat
was now impossible.,
 You thought to delude me,'' said Rongemont, in a
deep whisper, audible only to Dauris; ``but you counted
without your host. I am come to claim my victim,''

But her husband retained no answer. Terror had taken
away his power of utterance.
Far aariags wish for you at the door, madam-al

taking her hand.
' Yo are going, Auriolt' cried Edith, who scarcely
knew whether to draw back or go forward.
 Yes-yes,'' cried Mardol, who fancied he saw s means
of escape. :THis is my friend, Mr. Rongemont-go with]
him.''
` Mr. Rougenont,'' cried With.  you told my father.
he would not be here''
Your husband did not invite me, madam,'' said Range-
on, with resisted emphasis: ' but knowing I should be
welcome, I came nnasked. But let us aid those persons.''
In another moment they were at the door. The carriage
was there with its four horses, and a man-servant, in mrs-]
telling attire, stood beside the steps. Reassured by the]
sight, Mardol recovered his courage, and suffered Rouge-]
mont to throw a cloak or Edith's shoulders. The next]
moment she tripped up the steps of the carriage, and was]
ensconced within it. Mardol was about to follow her, when]
he received a violent blow on the chest, which stretched]
him on the pavement. Before he could regain his feet,]
Rongemont had sprung into the carriage. The steps were]
instantly put up by the man-servant, who mounted the box]
with the utmost celerity, while the postilions, plunging]

spurs into their horses, dashed off with lightning speed.
As the carriage turned the corner of King-street, Mardol,
who had just arisen, beheld, by the light of a lamp,
Rougemont's face at the window of the carriage, charged
with an expression of the most friends triumph.
 What is the matter'' cried Mr. About, who had a-
preached Mardol. :I came to bid you good-by. Why do
I find you here alone1 Where is the carriage l-what has
become of Edith 1
 She is in the power of the Fiend, and I have sold her
to him,'' replied Mardol, gloomily.
 What mean you, wretch f'' cried Mr, About, in a voice
of distraetion. :'I heard that Cyprian Rougemont was]
here. Can it be he that has gone off with her 1''

M. TonxcnorT and his companions had scarcely
gained s passage in the deserted house, which they had
entered in the manner described in a previous chapter,
when they were alarmed by the sudden and furious ringing
of a bell overhead. The noise brought them instantly to
a half, and each man grasped his arms in expectation of an
attack, but the peal ceasing in a few moments, and all on-
tinuiug quiet, they moved on as before, and presently
reached s large hall with a lofty window over the door,
which, being without shutters, afforded light enough to
reveal the dilapidated condition of the mansion.
From this hall four side doors opened, apparently come-
indicating with different chambers, three of which were
cautiously tried by Weeks, but they proved to be fastened.
The fourth, however, yielded to is touch, and admitted
them to a chamber, which seemed to have been recently
occupied, for a lamp was burning within it. The walls
were panelled with dusky oak, and hung at the lower end

with tspestry, representing the Syrian monareh Ninns,
and lis captive Zoroaster, ing of the Bactrians. Tha
chief furniture consisted of three large high-backed and
grotesquely-carved arm-chairs, near one of which stood a
powerful electrical machine. squares and circles were
traced upon the floor, and here and there were scattered
cups and balls, and other matters apparently belonging to
a conjuring apparatns.
The room might be the retreat of a man of science, or it
might be the depositary of s juggler. But whoever its
occupant was, and whatsoever his pursnits, the good things
of the world were not altogether neglected by him, as was
proud by a table spread with viands, and furnished with
glasses, together with a couple of taper-necked bottles.
While glancing upwards, MIr. Thorneyeroft remarked that
just above each chair the ceiling was pierced with a round
hole, the meaning of which he could not at the time come-
pretend, though after circumstances sufficiently explained
it to him.
4 A singular room,'' he observed to Weeks, on concluding
his surrey. Did you expect to find any one here ?'"
I hardly know,'' replied the other. That bell may
have given the alarm. But I will soon ascertain the point
Remain here till I return.''

croft, easily.

no harm will befal you. Whatever you may hear without,
do not stir,''
 What are we likely to hear '' asked Thorneycroft, with
increasing trepidation.
THat's impossible to say,'' answered Weeks; '`but I
warn you not to cry out unnecessarily, as such an proud-
dance would danger our safety.''
 You are quite sure you don't mean to abandon us t''
persisted Thorneyceroft.
t Make yourself bessy; I have no such intention,'' re-
joined Weeks, sternly.
Oh1 i'll take care of you, don't be afeerd, old gent,''
said Ginger.
e Yes, ve'll take care on yo,'' added tha Tinker and the
Brandon.
 You may depend upon them as upon me, sir,'' said
Weeks. : Before we explore the subterranean apartments,
I wish to see whether any one is up-stairs,''

Bat without paying any attention to the inquiry, Reek
quitted the room, and closed the door carefully after him.
Ho next crossed the hall, and cautiously ascending a stair-
case at the farther end of it, reached the landing-place.
Beyond it was a gallery, from which several chambers
opened.

Advancing a few paces, he listened intently, and hearing
a slight sound in an apartment to the right, he stepped
softly towards it, and placing his eye to the keyhole, beheld
s tall man, dressed i black, pacing to and fro with rapid
strides, while three other persons, wrapped in table gowns,
and disguised with hideous masks, stood silent and motion-
less at a little distance from him. In the tall man he
recognised Cyprian Rongemont. Upon a table in the
middle of the room was laid a large open volume, bound in
black vellum. Near it stood a lamp, which served to ill-
mine the scene.
]-
Suddenly, Rougemont stopped, and turning over several
leaves of the book, which were covered with cabalistio
characters, appeared in search of some magic formula.
Before he could find it, however, a startling interruption
occurred. An alarm-bell, fixed against the wall, began
to ring, and at the same moment the doors of a cabinet
flew open, and a large are (for such it seemed to Weeks),
clothed in a woollen shirt and drawers, sprang forth, and
bounding upon the table beside Rougemont, placed its
mouth to his ear. The communication thus strangely made
seemed highly displeasing to Rongemont, who knitted his
brown, and delivered some instructions in an under tone to
the monkey. The animal nodded its head in token of
obedience, jumped off the table, and bonded back to the
cabinet, the doors of which closed as before. Rougemont
next took up the lamp, with the evident intention of quit-

158
thing the room, seeing which, Weeks hastily retreated to an
adjoining chamber, the door of which was fortunately open,
and had scarcely gained its shelter when the for mystery-
on personages appeared on the gallery. Weeks heard
their footsteps descending the staircase, and then, creeping
cautiously after them, watched them across the hall, and
pause before the chamber containing Mr. Thorneycroft and
his companions. After a moments' deliberation, Rouge-
mont noiselessly locked the door, took out the key, and
leaning two of his attendants on guard, returned with the
third towards the staircase.
Without tsrrying to confront them, Weeks started back,
and hurried along the gallery till he came to s back stair-
case, which conducted him, by various descent, to the base-
ment floor, where, after traersing one or two vanlts, he
entered a subterranean passage, arched overhead, and having
several openings at the sides, apparently communicating
with other passages. It was lighted at intervals by lamps,
which emitted a feeble radiance.
By the light of one of these, Weeks discovered the door
of a cell. It was of iron, and as he struck with his hand,
returned a hollow clangour. On repeating the blow, a
hoarse voice from within cried, ` Leave me in peace l'
Is it Mardol Day who speaks 7'' demanded Weeks.
It is,' replied the prisoner. Who are you that put the
question 7''

4 you are mistaken,'' rejoined Weeks.  I have come]
with Mr. Thomnereroft to deliver you.'
Mr. Thorneycroft has come too late. He has lost his
daughter,' replied Mardol.
 What has happened to her ?'' demanded Weeks.
 She is in the power of the Fiend,'' replied Mardol.
tI know she is detained by Cprian Rougemont,'' said
were. BUt what has befallen her ?
She has become like his other victims-like my
victims I' cried Mardol, distractedly.
Do not despair,'' rejoined Weeks. :She may yet be
said.''
 Said1 how t'' cried Dauris.  All is over.''
 So it may seem to you,'' rejoined Weeks; ``but you
are the victim of delusion,''
Oh that I could think sol'' exclaimed Mardol. 4Be
no-I saw her fall into the pit. I beheld her veiled figure
rise from it. I witnessed her signatare to the fatal seroll.
There could be no illusion in what I then beheld,''
 Despite all this, you will see her again,'' said Weeks.
 Who are you who gie me this promise ?'' asked Mardol.
As I have already declared, a friend,'' replied Weeks.
' Are you human 7''
t As yourself,''
 Then you seek in vain to struggle with the powers of
darkness,'' said Mardol.
160

with a long.

Mon than ten minutes had elapsed since Weeks's de-
pasture, and Mr. Thorneycroft, who had hitherto had some
difficulty in repressing his anger, now began to give vent
to it in muttered threats and complaints. His impatience
was shared by the Tinker, who, stepping p to Ginger,
said--

the chair opposite Thorneyeroft.  If Weeks don't come back

towards the table on which the provisions were spread;

There can be but one opinion as to your nefurious pro-
passion,'' said Mr. Thorneycroft, ``and that is, that it's as
bad as horse-stealing and sheep-stealing, and should be
punished as those offences are vanished.''
So I think, sir,'' said Ginger, winking at the others;
: but to my story, and don't interrupt me, or I can get
through with it properly. There's a gent living' not
hundred miles from Pall-Mall, as the newspapers says, as
had a favourite Scotch terrier, not worth more nor half-as-
crown to any one but hisself, but highly wallerablo to him,
cns it was a favourite. Tell, the dog is lost. A pale of
mine gets hold on it, and the gent soon offers a reward for
its recovery. This don't bring it back quite so soon as he
expects, 'cost he don't offer enough; so he goes to an agent,
Mr. Simpkias, in the Edge-road, and Mr. Simpkins says
to him-says he, How are you, sir2 I expected you some
days ago. You've come'd about that ere Scotch terrier.
You've got a syllable greyhound, I understand. A man
told me he'd hae that afore long.' Seen' the gent
stare, Mr. S. adds,  Ve, Ll tell you not you must gie

He knows it ain't worth six shillin', but it's a great
favourite, and has given him a precious sight o' trouble in
gettin' it.'  Give him trouble' cries the gent, angrily-
'and what has it given me I hope to see the rascal

plies Mr. Simpkins, coolly, `then your d'l1 be blamed
death, as the nobleman's was, and thrown down a breathless
carkis afore your door.''"
 You don't mean to say that such a horrid circumstance
as that really took place2'' cried Thorneyeroft, who was
much interested in the relation.
 Only t'other day, I assure you,'' replied Ginger.
 d shoot the ruffian who treated a dog of mine so, if I
cannot in1' cried Mr. Thorneyeroft, indignantly.
And save him right, too,'' said Ginger. : I discern-
rages all cruelty to animals. But don't interrupt me
again. After a bit more chafferin' with Mr. Simpkins, the
gent offers three pound for his dog, and then goes away.
Next day he reads a report i' the Times newspaper that a
man has been taken up for dog-stealing', and that a lot o'
dogs is shut up in the green-yard behind the police-office
in Bow-street. So he goes there in search of' his favourite,
and sure enough he finds it, but the spectator on't give it
up to him, 'es the superintendent is out of' the day.''
Shameful'' friend Mr. Thorneyeroft.
e Shameful, indeed, sir,'' echoed Ginger, laughing.
 Thinkin' his dog safe enough in the hands of' the police,
the gent sleeps soundly that night, but even he goes back

has been broken into overnight, and all the dogs stolen

comes the cream o' the jest. You shall hear wot the beak
says to him even the gent craves his assistance.`I can't

a majestic manner. `Parties don't ought to come here

 I do, indeed,'' said Thorneyeroft, sighing; ``and I am
sorry to think such n remark should have dropped from the

You're right to say dropped from it, sir,'' laughed
Ginger.
 I told you the beasts vis our best friends; they always
takes on parts. Even the gent urges that it was a subject
of her'as importance to all dog-owners, the magistrate
angrily interrupts him, saying'-- Then let there be a

could, 'cost he's the dog-fancies's friend.''

to m quite satisfied with the present state of the law,'
said Ginger; ``here's the worthy beak1 I'l drink his
health a second time.''
ee Shall1 wot's that7'' cried the Tinker; ' I thought I
heard a noise,''
te So did I,'' rejoined the Scandal; `'a strange sort o'
rumblin' sound overhead.''
e There it goes again l'' cried Ginger; ` wot an awful
din 1
e Now it'a underneath,'' said Mr. Thorneycroft, turning
pale, and trembling.  It sounds as if some hidden ms-
chinery were at work.''
The noise, which up to this moment had borne an indis-
tinct resemblance to the creaking of wheels and pulled, now
increased to a violent clatter, while the house was shaken as
if by the explosion of a mine beneath it.
At the same time, the occupant of the chairs received
a sharp electrical shock, that agitated every limb, and
caused Mr. Thorneyeroft to let fall lis pistol, which went
off as it reached the ground. At the same time, the Sand-
man dropped his goblet, and the Tinker relinquished his
grasp of the class. Before they could recover from the
shock, all three were caught by stout woolen hooks, which,
detaching themselves from the back of the chairs, pinioned
their arms, while their legs were restrained by fetters, which
sprang from the ground and clasped round their ankles.
Thus fixed, they struggled vainly to get free. The chairs
168

seemed nailed to the ground, so that all efforts to move
them proved futile.
But the worst was to come. From the holes in the cell-
ing already alluded to, descended three hey bell-shaped
helmnets, fashioned like those worn by divers at the bottom
of the sea, and having round feeble-holes of glass. It was
evident, from the manner of their descent, that the
helmets must drop on the head of the sisters-a convic-
lion that filled them with inexpressible terror. They shouted,
and swore frightfully ; but their vociferations availed them
nothing.  Down came the helmet, and the same moment,
the monkey which had been seen by Weeks issued from a
cupboard at the top of a cabinet, and grinned and gibbered
at them.
Down came the first helmet, and covered the Tinker to
the shoulders. His appearance was at once ludicrous and
terrible, and his roaring within the casque sounded like tha
following of s waited bull.
Down came the second helmet, though rather more slowly,
and the Scandal was eclipsed in the same manner as the
Tnker, and roared as loudly.

In both these instances the helmets had dropped without
guidance, but in the case of Mr. Thorneyeroft, a hand,
thrust out of the hole in the ceiling, held the helmet us-
ended over his head, like the sword of Dramless. While]
the poor iron-merchant momentarily expected the same]

doom as his companions, his attention was attracted
towards the monkey, which, clinging with one hand to the
side of the cabinet, extended the other asking arm towards
him, and exclaimed--t Will you swear to go hence if you
are spared 7''
%No, I will not,'' replied the iron-merchant. He had
scarcely spoken, when the helmet fell with a jerk, and ex-
tinguished him like the others.
Ginger alone remained. During the whole of this strange
scene, he had stood with the bottle in hand, transfixed
with terror and astonishment, and wholly unable to me
or cry out. A climax was put to his fright, by the descent
of the three chairs, with their occupants, through the floor
into a vault beneath; and as the helmets were whisked up
again to the ceiling, and the trap-doors closed upon the
chairs, he dropped the bottle, and fell with his face upon
the table. He was, however, soon roused by a pull at his
hair, while a shrill voice called him by his name.
 Who is it1'' groaned the dog-fancies.
 Look up l'' cried the speaker, again plucking his hair.
Ginger complied, and beheld the monkey seated beside
him.
 By, it can't be, surely,'' he cried. `And yet I could
almost swear it was Old Par,''

laugh,  It is your venerable friend.''

Oh, leave them to their fate,'' replied Old Pair.
tO, that'll never do,'' cried Ginger.  e're all in the
same boat, and must row on together the best ay ve can.
I tell you not it is, venerable,'' he added, seizing him by
the throat-'`your master may be the devil, but you're
mortal; and if you don't help me to deliver my companions,
All squeege your windpipe for you.''

Part, twisting himself like an eel out of the other's ripe.
Now get out, if you can.''
Don't be angry,'' cried Ginger, seeing the mistake la
had committed, and trying to conciliate him; ` I only meant
to frighten you a bit. Can you tell me if MIr, Mardol Day
is here 2'
e Yes, he is, and a close prisoner,'' replies Old Pair.
'And the girl-Miss Ebber, wot of her 1''
I can't say,'' rejoined Old Pair. "I can only speak to
the living.'

e That's a secret,'' replied the dwarf, mysteriously; `and
To bound by a terrible oath not to disclose it.''

Ginger. I wish you would lend me a knock on the

Old Part, in a tannting tone. `` But come with me, and

RoUnd the chair, in which Mr. Thorneyeroft is fixed,
reached the ground, terror had taken away his senses. A
bottle of salts, placed to his nose, revived him after a time;
but he had nearly relapsed into insensibility on seeing to
strange figures, in hideous mssks and snble cloaks, stand-
ing on either side of him, while at a little distance was a
third, who carried a strangely-fashioned lantern. He looked
round for his companions in misfortune, but, though the
chairs were there, they were unoccupied.
The asked attendants paid no attention to the iron-
merchant's cries and entreaties; but as soon as they thought
him able to me, they touched a spring, which freed his
arms and legs from their bondage, and rising him, dragged
him out of the vault, and along a narrow passage, till they
came to a large spulchral-looking chamber, essed with
black marble, in the midst of which, on a velvet fauteuil of
the same hue as the walls, sat Oyprian Rongemont. It

was, in fact, the chamber where Ebba had been subject to
her terrible trial.

Bewildered with terror, the poor in-merchant threw
himself at the feet of Rongemont, who, eyeing him with a
look of malignant triumph, cried,
 Yo have come to seek your daughter. Behold
her 1
And at the words, the large black curtains at the farther
end of the room were suddenly withdrawn, and discovered
the figure of Ebba Thorneyeroft. standing at the foot of the
marble staircase. Her features were as pale as death; her
limbs rigid and motionless; but her eyes blazed with prefer-
natural light. On beholding her, MIr. Thorneyeroft uttered
a loud cry, and, springing to his feet, would hae rushed
towards her, but he was held back by the two asked
attendants, who seized each arm, and detained him by main
force.

But she appeared wholly insensible to his cries, and re-

Mr, Thorneyeroft.
Still the figure remained immovrable.

a taunting tone; `` but she is beyond your reach.''

And, stretching out his hand, the curtains slowly de-]
scented, and shrouded the figure from view.
Thorneyecroft ground aloud.

I will liberty you and your companions.''
 So far from complying with your request, I swear never

And, followed by the attendants, who dragged Mr.
Thorneycroft after him, he plunged into an opening on the]
right. A few steps brought him to the entrance of the
well. Touching the heavy iron door, it instantly swung
open, and disclosed Mardol chained to a stone at the farther
corner of the narrow chamber.
Not a word was spoken for some minutes, but the steps]
regarded each other piteously.
ee Oh, Mr. Thorneyeroft,'' cried Angrily, t length, I
beseech you forgive me. I have destroyed your daughter.''

 It is true,'' said Rougemont.
I would have saved her if it had been possible' cried
Mardol. I warned her that to love me would be fatal to
her. I told her I was linked to an inexorable destiny,
which would involve her in its meshes-but in vain.''

 You see you ought to blame him, not to,'' said Rouge-
mont, with a derisie lang.

Rougemont, ` fled-whatever you are, complete your
work of ruin by my destruction. I have nothing left to

with a diabolical laugh.  It is only the happy I seek to
destroy. But you have to thank your own obstinacy for
your present distress. Bid a lasting farewell to Burial.

``Ay, hold'' echoed a loud and imperious voice, from
the depths of the passage.

passing over his countenance.

e I, Gerard Paston 1'' exclaimed Weeks, stepping for-
ward.
The crape was gone from his brow, and in its place was
seen the handsome and resolute features of a man of middle
life. He held as pistol in either hand.
 Is it you, Gerard Paston7'' cried Mardol, regarding
him;  the brother of Lady, my second victim 1'
 It is,'' replied the other.  Your delierance is at
hand, Mardol.''
 And you have dared to penetrate here, Gerard 7'
tried Rougemont, standing the ground with rage. F Re
collect, you are bond to me by the same ties as Mardol,
and you shall share his fate.''
 I am not to be intimidated by threats,'' replied Paston,
with a scornful laugh. A Son hae employed your arts
too long. Deliver up Mardol and this gentleman at once,
or---'' And he levelled the pistols at him.
 Fre I' cried Rougemont, drawing himself up to his
towering height.  No earthly ballets can injure me.''
 e'll try that'' cried Ginger, coming up at the
moment behind Paston.
And he discharged s pistol, with a deliberate aim, at the
breast of Rougemont. The latter remained erect, and
apparently nninjured.
 You see how ineffectnual your weapons are,'' said
Rongemont, with a derisive lang.

e It must be the devil '' red Ginger running off.
I will try mine,'' said Paston.
But before he could draw the triggers, the pistols were
rested from his grasp by the two attendants, who had
quitted Thorneycroft, and stolen upon him perceived, and
who next pinioned his arms.
IV.
So bewildered was the poor iron-merchant by the strange
and terrible events that had befallen him, that, though
released by the two asked attendants, who left him, as
before related, to seize Gerard Paston, he felt utterly
incapable of exertion, and would probably have made no
effort to regain his freedom, if his coat had not been
vigoronsly placed behind, while a low voice urged him to
fly. Glancing in the direction of the friendly speaker, he
could just discern a diminutive object standing within tha
entrance of a side-passage, and reared up against the wall
so as to be out of sight of Rougemont and his attendants.
It was the monkey-or rather Old Pair-who, continuing
to rug violently at his coat, at last succeeded in drawing
him backwards into the passage, and then grasping his
hand tightly, hurried him along it. THe passage was
179
wholly nnlighted, boat Mr. Thorneyeroft would receive that
it was exceedingly circuitous, and winded round likes
 Where are you taking met'' he inquired, attempting
to stop.
`` Ask no questions,'' rejoined the dwarf, pulling him
along.  Do you want to be captured, and shut up in a
cell for the rest of your life 7"
 Certainly not'' replied Thorneyeroft, aecelerating his
movements; ' I hope there's no changes of it''
 There's every chance of it,'' rejoined Old Pair.  If
your taken, you'll share Ariol's fate.''
te Oh, Lord1 I hope not,'' groaned the iron-merchant.
 I declare, you frighten me so much that you take away
all power of movement. I shall drop in a minute.''
 Come along, I say,'' screamed the dwarf.  I hear
them close behind us.''
And as he spoke, shouts, and the noise of rapidly-
approaching footsteps, resounded along the passage.
 I can't stir another step,'' gasped the iron-merchant
 To completely done. Better yield at once.''
 What, without a struggle'' period the dwarf, tannt-
ingly.  Think of your daughter, and let the thought of
her nerve your heart. She is lost for ever, if you don't
get out of this accursed place,''
e She is lost for her as it is,'' cried the iron-merchant
despairingly.

4 No-she may yet be saved,'' rejoined the dwarf.
 Come on-come on-they are close behind us.''
And it was evident, from the increased solomon, that
their pursuers were upon them.
Roused by the imminent of the danger, and by the
hope of rescuing his daughter, Mr. Thorneycroft exerted all
his energies, and sprang forward. A little farther on, they
were stopped by a door. It was closed; and venting his
disappointment in a scream, the dwarf searched for the
handle, but could not find it.
 Wo are entrapped-we shall be caught,'' he cried,
t and then woe to both of us. Fool that I was to attempt
your preservation. Better I had left you to not in a dun-
geon than have incurred Rongemont's displeasure.''
The iron-merchant replied by a groan.
 It's all her with me,'' he said. `I give it up--TIll
die here I''
e No-we are saved,'' cried the dwarf, as the light, now
flashing strongly upon the door, reeled a small iron
button within it,-'` saved-said I"
As he spoke, o pressed against the bntton, which
met a spring, and the door flew open. Just as they
passed through it, the to asked attendants came in
sight. The dwarf instantly shut the door, and finding
a bolt on the side next him, shot it into the pocket.
Scarcely had he accomplished this, when the purer

finding it bolted, presently ceased their efforts, and papa-
gently withdrew.

cried Old Pair, who had paused for a moment to listen;

it more difficult to get out than I did to get in. How this

the dwarf, coming to s halt.  I could almost fancy that
the solid stone walls were moving around us.''
 They are moving,'' cried Thorneycroft, stretching out
his hand. I feel 'em. Lord has mercy upon us, and
deliver us from the power of the Evil One''
The place seems on fire,'' cried the dwarf. :A thick
smoke fills the passage. Don't you perceive it, Mr.
Thorneyeroft 2
eeDon't I.--to be sure I do,'' cried the iron-merchant,
coughing and meeting. e I feel as if I were in a room
with a smoky chimney, and no window open. Oh1-oh

his ease.  e shall soon be out of the smoke.'"

minute,'' rejoined Old Pair. ` Hallos1 how's this No

4Dead stop, indeed 1'' echoed the iron-merchant. We've
come to that long ago. But what new difficulty has
arisen 7"

e N-o-o-not I,'' gasped the iron-merchant.  Im
suffocating-help to drag me to.''
Get out if you can,'' cried the voice that had just
spoken.
 It'a Rougemont himself,'' cried the dwarf, in alarm.
Then there's no escape.''
None whatever, rascal,'' replied the unseen speaker.
4I want you. I had more work for you to do.''
I won't leave MIr. Thorneyeroft,'' cried the dwarf,
resolutely.  The promised to preserve him, and Ill keep
my word.''
ee Fool I'' cried the other.  You must obey when I
command,''
And as the words were uttered, a hand was thrust down
from above, which, grasping the dwarf by the name of the
neck, drew him upward.
" Lay hold of me, Mr. Thorneyeroft,'' screamed Old
Pair.  Im going p again-lay hold of me-pall go]
down.''
Well-nigh stifled by the thinking and pungent
vapour, the poor iron-merchant found eompliance impos-
sible. Before he could reach the dwarf, the little fellow was

carried off. Loft to himself, Mr. Thorneyeroft staggered
along the passage, expecting every moment to drop, until
at length a current of fresh air blew in his face, and
enabled him to breathe more freely. Somewhat revived,
did so, for he suddenly arrived at the brink of a pit about
eight feet in depth, into which, if he had approached
it incantionsly, he must infallibly have stumbled, and in all
probability hae broken his neck. This pit evidently come-

by s brazen lamp burning under an archway. A ladder
was planted at one side, and by this Mr. Thorneycroft
descended, but scarcely had he set foot on the ground,
. than he felt himself rudely grasped by a man who stepped
from under the archway. The next moment, however, he
was released, while the familiar voice of the Tinker ex-
claimed,

Yes, it's me, certainly, Mr. Tinker,'' replied the iron-
merchant. 4wHo's that you're got with you ?''

he kicked and pushed against the door, but all is efforts
were unavailing to burst it open.
At the same time the Brandon rushed towards the
ladder, but before he could monnt it all egress by that
means was cut off. An immense iron cover worked in a
groom was pushed by some unseen mnchinery over the top
of the pit, and enclosed them in it.
For several hours deep sleep, occasioned by some potent
medicaments, had bond up the senses of Mardol. On
awaking, he found himself within as cell, the walls, the floor,
and the ceiling of which were of solid stone masonry. In
the midst of this chamber, and supporting the ponderous
roof, stood a massive grsnite pillar, tha capital of which
was grotesquely ornamented with death's-heads and cross-
bones, and against this pillar leaned Mardol, with his left
arm chained by heavy links of iron to a ring in the doing-
ing wall. Beside it stood a pitcher of water, and near
him lay an antique-looking hook, bound in black vellum.
The dungeon in which he was confined was circular in form,
with a loved roof, sustained by the pillar before mentioned,

and was approached by a steep flight of steps rising from
a doorway, placed some six feet below the level of the
chamber, and surmounted by a pointed arch. A stream of
light, descending from a narrow aperture in the roof, fell
upon his wasted and haggard features. His dark brown
hair hung about his face in elf-locks, his beard was un-
trimmed, and a fixed and stony grown like that of insanity
sat in his eye. He was seated on the ground-neither
bench nor stool being allowed him-with his hand support-
ing his chin. His gaze was fixed upon vacancy-if that
can be called vacsney, which to him was filled with vivid
images. His garb was not that of modern times, but con-
sister of a double and those of rich material, wrought in
the fashion of Elizabeth's days.
After remaining for some time in this musing attitude,
Mardol opened the old time before him, and began to turn
over its leaves. It was full of magical disquisitions and
mysterious characters, and he found insoribed on one of its
earlier pages a name which instantly riveted his attention.
HAving vainly sought some explanation of this name in the
after contents of the book, ho laid it aside, and become lost
in meditation. His receive ended, ho heaved a deep sigh,
and turned again to the open volume lying before him, and

arm to examine his sleeve more narrowly. satisfied that
he was not deceived, he arose and examined himself from

head to foot. He found himself, as has been stated, attired
in the garb of a gentleman of Elizabeth's time.
e What can this mean 7'' he cried.  Have I endured
long and troubled dream, during which I have fancied my-
]self living through more than two centuries7 Oh, Heaven,
that it may be sol Oh, that the fearful crimes I suppose
I have committed have only been enacted in a dream Of,
]that my victims are imaginary Oh, that Ebba should
only prove a lovely phantom of the night And yet, I
could almost wish the rest were real-so that she might
exist. I cannot bear to think that she is nothing more
than a vision. But it must be so-I have been dreaming
--and what a dream it has been a-what strange glimpses
it has afforded me into maturity1 Methought I lived in
the reigns of many soereigns-beheld one of them carried
to the block-saw reolutions convulse the kingdom-old
dynasties shaken down, and new ones spring up. Fashions
seems to me to have so changed, that I had clean forgotten
the old ones; while my fellow-men scarcely appeared the
same as heretofore. Can I be the same myself2 Is this
the dress I once wore2 Let me seek for some proof''
And thrusting his hand into his double, he drew forth
one tablets, and hastily examined them. They bore his
name, and contained some writing, and he exclaimed alone
with joy, ` This is proof enough-I have been dreaming
all this while.'

The scheme works to a miracle,'' muttered s personage
stationed at the foot of the steps springing from the door-
ay. and who, though concealed from view himself, was
watching the prisoner with a malignant and exulting gaze.
e And yet, why am I here 7'' pursued Mardol, looking
around. " Ah1 I see how it is,'' he added, with a shudder;
4I had been mad-perhaps am mad still. That will
account for the strange delusion under which I have
laboured.''
I will let upon that hint,'' muttered the listener.
 Of what use is memory,'' continued Ariol, musingly,
 if things that are not, seem as if they were If joys and
sorrows which we have never endured are stamped upon the
brain-if visions of scenes, and faces and events which we
have never witnessed, never known, haunt us, as if they had
once been familiar7 But I am mad-mad I'
The listener laughed to himself.
 How else, if I were not mad, could I have believed that
I had swallowed the fable elixir vile1 And yet, is ita
fable? for I am puzzled still. Methinks I am old-old-
old-though I feel young, and look young. All this is
madness. Yet how clear and distinct it seems1 I can call

such a king1 The reigning sovereign should be James,

CoULD.
There was another pause, during which the listener in-
lulled in a suppressed fit of laughter.
 Would I could look forth from this dungeon,'' pursued
Mardol, again breaking silence, ``and satisfy myself of the
truth or falsehood of my doubts by a view of the external
world, for I am so perplexed in mind, that if I were not
distracted already, they would be enough to drive me so.
What dismal, terrible fancies have possessed me, and weigh

lips-whether I signed a compact with the Fiend, and de-
liked him a victim on each tenth year-I cannot now
know; but if it is so, I deeply, bitterly regret them, and
would oxpiate my offences by a life of penance.''
It this moment Rougemont, attired in a dress similar to
that of the prisoner, marched up the stops, and cried,

with astonishment; ` in what age I am living; and
whether I am in my right mind or not7''

Rougemont; `'for the second, you are living in the reign of

And casting a sinister glance at his captive, he turned
upon his heel, descended the steps, and quitted the cell.

became impatient for the appearance of his keeper, but hour
after hour passed and he did not arrive. Worn out, at
length, with doubt and bewildering speculations, the miss-
table captive was beset with the desire to put an end to his
torments by suicide, and he determined to execute his fell
purpose without delay. An evil chance seemed also to he-
friend him, for scarcely was the idea formed, than his foot
encountered something on the ground, the rattling of which
attracted his attention, and stooping to take it up, he
grasped the bare blade of a knife.

aloud. tI ill sheathe this weapon in my heart, and, if I

full intent to strike, but before he could inflict the slightest
wound, his arm was forcibly arrested.
 Would you destroy yourself, madman 1' ronred a
voice. I thought your violence was abated, and that you
might go forth in safety. But I find you are worse than
ever.''
Mardol uttered a groan and let the knife fall to the ground.
The new comer kicked it to a distance with his foot.
e You shall be removed to another chamber,'' he pursued,
t where you can be more strictly watched.''
 Take me forth-oh I take me forth,'' cried Mardol. eeIt
was a mere impulse of desperation, which I now repent.''
I dare not trust you. You will commit some act of
insane fury, for which I myself shall have to bear the
blame. When I yielded to your entreaties on a former
occasion, and took you forth, I narrowly prevented you
from doing all we met a mischief.''
I have no recollection of any such circumstance,''
returned Mardol, mournfully. But it may be true, never-
endless. And if so, it only provres the lamentable condition
to which I am reduced-memory and reason gone''
' Ay, both gone,'' cried the other, with an irrepressible
chuckle.
 Ha 1'' exclaimed Mardol, starting. I am not so mad
but I recognise in you the Evil Being who tempted me.
I am not so oblivious as to forget our terrible interviaws.''
 What, you are in your lines again'' cried Rougemont,

fiercely.  Nay, then I must call my assistants, and bind]
you.''
Let me be-let me be t'' implored Mardol, `` and I will
offend you no more. Whatever thoughts my arise within]
me, I will not give utterance to them. Only take me
forth.''

repeat, I dare not. You are not sufficiently master of
yonrsalft.'
tRy to,' said Angrily.
 Well,'' rejoined the other, ``I will see what I can doto
calm you.''
So saying, he disappeared for a few moments, and then
returning with as torch, placed it on the ground, and pro-
during a child, handed it to the captive.
 Drink :' he said.
Without a moment's hesitation Mardol compliad.
It seems to me rather a stimulant than a soothing
potion,'' he remarked, after emptying the child.
You are in no condition to judge,'' rejoined the other.
And he proceeded to unfasten Mardol's chain.
Now then, come with me,'' he said, ``' and do not make
any attempt at evasion, or you will are it''
Like one in a dream, Mardol followed his conduetor down
the flight of stone steps leading from the dungeon, and
long a narrow passage. As he proceeded, he thought he

heard stealthy footsteps behind him; but he never turned
his head, to see whether he was really followed. In this
way they reached a short steep staircase, and, mounting it,
entered a vault, in which Rougemont paused, and placed
the torch he had brought with him upon the poor. Its
lurid glimmer partially illumined the chamber, and showed
that it was built of stone. Rude benches of antique form
were set about the vault, and poisoning Mardol to be seated
upon one of them, Rougemont sounded a silver whistle.
The summons was shortly afterwards answered by the
dwarf, in whose attire as new change had taken place. He
was now clothed in a jerkin of grey serge, fashioned like
the garments worn by the common people in Elizabeth'a
reign, and wore a trencher-cap on his head. Mardol
watched him as he timidly advanced towards Rlougemont,
and had an indistinct recollection of having seen him
before; but could not call to mind how or where.
Is your master a-bed 3'' demanded Rougemont.
A-bed1 Good lack, girl'' exclaimed the dwarf, `Little
of sleep knows Dr. Lamb. He will toil at the furnace till
the stars have set,''
e Dr. Lamb l'' repeated Mardol.  Surely I have heard
that name before 2'"
 Very likely,'' replied Rougemont, ``for it is the name
borne by your nearest kinsman.''

glancing commiseratingly at Mardol.  My master often
makes inquiries after his grandson, and grievres that the
state of his mind should render it necessary to confide
him.''
His grandson1 I-Dr. Lamb's grandson 1'' cried
Mardol.
 In south are you, young sir,'' returned the dwarf.
4 Were you in your reason, you would be aware that my
master's name is the same as your own-Day-Reginald
Day. He assumes the name of Doctor Lamb to delude
the multitude. He told you as much yourself, sweet sir, if
your poor wits would enable you to recollect it,''
Am I in a dream, good fellow, tell me that1' tried
Mardol, lost in amazement.
`Black, no, sir,'' replied the dwarf; 'to my thinking,
you are wide awake. But you know, sir,'' he added,
touching his forehead, `` you have been a little wrong here,
and your memory and reason are not of the clearest.''
 Where does my grandsire dwell '' asked Mardol.
 why here, sir,'' replied the dwarf; '' and for the matter
of loeality, the house is situated on the south end of
London-bridge.'
 On the bridge-did you say on the bridge, friend7'
cried Mardol.
'Ay, on the bridge-where else should it but You
would not have your grandsire lie under the river 2''

197
rejoined the dwarf; `` though, for ought I know, some of
these vaults may go under it. They are damp enough.''
Mardol was lost in reflection, and did not observe a sign
that passed between the dwarf and Rougemont.
IiI it disturb Dr. Lamb if his grandson goes up to
him 1'' said the latter, after a brief pause.
 My master does not like to be interrupted in his opera-
tions, as you know, sir,'' replied the dwarf, `` and seldom
suffers any one, except myself, to enter his laboratory; but
I will make so bold as to introduce Master Mardol, if he
desires it'
 You will enter the greatest favour on me by doing
so,'' cried Mardol, rising.
 Sit down-sit down I'' said Rougemont, suthoritativrely.
 You cannot go up till the doctor has been apprised. Re-
main here, while Flapdragon and I ascertain his with.''
So saying, he quitted the chamber by a farther outlet with
the dwarf.
During the short time that Mardol was left alone, he
found it vain to attempt to settle his thoughts, or to con-
since himself that he was not labouring under some strange
delusion.
He was abroad at length by the dwarf, who returned
alone.
 Your grandsire will see you,'' said the mankind.
 One word before we go,'' cried Mardol, seizing his arm.

4 You must keep composed, or I dare not take you to my
master,''
e Pardon me,'' replied Ariol; `I ment not to alarm
yo. Where is the person who brought me hither 2
 What, your keeper 2'' said the dwarf.  Oh, he is
within call. He will come to you anon. Now follow
me.''
And taking up the torch, he led the way out of the
chamber. Monnting a spiral staircase, apparently within
a turret, they came to a door, which being opened by Flap-
dragon, disclosed a scene that well-nigh stupefied Mardol.
It was the laboratory precisely as he had seen it aboa
two centuries ago. The floor was strewn with alchemieal
implemente-the table was covered with mystic parchments
inscribed with cabalistic characters-the furnace stood in
the corner-crucibles and cucurbites decorated the chimney-
board--the sphere and brazen lamp hung from the ceiling-
the skoletons grinned from behind the chimney-corner-all
as there as he had seen it before There also was Doctor
Not, in his loose gown of about silk, with a square black
case upon his venerable head, and his snowy beard streaming
to his girdle.
The old man's gaze was fixed upon a crucible placed
upon the furnace, and he was occupied in working the
fellows. Ho moved his hand as Mardol entered the chamber,

and the features became visible. It was a face never to be
forgotten.
e Come in, grandson,'' said the old man, kindly. ' Come
in, and close the door after you. The draught affects the
furnace-my Author, as we adepts term it. o you are
better, your keeper tells me--much better.''
 Are you indeed living'' cried Mardol, rushing wildly
towards him, and attempting to take his hand.
 Of,-off' cried the old man, drawing back as if
alarmed. Yo disturb my operations. Keep him clem,
Flapdrasgon, or take him hence. He may do me a mischief.''
e I have no such intention, sir,'' said Animal;  indeed
I have not. I only wish to be asked that you are my
aged relative.''
4 To be sure he is, young sir,'' interposed the dwarf.
s Why should you doubt it1
e Oh 1 sir,'' cried Mardol, throwing himself at the old
man's feet, ``pity me if I am mad; but offer me some
explanation, which may tend to restore me to my senses.
My reason seems gone, yet I appear capable of receiving
impressions from external objects. I see you, and appear
to know yo. I see this chamber-these alchemical simple-
bents-that furnace-these different objects-and I appear
to recognise them. Am I deceived, or is this real 7'"

you have suffered from fever, and what visions your delirium
was produced. When you are perfectly restored, we will
talk the matter over,.''
And, as he said this, he began to blow the fire anew,
and watched with great apparent interest the changing
]colours of the liquid in the cucurbite placed on the furnace.
Animal looked at him earnestly, but could not catch
another glance, so intently was the old man occupied. At
length he ventured to break the silence.
 I should feel perfectly convinced, if I might look forth
from that window,'' he said.
 Convinced of what'' rejoined the old man, somewhat
sharply.
e That I am what I seem,'' replied Mardol.
 Look forth, then,'' said the old man. 4 But do not
disturb me by idle talk. There is the rosy colour in the
projection for which I have been so long waiting.''
Mardol then walked to the window and gazed through th
.ltinted panes. It was very dark, and objects could only to

imperfeetly distinguished. Still he fancied he could detect
the gleam of the river beneath him, and what seemed a
long line of houses on the bridge. He also fancied he
discerned other buildings, with the high roofs, the gables,
and the other architectural peculiarities of the structures
of Elizabeth's time. He persuaded himself, also, that he

could distinguish through the gloom the venerable Gothi
pile of Saint Paul'a Cathedral on the other side of the
water, and, as if to satisfy him that he was right, s deep
solemn bell tolled forth the hour of two. After a while he
returned from the window, and said to his supposed grand-
sire, `I am satisfied. I have lived centuries in a few
nights.''

Sir Alone Flamstead. I have called it a dining-room, from
its ordinary application to the purposes of reflection and
festivity; but it had much more the air of a library, or
study. It was a small comfortable chamber, just large
enough to contain half a dozen people, though by manage-
ment double that number had been occasionally squeezed
into its narrow limits. The walls were decorated with
curious old prints, maps and plans, set in old black worm-
eaten frames, and representing divers personages, places,
and structures connected with London and its history.

Over the mantelpiece was stretched Vertne's copy of
alph Agnes's famous survey of our ``great metropolis,''
made about the beginning of Elizabeth's reign, or perhaps
a little earlier, when it was scarcely so great a metropolis
as at the present time, and when novelists, gentlemen of the
press, cabmen, omnibus cats, and other illustrious per-
stones were unborn and undreamced of; when St., Gives's,
in lieu of its mysterious and Dealing Seven Dials (which

rounded by a grove of elms; when a treated wall girded
in the City, from Palate to Grey Friars; when a pack of

of hay-carts and hay-stacks at the other; when the Thames
was crossed by a single bridge, and that bridge looked like
a street, and the street itself like a row of palaces. On the
right of this plan hung a sketch of WIll Somers, jester to
Henry VIII., after the picture by Holding; on the left an
engraving of Geoffrey Undone, the diminutive attendant at
Henriettas Maria. This niche was devoted to portraits of
the bluff king before mentioned, and his six spouses; that
to the melancholy Charles and his family. Here, the Great
Fire of 1666, with its black profiles of houses, relieved by
a sheet of '` bloody and malicious'' flame, formed as pleasant
contrast to the icy wonders of the Frost Fair, held on the
THames in 1684, when carriages were driven through the
lines of tents, and an ox was roasted on the water, to the
infinite delineation of the citizens. There Old Saint Paul'a
(in the words of Victor Hugo, `' one of those Gothic monu-
meets so admirable and so irreparable''), and which is but
ill replaced by the modern ``' bastard connterpart'' of the
glorious face of St. Peter at Rome, reared its venerable
tower (not come) and lofty spire to the sky. Next to St.
Paul's came the reverend Abbey of Westminster, taken
before it had been disfigured by the towers added by Wren;
and next to the abbey opened the long and gathered vista of
its magnificent neighbouring hall. Several plans and
prospects of the Tower of London, as it appeared at
different epoehs, occupied a corner to themselves: then
came a long array of taverns, from the Board in Month-

Adjoining these places of entertainment were others of

Shakspeare (how insafferable is Mr. Night's orthography
of this roverend name-Shakspere) trod the stage; the
king's play-house in Charles the Second's time; the Bear-

tions rose before you, as you gazed around. Scarcely an
old edifice, to which an historical tradition could be attached
(and what old London edifics is destitute of such traditions7),
was wanting. Nor were the great of old--the spirits, who
gave interest and endurance to these decayed, or decaying
structures, wanting. But I shall not pause to enumerate
their portrait, or make out a catalogue as long as the list
of Home's slips, or the gallery of Mr. Lodge. Sufficient
has been said, I trust, to give the reader an idea of th
physiology of the room. Yet stay1 I must not omit ta
point on the contents of those groaning shelves. In the
goodly folios crowded there are contained the chronicles of
Polished and Hall; of Grafton, Faint, and Show; of
Mayhew of Paris, and his namesake of Westminster. Let
him not be terrified at the ponderous size of these sdmirable
old historians, nor be deterred by the black letter, if he
hold chance to open a volume. Their freshness and pick-
treasure details will surprise as much as they will delight
him. From this wealthy mine Shakspeare drew some of his
purest ore. The shelves are crowned by a solitary bust. It
is that of a modern. It is that of a lover of London, and
a character of London. It is Across ones.
Having completed the survey of the apartment, I shall
now proceed to its occupants. These were fie in number

bowl, must not pass mentioned. They were in the full
low of fun and conviviality; enjoying themselves as good
follows always enjoy themselves at `'` the season of the year.''
The port was delectable-old as Saint Paul's, I was going
to say-not quite, however-but just `` old enough;'' the
claret was nectar, or, what is better, it was Little; to
punch was drink for the gods. The jokes of this party
would hae split your sides--their laughter would have had
the sense effect on your ears. Never were heard peals of
merriment so hearty and prolonged. You only wondered
low they found time to drink, so quick did each roar follow
on the heels of its predecessor. That they did drink, how-
ever, was clear; that they had drunk was equally certain;
and that they intended to continue drinking seemed to come
within the limits of probability.
Sir Alone Flamstead was a retired merchant-one of
those high-souled, high-principles traders, of whom our
City was one so justly proud, and of whom so few, in these
days of railway bubbles, and other harebrained special-
tions, can be found. His word was his bond-once passed,
it was sufficient; his acceptance were acoounted safe as
the Bank of England. Had Sir Thomas Greslam descended
from his niche he could not have been treated with greater
consideration than attended if Linley's appearance on
'Change. All eyes followed the movements of his tall and
stately figure-all hats were raised to his courteous but
eceremonious salutation. Affable, yet precise, and tinetnrel

with something of the punctilionsness of the old school, his
manners won him universal respect and regard, even from
those unknown to him. By his intimates he was revered.
His habits were as regular as cloekwork, and the glass of
cold punch at Tom's, or the basin of soup at Birch's, wound
him up for the day. His attire was as formal as his
manners, being a slight modification of the prealent
costume of some fie-and-thirty years ago. He had con-
seated, not without extreme reluctance, to clothe his nether
limbs in the unmentionable garment of recent introduction;
but he resolutely adhered to the capital. There is some-
thing, by-the-by, in a pitiful, to which old gentlemen cling
in spite of all remonstrance, with lover-like pertinacity.
Only hint the propriety of cutting it off to your great-uncle
or your grandfather, and you may rely on being cut off with
a shilling yourself. Be this as it may, Sir Alone gathered
his locks, once table as the riband that bound them, but
now thickly strewn with the silver  blossoms of the grave,'
into a knot, and suffered them to dangled a few inches below
his collar. His shoes shone with a lustre beyond French
polish, and his hat was brushed till not a wind dared to a-
preach it. Sir Alone wore a white, unstarched cravat, with
a thick had in it, sported a fill over his waistcoat, carried
a black ebony cane in his hand, and was generally followed
by s pet p-dog, one of the most spacious and disagree-
able specimens of his species. Sir Alone Flamstead, I have
said, was all-I might have said he was very tall-some-

what narrower across the shoulders than about the hips-a
circumstance which did not materially conduce to his
symmetry-with grey, benevrolent eyes, shaded by bnshy,
intelligent brows-a lofty, expansive forehead, in which,
in the jargon of phreuology, the organs of locality and
ideality were strongly developed, and which was rendered
the more remarkable from the flesh having fallen in on
either side of the temples-with a nose which had been
considered handsome and well proportioned in his youth,
but to which good living had imparted a bottle form and a
bottle tint-and cheeks from which all encroachments of
whiskers was sedulonsly removed, in order, we conclude,
that his rosy complexion might be traced from its point of
concentration, upon the prominent feature before mentioned,
to its final disappearance behind his ears. Such was Sir
Alone Flamstead.

ness all the pomp and splendour displayed at this high
solemnity-to gaze down that glittering pile, and mark the
various ecclesiastical dignitaries, were in their peculiar and]
characteristic costume, employed in the ministration of their
sacred functions, and surrounded by a wide semicircle of the
papa guards, so stationed to keep back the crowd, and
who, with their showy scarlet attire and tall chambers,
looked like the martial figures we see in the sketches of
Cloth. Nor was the brilliant effect of this picture dim-
wished by the impetuous framework in which it was set.
Overhead flamed a roof resplcndent with burnished gold;
before me rose a canopy supported by pillars of porphyry,
and shining with many-coloured stones; while on either
hand were chapels devoted to some noble house, and boast-
ing each the marble memories of a pope. Melodious masses
proper to the service were ever and anon chanted by the
papa choir, and overpowering perfume was diffused around
by a hundred censers.
Subdued by the odours, the music, and the spectacle, I
sank into a state of dreamy enthusiasm, during a continue-
ance of which I almost fancied myself a convert to the faith
of Rome, and surrendered myself nnreflectingly to an ad-
miration of its errors. As lI gazed among the surrounding
crowd, the sight of so many prostrate figures, all in atti-
tides of deepest devotion, satisfied me of the profound
religious impression of the ceremonial. As elsewhere, this
feeling was not universal; and, as elsewhere, likewise, more

zeal was exhibited by the lower than the higher classes of
society; and I occasionally noted amongst the latter the
glitter of an eye or the flutter of a bosom, not altogether
agitated, I suspect, by holy aspirations. Yet methought,
on the whole, I had never seen such abandonment of soul,
such prostration of spirit, in my own colder clime, and
during the exercise of my own more chastened creed, as
that which in several instances I now beheld; and I almost
envied the poor maiden near me, who, abject upon the
earth, had washed away her sorrows, and perhaps her sins,
in contrite tears.
As such thoughts swept through my mind, I felt a plas-
sure in singling out particular figures and groups which in-
interested me, from their peculiarity of costume, or from
their deotional person. Amongst others, a little to my
left, I remarked a band of mountaineers from Calabria, for
such I judged them to be from their wild and picturesque
garb. Deeply was every individual of this little knot of
peasantry impressed by the ceremonial. Every eye was

humbly cast don; every knee bent; every hand was
either occupied in grasping the little crucifix suspended
from its owner's neck, in telling the beads of his rosary, or
foervently crossed upon his bare and swarthy breast
While gazing upon this group, I chanced upon an indi-
ideal whom I had not hitherto noticed, and who now irre-
possibly attracted my attention. Though a little removed
from the Cualabrian mountaineers, and reclining against the

marble walls of the church, he evidently belonged to the
same company; at least, so his attire seemed to vindicate,
though the noble cast of his countenance was far superior
to that of his comrades. He was an old man, with a face
of the fine antique Roman stamp-a bold outline of promi-
nent nose, rugged and imperious brow, and proudly-cut
chin. His head and chin, as well as his naked breast, were
frosted over with the snowy honours of many winters, and
their hour appearance contrasted strikingly with the tawny
hue of a skin almost as dark and as lustrous as polished
on. Peasant as he was, there was something of grandeur
and majesty in this old man's demeanour and physiognomy.
HIs head declined backwards, to as completely to expose
his long and muscular throat. His arms hung listlessly by
his side; one hand drooped upon the pavement, to other
was placed within his breast: his eyes were closed. The
old man's garb was of the coarsest fabric; he wore little
beyond a flirt, a loose vest, a sort of sheep-skin cloak, and
canvas leggings bound around with leathern things. His
appearance, however, was aboo his condition; he became
his rags as proudly as a prince would have become his
remained robe.
The more I serutinised the rigid lines of this old man's
countenance, the more I became satisfied that many sin-
large, and perhaps not wholly guiltless, events were con-
needed with his history. The rosary was in his hand-tha
cross upon his breast-the beads were untold-the crucifix

nnelasped-no breath of prayer passed his lips. His face
was turned eavenward, but his eyes were closed,-he
dared not open them. Why did he come thither, if he did
not venture to pray Why did he assume a penitential
attitude, if he felt no existence
So absorbed was I in the perusal of the workings of this
old man's countenance, as to be scarcely conscious that the
service of high mass was concluded, and the crowd within
the holy pile fast dispersing. The music was hushed, tha
robed prelates and their train had disappeared, joyous dames
were hastening along the marble aisles to their eqnipages;
all, save a few kneeling figures near the chapels, were de-
parting; and the old man, aware, from the stir and hum
prevailing around, that the ceremonial was at an end, arose,
stretched out his arm to one of his comrades, a youth who
had joined him, and prepared to follow the concourse.
Was he really blind? Assuredly not. Besides, he did
not walk like as one habituated to the direst calamity that
can befall our nature. He staggered in his gait, and reeled
to and fro. Yet wherefore did he not venture to unclose his
eyes within the temple of the Most High7 What would I

I might satisfy my curiosity at once. He was moving
slowly forward, guided by his comrade. In a few seconds
it would be too late-he would have vanished from my
sight. With hasty footsteps I followed him down the]

church, and laid my hand, with some violence, upon his
shoulder.
The old man started at the touch, and turned. Now,
indeed, his eyes were opened wide, and flashing full upon
me,-and such eyes Heretofore I had only dreamed of
such. Age had not quenched their lightning, and I quailed
beneath the fierce glances which he threw upon me. But if
I was, at first, surprised at the display of anger which I had
called forth in him, how much more was I astonished to
behold the whole expression of his countenance suddenly
change. His eyes continued fixed upon mine as if I had
been a basilisk. Apparently ho could not art them;
while his whole frame shivered with emotion. I advanced
towards him; he shrank backwards, and, but for the timely
aid of his companion, would have fallen upon the pale-
Iment.
At a loss to conceive in what way I could have occa-
sinned him so much alarm, I rushed forward to the assist-
ance of the old man, when his son, for such it subsequently
appeared he was, rarely repelled me, and thrust his hand
into his girdle, as if to seek for means to prevent further
interference.

Meanwhile the group had been increased by the arrival
of a third party, attracted by the cry the old man had
uttered in falling. The new comer was an Italian gentle-
man, somewhat stricken in years; of stern and stately de-
portment, and with something sinister and forbidding in his
A NIGHT' ADVENTURE I ROE. 221
aspect. Ho was hastening towards the old man, bat ha
suddenly stopped, and was about to retire when he couldn-
tired my gaze. As our eyes met he started; and a terror,
as sudden and lively as that'exhibited by the old man, was
at once depicted in his features.
My surprise was now beyond all bonds, and I continued
for some moments speechless with astonishment. Not a
little of the inexplicable awe which affected the old man
and the stranger was communicated to myself. Also-
gather, we formed a mysterious and terrible strange, of
which each side bore some strange and unintelligible real-
lion to the other.
The new comer first recovered his composure, though not
without an effort. Coldly turning his heel upon me, he
walked towards the old man, and shook him forcibly. The
latter shrank from his grasp, and endeavoured to void
him; but it was impossible. The stranger whispered a few
words in his ear, of which, from his gestures being directed
towards myself, I could guess the import. The old man
replied. His action in doing so was that of supplication
and despair. The stranger retorted in a wild and vehement
manner, and oeren stamped upon the ground; but the old
man still continued to cling to the knees of his superior.
 Weak, superstitious fool?'' at length exclaimed the
stranger, `' I will waste no more words upon thee. Do, or
say, what then wilt; but beware t1'' And turning him
haughtily back with his foot, he stole away.

222 A MIGHT ADYRE n ROW.
The old man's reverend head struck against the marble
floor. His temple was cut open by the fall, and blood
gushed in torrents from the wound. Recovering himself,
he started to his feet- knife was instantly in his hand,
and he would have pursued and doubtless slain his a-
tigress, if he had not been forcibly withheld by his son,
and by s priest who had joined them.

Again I advanced towards him.

priest; `` but reflect well ere then brings any charge

steps he quitted the church, accompanied by his son.
 Who is that old man 2'' I demanded of the priest.
I am as ignorant as yourself,'' he replied, ``but i
must be looked to; he talks threateningly'' And he
beckoned to an attendant.
e Who was he who struck him1' was my next inquiry.
 One of our wealthiest nobles,'' he replied, `` and an
assured friend of the church. We could ill spare him. Do
not lose sight of them,'' he added to the attendant, `` and
let the spirit track them to their haunts. They must not
be suffered to go forth to-night. A few hours' restraint
will cool their hot Calabrian blood.''

my inquiries.
I must decline further questioning,'' returned the priest,
would. :I have other occupation; and meanwhile it will
be well to have these stains effaced, which may else bring
scandal on these holy walls. You will excuse me, my son.''
So saying, he bowed and retired.
I made fruitless inquiries for the old man at the door of
the church. It was gone; none of the bystanders who
had seen him go forth knew whither.
Stung by curiosity, I wandered amid the most sure-
entered quarters of Rome throughout the day, in the hope
of meeting with the old Calabrian, but in vain. As, how-
her, I entered the court-yard of my hotel, I fancied I dis-

covered, amongst the lounging assemblage gathered round
the door, the dark eyes of the younger mountaineer. In
this I might have been mistaken. No one answering to his
description had been seen near the house.

Of the same night I bent my steps towards the Colos-
seem; and, full of my adventure of the morning, found
myself, not without apprehension, involved within its lady-
writhing passages. Accompanied by a monk, who, with a
small horn lantern in his hand, acted as my guide, I fancied
that, by its uncertain light, I could discover stealthy figures
lurking within the shades of the ruin.
Whatever suspicions I might entertain, I pursued my
course in silence. Emerging from the vomitorio, we stood
upon the steps of the colossal amphitheatre. The huge pile
was bathed in rosy moonlight, and reared itself in serene
majesty before my view.
While indulging in a thousand speculations, occasioned
by the hour and the spot, I suddenly perceived a figure on
a point of the ruin immediately above me. Nothing but
the head was visible; but that was placed in bold relief
-
226  A NIGHT' ADVEYTOE IN ONE.
against the beaming sky of night, and I recognised it at
once. No nobler Roman head had her graced the circus
when Rome was in her zenith. I shouted to the old Call-
brain, for he it was I beheld. Almost ere the sound had
left my lips, he had disappeared. I made known what I
had seen to the monk. He was alarmed-urged our in-
stand departure, and advised me to seek the assistance of
the sentinel stationed at the entrance to the pile. To this
proposal I assented; and, having descended the vast steps
and crossed the open arena, we married, without molesta
lion, at the doorway.
The sentinel had allowed no one to pass him. He he-
turned with me to the circus; and, after an ineffiectual
search amongst the ruins, olunteered his services to a-
company me homewards through the Form. I declined
his offer, and shaped my course towards a lonesome viol
on the right. This was courting danger; but i cared nt,
and walked lowly forward through the deserted place.
Scarcely had I proceeded many paces, when I heard
footsteps swiftly approaching; and, ere I could run round,
my arms were seized from behind, and a bandsge was
passed across my eyes. All my efforts at flirtation were
unavailing; and, after a brief struggle, I remained passive.
MAke no noise,'' said a life which I knew to be that
of the old man, ``and no harm shall befal you. You must
come with us. Ask no questions, but follow.''
I suffered myself to be led, without further opposition,

A MIGHT's ADYENTnE IN ROE. 227
whithersoever they listod. We walked for it might be half
an hour, much beyond the walls of Rome. I had to scrambled
through many ruins, and frequently stumbled her in-
qualities of ground. I now felt the fresh breeze of night
blowing over the wide campagna, and my condactors moved
swiftly onwards as we trod on its elastie turf.
At length they came to a halt. My bandags was he-
moved, and I beheld myself beneath the arch of an aqueduct,
which spanned the moonlit plain. A fire was kindled be-
death the arch, and the ruddy flame licked its walls.
Around the blaze were groped the little band of peasantry
I had beheld within the church, in various and picturesque
attitudes. They greeted my conductors on their arrival, and
glanced inquisitively at me, but did not speak to me. The
older Calabrian, whom they addressed as Cristofano, asked
for a glass of aunt vita, which he handed respeetfully to
me. I declined the offer, but he pressed it upon me.
 You will need it, signor,'' he said; `` you hae much to
go to-night. You fear, perhaps, it is dragged. Behold1'
And he drank it off.
I could not, after this, refuse his pledge.  And now,
signor,'' said the old man, remoing to a little distance
from the group, ``'may I crave a word with you-your
name '"
As I had no reason for withholding it, I told him how I
was called.
 Em1 Hal you no relation of the name of---1

228 A MIGhT's ADEMTFUBE IN ROE.
None whatever.'' And I sighed, for I thought of my
desolate condition.
Strange'' he muttered; adding, with a grim smile,
 but, however, likeness are easily accounted for,''
 hat likeness 2'' I asked. ee Whom do I resemble 7
and what is the motive of your inexplicable conduct 2
e You shall hear,'' he replied, frowning gloomily. Step
side, and let us get within the shade of these arches, out
of the reach of yonder listeners. The tale I had to tell is
for your ears alone.''
I obeyed him; and we stood beneath the shadow of the
nqueduct.
 Years ago,'' began the old man, ` an Englishman, in
all respects resembling yourself, equally well-favoured in
person, and equally young, came to Rome, and took up his
abode within the eternal city. He was of high rank in his
own country, and was treated with the distinction due to
his exalted station here. At that time I dwelt with the
MIarchese di-. I was his confidential servant-his ad-
wiser-his friend. Had lived with his father-carried him
as an infant-sported with him as a boy-loved and served
him as a man. Loved him, I say; for, despite his treat-
ment of me, I loved him then as much as I abhor him now.
Well signor, to my story. If his youth had been proof-
gate, his manhood was not less depraed; it was devoted
to old, calculating libertinism. Soon after he succeeded
to the estates and title of his father, hoe married. That he


A MaRs ADVENTURE IN ROE. 229
loved his bride, I can scarcely believe; for, though he was
wildly jealous of her, he was himself unfaithful, and she
knew it. In Italy, revenge, in such cases, is easily within
a woman's power; and, for aught I know, the marchesa
might have meditated retaliation. My lord, however, took
the alarm, and thought fit to retire to his villa without the
city, and for a time remained seeluded within its walls. It was
at this crisis that the Englishman I have before mentioned
arrived in Rome. My lady, who mingled little with the
gaietios of the city, had not beheld him; but she could not
have been unacquainted with him by report, as every tongue
was loud in his praises. A rumour of his successes with
other dames had reached my lord; nay, I have reason to
believe that he had been startled by the handsome End-
talisman in some other quarter, and he sedulously pre-
vented their meeting. An interview, however, did take
place between them, and in an unexpected manner. It was
the custom then, as now, upon particular occasions, to
drive, during the heats of summer, within the Prizes
Nation, which is flooded with water. One evening to
marchesa drop thither: she was unattended, except by
myself. Our carriage happened to be stationed near that
of the young Englishman,''
 The mnarchesa was beautiful, no doubt '' I said, inter-
rapting him.
 MOst beautiful'' he replied; `' and so your country-
man seemed to think, for he was lost in admiration of her.
230  A NIGHT's ADVENTURE IN ONE.
I am not much erred in the language of the eyes, but his
were too eloquent and expressive not to be understood. I
watched my mistress narrowly. It was evident from her
glowing cheek, though her eyes were cast down, that she
was not insensible to his regards. She turned to play
with her dog, a lovely little greyhound, which was in the
carriage beside her, and pattel it carelessly with the glove
which she held in her hand. The animal snatched the
glove from her grasp, and, as he bounded backwards, fell
over the carriage side. MY lady uttered a scream at the
sight, and I was preparing to extricate the struggling dog,
when the Englishman plunged into the water. In an instant
he had restored her favourite to the marchesa, and received
her warmest acknowledgments. From that moment an in-
intimacy commenced, which was destined to produce the most
fatal consequences to both parties.''
Did you betray them 1'' I asked, somewhat impatiently.
e I was then the blind tool of the marchese. I did so,''
replies the old man. I told him all particulars of the
interview. Ill heard me in silence, but grew ashy pale
with suppressed rage. Bidding me redouble my vigilanee,
he left me. MY lady was now scarcely ever out of my
sight; when one evening, a few days after what had of-
curled, she walked forth alone upon the garden-terrace of
the villa. Her guitar was in her hand, and her favourite
dog by her side. I was at a little distance, but wholly in-
perceived. She struck a few plaintive chords upon her

A NIGIII's ADVENTURE IN ROB. 231
instrument, and then, resting her chin upon her white and
rounded arm, seemed lost in tender reverie. Would you
had seen her, signor, as I beheld her then, or as one other
behold her you would acknowledge that you had never
met with her equal in beauty. Her raven hair fell in thick
tresses her shoulders of dazzling whiteness and the most
perfect proportion. Her deep dark eyes were thrown an-
loudly on the ground, and her radiant features were charged
with an expression of profound and pensive passion.
 In this musing attitude she continued for some minutes,
when she was aroused by the gambolse of her dog, who bore
in his mouth a glove which he had found. As she took it
from him, a letter dropped upon the floor. Had a serpent
glided from its folds, it could not have startled her more.
She gazed upon the paper, offended, but irresolute. Yes,
she was irresolute; and you may conjecture the rest. She
paused, and by that pause was lost. With a shrinking
grasp she stooped to raise the letter. Her cheeks, which
had grown deathly pale, again kindled with blushes as she
perused it. She hesitated-cast a bewildering look towards
the mansion-placed the note within her bosom-and
plunged into the orange-bower.''
 Her lover awaited her there 7'"
 He did. I saw them meet. I heard his frenzied words
--his passionate entreaties. He urged her to fly-she re-
sister. He grew more urgent-more impassioned. She
uttered a faint cry, and I stool before them. The English-

man's hand was at my throat, and his sword at my breast,
with the swiftness of thought; and but for the screams of
my mistress, that instant must have been my last. At her
desire he relinquished his hold of me; but her cries had
reached other ears, and the marehese married to avenge his
injured honour. He paused not to inquire the nature of
the offence, bat, sword in hand, assailed the Englishman,
bidding me remote his Lady. The clash of their steel was
drowned by er shrieks as I bore her away; but I knew
the strife was desperate. Before I gained the house my
lady had fitted; and, committing her to the charge of
other attendants, I returned to the terrace. I met my
master slowly walking homewards. His sword was gone-
his brow was bent-he shunned my sight. I knew what
had happened, and did not approach him. He sought his
wife. What passed in that interview was never disclosed,
but it may be guessed at from its result. That night the
marchesa left her husband's halls-never to return. Next
morn I visited the terrace where she had received the
token. The glow was still upon the ground. I picked it
up and carried it to the marchese, detailing the whole
occurrence to him. He took it, and vowed as he took it
that his vengeance should never rest satisfied till that glow
had been steeped in her blood.''
And he kept his vow 1'' I asked, shuddering.

to blind his ultimate designs. Meanwhile, time rolled on,
and the marchesa gave birth to a child-the offspring of

One night, during the absence of the Englishman, by secret
means we entered the palazzo where the marchesa resided.

chamber. She was sleeping, with her infant by her side.
The sight maddened the marchese. He would have stricken
the child, but I held back his hand. He relented. DIe

which we stood was flooded with moonlight. A glove was
in his hand-it was dripping with blood. His oath was
fulfilled-his vengeance complete-no, not complete, for

 What became of him 7'' I inquired.
t Ask me not,'' replied the old man; `' you were at the
Chimes Santa Maria Maggiore this morning. If those
stones would speak, they might tell a fearful story.''
 And that was the reason you did not dare to unclose

floated between you and heaven.''
The old man shuddered, but replied not.
And the child?'" I asked, after a pause;`" what of
their wretched offspring 7''
It was conveyed to England by a friend of its dead
father. If he were alive, that boy would be about your
age, signor.''
Indeed I'' I said; a horrible suspicion flashing across
my mind.
After the Englishman's death,'' continued Cristofano,
` my master began to treat me with a coldness and sun-
action which increased daily. I was a burden to him, and
he was resolved to rid himself of me. I spared him the

brim, and became-no matter what. Iera I am, Heaven'a

'Ay, justice. You are poor and powerless, but men

who or what you are; but to me you are an instrument of
vengeance, and as such I shall use you. Tha blow dealt
by you will see the work of retribution; and I care not
if you strike twice, and make my heart your second mark.''
Ere I could reply he called to his comrades, and in a few
moments we were speeding across the campagna.
Wo arrived at a high wall : the old man conducted us to
a postern-gate, which he opened. We entered s garden
filled with orange-trees, the perfume of which loaded the
midnight air. We heard the splash of a fountain at a dis-
dance, and the thrilling notes of a nightingale amongst
some taller trees. The moon hung like a lamp over the
belvidere of the proud villa. We strode along a wide her-
race edged by a marble balustrade. The old man pointed
to an open summer-house determining the walk, and gave
me a significant look, but he spoke not. A window thrown

open admitted as to the house. We were within a haIl
crowded with statues, and traversed noiselessly its marble
floors. Passing through several chambers, we then mounted
to a corridor, and entered an apartment which formed the
ante-room to another beyond it, Placing his finger upon
his lips, and making a sign to his comrades, Cristofana
opened a door and disappeared. There was a breathless
pause for a few minutes, during which I listened intently,
but caught only a faint sound as of the snapping of a look.
Presently the old man returned.
 In sleeps,'' he said, in a low deep tone to me; ' sleeps
as his victim slept-sleeps without a dream of remorse;
and he shall awaken, as she awoke, to despair. Come into
his chamber t
Woe obeyed. The door was made fast within side.
The curtains of the couch were withdrawn, and the
moonlight streamed full upon the face of the sleeper. He
was hushed in profound repose. No visions seemed to haunt
his peaceful slumbers. Could guilt sleep so soundly1 I
half doubted the old man's story.
Placing us within the shadow of the canopy, Cristofano
approached the bed. A toilette glittered in his hand.
 Awake l'' he cried, in a voice of thunder.
The sleeper started at the summons.
I watched his countenance. He read Cristofano's errand
in his eye. But he quailed not.


A NIGHT's ADvENTURES IN ROB. 237
e Cowardly assassin 1'' he cried, `' you have well consulted
your own safety in stealing on my sleep.'
And who taught me the lesson 1'' fiercely interrupted
the old man. Am I the first that had stolen on mid-
night slumber7 Gaze upon this7 When and how did it
acquire its dye ?'' And he held forth a glove, which looked
blackened and stained in the moonlight.
The marehese groaned aloud.
 My cabinet broken open'' at length he exclaimed-
et plainly how dared you do this But why do I rare7 I
know with whom I have to deal,'' Uttering these words he
sprung from his couch with the intention of grappling with
the old man; but Cristofano retreated, and at that instant
the brigands, who rushed to his aid, thrust me forward. I
was face to face with the marehese.
The apparition of the murdered man could not have
staggered him more. His limbs were stiffened by the
shock, and he remained in an attitude of freezing terror.

 He is' cried Cristofno. Give him the weapon.'
And a toilette was thrust into my hand. Bat I heeded not
the steel. I tore open my bosom-a small diamond cross
