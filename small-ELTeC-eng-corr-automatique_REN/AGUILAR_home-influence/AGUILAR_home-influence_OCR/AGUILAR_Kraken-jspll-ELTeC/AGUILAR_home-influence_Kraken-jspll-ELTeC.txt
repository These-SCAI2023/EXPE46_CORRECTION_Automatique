MRS. HERBEHT TOWNSHEND BOWED.
MI Don NeXT,
Independent of the personal feelings which used
the dcdieation of these unpretending volumes to you, I know
few to whom a story illnstratie of a mother's solemn respond
sibilities, intense anxiety to fulfil tom, and deep sense of the
Influence of Him could, with more justice, be tendered.
Bible as is the actual narrative, the sentiments itsecks to illus-
irate, are so associated with you,-have been so astrengthcned
from the happy hours of unrestraiuced intercourse I have
 enjoyed with you-that, though i ought, perhaps, to have
 waited until I could late offered a work of far superior child
 to a mind like yours, I felt as if no story of mine could more
Y completely belong to you. Will you, then, pardon the ain
 national errors which I fear you, as a contest Protestant
 my discern, and accent this little or as a slight tribute of
the warm affection and sincere esteem with which you have
been so long regarded hy
Your truly attached friend,

PREEACE.
TuL following story will, the author trusts, sufficiently
illustrate its title to require but few words in the way
of preface. She is only anxious to impress two facts on
the minds of her readers. The one-that having been
brought before the public principally as the author of
Jewish works, and as an explained of the HIebrew Faith,
some Christian mothers might fear that the present
Work has the same tendency, and hesitate to place it
in the hands of their children. She, therefore, begs to
assure them, that as a simple domestic story, the
characters in which are all Christians, believing in and
practising that religion, all doetrinal points have been
most carefully avoid, the author seeking only to illus-
rate the spirit of true piety, and the virtues always design-
natel as the Christian virtues thence proceeding. Her sole
aim, with regard to Religion, has been to incite a train
of serious and loving thoughts towards God and man,
especially towards those with whom DIe has Inked is in
the precious ties of parent and child, brother and sister,
master and pupil.
PEACE.
The second point she is desirous to bring forward, is
her belief, that in childhood and youth the stolen sent-
ment is one of the safest guides to individual character;
and that if, therefore, she hare written more converse-
lion than may appear absolutely necessary for the
elucidation of  Home Influence,'' or the interest of the
narrative, it is from no wish to be diffuse, but merely to
illustrate her own belief. STIENT is the vehicle of
fruiT, and for the origin of across. CHiLd-
aren and youth hae very seldom the power to divine
character by action, and scarcely if ever understand the
mystery of thought; and therefore their unrestrainel
conversation may often greatly aid parents and teachers
in nursing a correct idea of their natural disposition,
and in giving hints for the mode of education each
may demand.
Leaving te beaten track of works written for the
young, the author's aim has been to assist in the education
of the n, believing that of infinitely greater im-
importance than the mere instruction of the saId, for the
bright awakening of the latter, depends far more on
the happy influences of the former than is generally
supposed.
Tluce moral of the following story the author know-
ledges is addressed to mothers only, for on them so
much of the responsibility of lIme Influence deserves.
rEACHED.
vii
On them, more than on any other, depends the well-doing
and happiness, or the error and grief, not of childhood
alone, but of the far more dangerous period of youth.
A prefer is not the place to enter on their mission.
The author's only wish i, to and by the thoughts,
which in some young mothers, anxious and eager to
perform their office, her story may excite. To daughters
also, she hopes it may not be found entirely useless, for
on them rests so much of the happiness of home, in the
simple thought of, and attention to, those little things
which so bless and inigorate domestic life. Of-
opportunities to evince the more striking virtues women
may never have, but for the cultiation an performance
of the lesser, they are called upon each day.
Should the story be deemed so far incomplete, as not
sufficiently to illustrate the fruits of the Home Influ-
once it narrates, the conclusion, in a separate story,
shall willingly he given.

A LAYCR.-A PROMISE.-A NEW RELATION.
In a very beautiful partor Wales, between the northern
boundaries of Glamorgan and the south-eastern of Car-
marthenshire, there stood, some twenty or thirty years
ago. a small straggling village. Its locality was so
completely concealed that the appearance of a gentle-
man's carriage, or in fact of any vehicle superior to a
light spring-cart, was of such extremely rare occur-
hence as to be dated, in the annals of Llangwillan, as
a remarkable went, providing the simple villagers with
amusing wonderment for weeks.
The village was scattered over the side of a steep and
rugged hill; and on the east, emerging from a thick
hedge of yews and larcles, peeped forth the pig-
treasure old church, whose tin-coated spire glittering
in the faintest sunshine removed all appearance of
gloom from the thick trees, and seemed to whisper;
whatever darkness lingered round, light was always
shining there. The churchyard, which the yews and
larches screened, was a complete natural figure, from
the holy cottage flowers, planted by loving hands
over many a rosy grass, and so allowed that not a

walls were cover with jasmine, roses, and honey-
suckle, marked the humble residence of the village

curate, from his spiritual gifts deserved a much higher
grade.
A curling stream ran leaping and sparkling over the
eggs hill till it formed a deep wide her for itself along
the road leading to the nearest town, embarked on one
side by a tall leafy white, and on the other by rich grass
and meadow flowers. By the side of this stream greps
of village children were continually found, sometimes
reading for some particular flower or inseet, or floating
pieces of wool with a twig stuck upright within them
as tiny fleets; but this amusement had given place the
last ten days to the greater excitement of watching the
progress of a miniature frighten, the workmanship of a
young lady who had only cry lately become an inmate
of the village. All had been at length completed, sails,
ropes, and masts, with a degree of neatness and beauty,
showing not only ingenuity but observation: and once
lovely summer eveing the ceremony of launching took
place. or a few minutes she totteret and reeled amidst
the tiny brcakers, then suddenly regained her equilibrium
and dashed gallantly along. A loud shout burst from

some twelve years, who contented himself with raising
his slight figure to its full height, and looking prouly

absorbed was the general attention that the very unusual
sound of carriage-wheels as remarked until close
beside them, and then so astounding was the sight of a
private carriage, and the coachman's very simple hues-
lion if that road led to the village, that all hung back
confused. The owner of the little vessel, however, an-
swered proudly and briefly in the affirmative. `` And
c you direct me, my good boy,''inquired a lady, looking
from the window, and smiling kindly at the abashed
group, `` to the residence of MIr. Fortescue, it is out of
the village, is it not ?
 Mrs. Fortescuel'' repeated the boy eagerly, and
gladly, and his cap was off his head in a moment, and
the bright sunshine streamed on a face of such remark-
able beauty, and withal so familiar, that though the lady
bent eagerly forward to address him, emotion so choked
her voice that the lad was enabled to reply to her inquiry,
and direct the coachman to the only inn of the village,
and they had driven of before words returned.
The boy looked eagerly after them, then desiring one
of his companions to meet the lady at the inn, and guide
her to the cottage, caught up his little vessel, and darted
off across some fields which le by a shorter cut to the
same place.
It was a very humble dwelling, so surrounded by hills
that their shadow always seemed to overhang it: yet
within, the happy temper of a poor widow and her
daughter kept up a perpetual sunshine. Three weeks
previous to the evening we have mentioned, a lady and
two children had arriel at Llangwillan, unable to pro-
need farther from the severe indisposition of the former.
They were unattended, and the drier only knew that

their destination was Swansea; he believe they had been
shipwrecked off Pembroke, and that the poor lady was
very ill when she commenced her journey, but the curious
inquiries of the illagers could elicit nothing more.
Mr. Mind, with characteristic benevolenee, devoted
himself to ensuring, as far as he could, the comfort of
the invalid; hal her removed from the inn to WIdow

disease was mortal, but that is presence and gentle
accents irritated instead of soothed. Ill-temper and
self-will seemed to increase with the weakness, which
eery day rendered her longing to continue her journey
more and more futile. It was some days before she
could even be persuaded to write to the relative she was
about to seek, so determined was she that she would get
well; and when the letter was forwardcd, and long before
an answer could have been received, (for twenty years
ago there are no railroas tu carry on epistolary come-

that she was abandoned, her children would he left

not listen to the peace he proffered, and so painfully
did his gentle eloquence appear to irritate instead of calm,

answer the letter in person, and by remoing anxiety
prepare the mind for better thoughts.
One object alone had power to bring something like
a smile to that uttered, but still most beautiful, count-
ance, conquer been irritation, and still create intervals
of pleasure-it was her on, the same beautiful boy we
have already noticed, and whose likeness to herself was

the care of relations indeed, but utter strangers to him,
and unlikely to treat him as she had done. She knew

regard her sister and her husband, would term and treat

and agony for him in the dread of what he might be

passionate tears, and shake her slight frame as with

The as we have mentioned, Edward had been absent
longer than usual, and towards evening MRs. Fortescue
awoke from a troubled sleep to brood over these thoughts,
tiLl they had produced their usual effect in tears and
sobs, the more painful to witness from the increasing
physical incapacity to struggle with them.
A little girl, between to and eleven years old, was
seated on a low wooden stool, half concealed by the
coarse curtain of the bed, employed in sewing some
bright gilt buttons on a blue jacket. It seemed hard
work for those small delicate hands; but she did not
look up from her task till roused by the too familiar
sound of her mother'as suffering, and then, as she raised
her head, and flung back the heavy and somewhat dis-
ordered ringlets, the impulse seemed to be to spring up
and try to soothe, but a mournful expression quickly
succeeded, and she sat several minutes without moving.
At length, as MRs. Fortescue's sobs seemed almost to
suffocated her, the child gently bent over her, saying,
very timidly, ``bAcon mamma, shrill I call Wide ORgan,
or can I get anything for you'' and, without waiting
for a reply, save the angry negative to the first question,

DIe has gone down to the stream to launch his little
private, MAmma, and asked me to fasten these buttons
on his jacket to make it look like a sailor' s meanwhile;
I do not think he will be very long now.''
Mrs, Fortescue made no rejoinder, except to utter aloud
those thoughts which had caused her previous paroxysm,
and her little girl, after a very evident struggle with
her own painful timidity, ventured to say:
' But why should you fear so much for Edward, dear
MAmma? Everybody lose him and admires him, so I
am sure my aunt and uncle will''
Your aunt may for my sake, but she will not love
or bear with his childish faults as I have done; and
your uncle is such a harsh, stern man, that there is
little hope for his forbearance with my poor Edward.
And he is so frank and bold, he will not know how men
to conceal his boyish errors, and he will be pnnished,
and his fine spirit broken, and who will be there to
shield and soothe him .'
I may be able sometimes, 3Mamma, and indeed, in-
deed, I will whenever I can,'' replied her child, with
aiicctipng earnestness. tI love him so very very much,
and I know he is so much better than I am, that it will
be very easy to help him whenever I can.''
 Will you promise me, Ellen, will you really promise
me to shield him, and save him from harshness when-
her it is in your power,'' exclaimed MRs. Fortcscue, ss
eagerly, that she half raised herself, and pressed Ellen
to her with an appearance of affection so unusual, and
a kiss so warm, that that moment never passed from the

in her own heart with a solemnity and firmess ol pnr-
pose little imagined by her mother, who when she
demanded it, conceived neither its actual purport nor
extent; she only felt relieved the inward would have
some one by him to love him and enable him to conceal
his errors, if he should commit any.
HAd she studied and known the character of Ellen
as she did that of her son, that promise would perhaps
never had been asked; nor would she so infectiously
and mistaken have laid so great a stress upon con
coralment, as the only sure means of guarding from
blame. From her childhood Mrs, kortescue had been
a creature of passion and impulse, and materuity had
unhappily not altered one tittle of her character. In
what manner, or not what cost, Ellen might be enabled
to keep that promise, never entered her mind. It had
ever been her wont, been in days of ealth, to examine

morbid indulgence of one exaggerated thought.
or several minutes she lay quite silent, and Ellen
resumed her seat and work, her temples throbbing, she

round her mother's neck, an enteat her only for one
more kiss, on other world of love; all the conscious-
less that she dared not, because the hot tears to rush into
her eyes, and almost blind her, but she would not let
them fall, for she had learned long ago, that while
Edward's tears only excited soothing and caresses, hers

voice some minutes afterwards, an Edward bound

MIss. Fortescue pressed him closer and closer to her,
returning his kisses with such passionate fondness, that
tears mingled with them and fell upon his cheek.
 Don't cry, Flamma, dear? indeed, indeed, my aunt
will soon come. Do you know I think I have seen her
and spoken to her, too,''
 Seen her, Edward? You mean you have dreamed
about her, and so fancy you have seen her;'' but the
eager anxious look she fixed on him cvinced more
hope than her words.
:No, no, MAmma:; as we were watching my ship, a
carriage passed us, and a lady spoke to me, and asked
me the way to the cottage where you lived, and I am
sure it is aunt Emmelinc from her smile.''
'It cannot be,'' murmured his mother, sally ; '` un-

listened eagerly.  Yes, yes, I am right, and she is
coming no: no, it is only Widow Organ, but I am
sure it is my aunt by your face,'' he added, impatiently,

flight of stairs in two bounds, he rushed into the little
parlour, caught holD of the lady's dress, and exclaimed,

mamma, she has been wanting you so long, so very
long, and you will make her well, dear aunt, will you not?''
 Oh, that I may indeed be allowed to do so, lear
holy'' was the painfully agitated reply, and she hastened
p the stairs.
But to Edward's grief and astonishment, so little
was he conscious of his mother's exhausted state, the
sight of his aunt, prepared in some measure as she
was, seemed to bring increase of suffering instead of
joy. There was a convulsive effort for speech, a s-

Edward in terror flung himself beside her, entreating
her not to look so pale, but to wake and speak to him.

usual alarm, and a careless observer might have said,

interval the choking thought found words.

earnest tenderness, `` lismiss such painful thoughts at

interrupting herself, as she met Edward's bright eyes fixed
wonderingly upon her face, and noticed the excessive
paleness of Ellen's cheek.  You look weary, my love,''
she said, kindly, drawing her piece to her, and affect-

GLIIPSES IYO A CHILD's HEART.-A DECIDED.
O leaving the cottage, Ellen hastily traverse the
little garden, and entered a narrow lane, leading to
MIr. Martin's dwelling. PIer little heart was swelling
high within her, and the confinement she had endured,
the constant control she exercised for fear she should
add to her other's irritation, combined with the ex-
tree delicacy of natural constitution, had so weakened
her, as to render the slightest exertion painful. She
had been so often reproved as fretful and ill-tempered,
whenever in tears, that she always checked and con-
sealed them. She had been so frequently told that she
did not know what affection was, that she was so
inanimate and cold, that though she did not understand
the actual meaning of the words, she believed she was
different to any one else, and was happy without
knowing why. Compared with her brother, she ccr-
vainly was neither a pretty nor an aching child.
Coldly from her birth, her residence in India had in-
reached constitntional delicacy, nd while to a watchful
eye the expression of her counlcuace denoted constant
suffering, the helpless and superlicial observer would
condemn it as pcevishness, and so unnatural to a young
child, that noting but eonfirmel ill-temper could have
produced it. The soft beautifully-formed black eye
was too large for her other features, and the slowness

of her complexion, the heavy tresses of very dark hair,
caused her to be remarked as a very plain child, which
in reality she was not. Accustomed to hear beaut
extolled above everything else, beholding it in her
mother and brother, and imagining it was ward's
great beauty that always made him so beloved and
petted, an evil-disposed child would have felt nothing
but easy and dislike towards him. But Ellen felt
neither. She loved im levotedly ; but that any one
could love her, now that the only one who ever had-
her idolized father-was dead, she thought impossible.
WHy er heart and temples beat so quickly as she
left her mother's room-why the promise she had so
lately made should so cling to her mind, that even her
aunt's arrival could not remove it-why she felt so
giddy and went as to render walking painful, the poor
child could not have told, but, unable at length to go
farther, she sat down on a grassy bank, ad helping
herself quite alone, cried bitterly. Several minutes
passed and she did not look up, till a well-known voice
inquired:-
`Dear Ellen, that is the matter? What has lap-
pencd to grieve you so to-day on't you tell me?''
Indeed, indeed, I do not know, dear arthur; I
only feel-feel-as if I had not so much strength as I
had a few days ago-and, and I could not help crying.''
 You are not well, Ellen,'' replied her companion,
a fine lad of sixteen, and Mr. Martin's only son.
 You are looking paler than I ever saw you before ; let
me call my father. you know he is always pleased
when he sees you, and he hoped you would have been
to us before to-day; come with me to him now,''

VOICE INLLENCL.
No, Arthur, indeed I cannot; he will think I ve
forgotten all he said to me the last time I saw him, and,
indeed, i have not-but I-I do not know what is the
matter with me to-day.''
And, in spite of all her efforts to restrain them, the
tears would burst forth afresh; and Arthur, finding all
his efforts at consolation ineffcetual, contcnted himself
with putting his arm round her and kissing them away.
A few minutes afterwards his father appeared.
`In tears, my dear Ellen t'' he said, kindly; ``your
mother is not worse, I hope ?''
 I do not know, sir,'' replied the child, as well as
her tears would permit; `` she has been very ill just now,
for her faint was longer than usual.''
 Di anything particular occasion it?2'
I think it was seeing my ant. Flamma was very
much agitated before and afterwards,''
'MRs. IIamilton has carried then I am rejoiced
to hear it,'' replied Mr. Mind, gladly. Then sitting
down by Ellen, he took one of her hands in his, and
said, kindly, `` Something has grieved my little girl this
evening; I will not ask what it is, because you may not
like to tell me; but you must not imagine evils, Ellen.
I know you have done, and arc doing, the duty of a
good affectionate child, nursing your suffering mother,
bearing with intervals of impatience, which her invalid
state occasions, and going up all your own wishes to sit
quietly by her: I have not seen you, my child, but I
know those who have, and this has pleased me, and,
what is of much more consequence, il rose you hare
not forgotten all I told you of your after in Given,
that even a little chill can try to love aunt serve llim.''
II3IN SILENCe.
 But have you not told me those who are good are
always happy''' inquired Ellen; '`the I cannot be good,
though indeed I try to be so, forlI do not think I am
happy, for can never laugh and sing, and talk, as
edward does.''
: You are not in such strong health as your brother,
my dear little girl, and you have had many things to
make you happy, which Edward has not. But you
must try and remember that even if it please God
that sometimes you should be more sorrowful than
other children, He loves you notwithstanding. I am
sure you hare not forgotten the story of Joseph that
I told you a few Sundays ago. God so loved him, as to
give him the power of foretelling events, and enabling
him to do a great deal of good, but when he was taken
away from his father and sold as a slave, and thrown into
prison amongst cruel strangers, he could not have been
very happy, Ellen. Yet still, young as he was, little
more than a child in those days, and thrown amongst
those who did not know right from wrong, he seems-
berel all that his father had taught him, and prayed ta
Go, and tried to love and obey IIi; and God was
pleased with him, and gave him grave to continue good,
and at last so blessed him, as to permit him to see his
dear father and darling brother again,''
`But Joseph was his father's favourite child,'' was
Ellen's sole rejoinder; and the tears, which were checked
in the eagerness with which she had listened, seemed
again ready to burst forth. DIe must have been

his brothers, and cnsed them to wish to send him away.
There was no excuse indeed for their conduct; but
perhaps if Joseph hal always remained near his father, he
might had been spoiled by too great indulgence, and
never become as good as he afterwards was. Perhaps in
his solitary prison he might even have regretted that his
father al not treated them all alike, as then the angry
feelings of his brothers would not have been called forth.
So you see, being a favourite will not always make us
happy, Ellen. It is indeed very delightful to be loved

much as we can, even if we are not sure of being loel
at first, we may be quite certain that we shall be loved

and how indelibly his reply was registered in the child's
memory,
It is a question none can answer positively, Ellen,
but it is my own firm belief, that the beloved ones
we have lost are permitted to watch her and love us
still, and that they see us and are often near us, though
we cannot see them. BUt even to help Edward,'' he
continued, somewhat anxiously, ``you must not be

He was interrupted by the appearance of a stranger,
who, addressing him courteously, apologised for his in-
rushing, and noticing the children, inquired if both were

Mr. Main replied, he could only lay claim to one;
the little girl was MIss Fortcsecne.
And my name is lIamilton, so I think I have an
uncle's privilege,'' was the reply; and Ellen, to her asto-
ishment, received an affectionate embrace from the
unknown relative, whom her mother's ill-judged world
had taught her actually to day. MIr. MIyrvin gladly
welcomed him, and, in the interest of the conversation
which followed, forgot the lesson he had been so anxious
to impress upon ellen. Arthur accompanied her to the
garden gate, and the gentlemen soon afterwards entered
the cottage together.
Days merged into weeks, and still Mrs. Fortescue
lingered; but her weakness increasing so painfully from
alternate fever and exhaustion, that to remove her was
impossible. It was the first time that MIss. Milton

the nearest town was twenty miles distant), but not a
selfish or repining thought entered MRs. Milton's
mind. It was filled with thankfulness, not only that
she was permitted thus to tend a sister, whom neither
error, nor absence, nor silence could estrange from her
heart, but that she was spared long enough for her
gentle influence and enduring love to have some effect
in changing her train of thought, coming that fearful
irritability, and by slow degrees permitting her to look
with resignation and penitent hope to that hour which
no human cfort could art. That MR. Moving should
seek MRs. IIamilton's society and delight in conversing
with her, MIss. Fortescue considered so perfectly that-
ran, that the conversations which took place in her sick
room, whenever she was strong enough to bear them,
excited neither surprise nor impatience. Different as
she was, wilfully as she had always neglected the mild
counsels and example of her sister, the years of sea-
nation and but too often excited self-reproach had fully
nwuakenel her to Mrs. mIlton's superiority. She had
never found any one at all like her,-so good and holy,
yet so utterly unassuming; and the strong affection,
been the deep emotion in one usually so controlled
with which her sister had met her, naturally increased
these feelings.

the lightness of her previous tone.
Mr, Myrvsin answered soothingly, and for the first
time his words were patiently received. From listening
listlessly MRs. Fortescue, by slow degrees, became in-
interest in the conrersations between him and MIr. and
Mr. Milton, and so a change in sentiments was gray-
dully wrought, which by any other and harsher me-
thou of proceeding would have been sought for in vain.
One evening as MRs. IIamilton sat watching the
faded countenance of her patient, and recalling those
days of youth and buoyancy, when it seemed as if
neither death nor care could ever hae assailed one so
bright and lovely, Edward, before he sought his fortune
stream, threw his arms round her neck, and pressed
his rosy lips of her cheek, as thus to wish her good
bye.
 DIe will repay you for all your care, nearest
Lmmeline,'' his mother said, with a heavy sigh, as he
left the room; ` I Now he has what you and your
husband will think faults, but, oh, for my sake, do not
treat him harshly; his noble spirit will be broken if
you do''
: Denrest Elennor, dismiss all such fears. Am I not
a mother equally with yourself? and do you think when
your children become mine I shall show any difference
between them and my own? you would trust me even
in former years, surely you will trust me now ?'
' Indeed, indeed, 1I do; you were always kind and
forbearing with me, when I little deserved it. But my
poor Edward, it is so hard to part with him, and he
loves me so fondly?'' and a few natural tears stole on
her cheek.

And he shall continue to love you, dearest Elennor;
and oh, believe me, all that you have been to him I will

darlings, and I do not fear to gain the love of yours;
and then it will be an easy task to make them happy us

`Earl's love you will very quickly obtain, if it be
not yours already; but Ellen youwill have more trouble
with. She is a strange, cold, unloveable child''
Are the dispositions of your children so unlike?
I should not have fancied Ellen cold; she is timid, but
that I thought would wear off when she knew me
better,''
It is not timility; I never knew her otherwise than
cold and reserved from her birth. I never could feel
the same towards her as I did towards Edward, and
therefore there must be something in Ellen to prevent

MRs. Milton did not think so, but she answered
gently, `` Are you quite sure, my lear Languor, that you

she never seemed even to know when I entered the

shout and laugh only to see me. Now what conduct
on my part could have done this? Surely I was just-
fed in feeling differently towards such opposite dismal-
position; and I know I never made more difference be-
tween them than-than papa did between us, Emmeline,
and I have had greater reason to be partial; you were
always better than I was.''
She ceased from exhaustion, but the flush which had
risen to her temples, and the trembling hands evinced
the agitation always called for by the mention of her
father, which MIss. Milton, with earnest tenderness,
endeavoured to soothe

violently, she hid her face on her sister's bosom.
It was long before MIss. IIamilton could calm that
fearful agitation, long before her whispered words of
heavenly hope, and peace, and pardon-if indeed she
believed-could bring comfort; but they did at length,

and such fearful paroxysms returned at longer and longer
intervals, and at length ceased, in the deep submission
and clinging trust to which she was at last permitted to
attain. Though Its. IIamilton was detained six weeks
at langwillan, her devoted attendance on her sister
prevented anything more than occasional observation of
the children so soon about to be committed to her care.
That eDward was most engaging and riveted her affection
at once, and that Ellen was unlike any child she had
ever known or seen, she could not but feel, but she was
not one to decide on a mere feeling. Her present
mournful task precntcd all actual interference with
them, except the endeavour by kindly notice to win
their confidence and love. IIi mother's illness and his
uncle's presence, besides, for the present, his perfect
freedom with regard to employment, had depried
Edward of all inclination to rebel or exert his self-will,
and Mr. and MRs. IIamilton both felt that he certainly
had fewer faults, than was generally the consequence of
unlimited indulgence. Whether Ellen's extreme attend-
lion to her mother, her silent but eycr ready help when
her aunt required it, proceeded from mere cold duty, or
really and its origin in affection, MRs. IIamilton could
not satisfactorily decide. PIer sister had avowed par-
quality, but that neglect and unkinduess could have been
shown to such an extent by a mother as to create the
cold exterior she called was so utterly incomprehensible,
so opposed to every dictate of maternal low, which she
knew so well, that she actually could not even imagine
it. She could believe in the possibility of a prcfercuce

as they could be no comfort to her, for she did not know

might be brought to her. She felt herself what the
physician had imparted to her sister, that the rccovery
of her senses would in all human probability he followed
in a few hours by death, and her last thoughts were on
them.
Edward, full of glee at being permitted to see her

change in that beloved face so startled and terrified
him, that he uttered n loud cry, and throwing himself
beside her, sobbed upon her bosom. MRs. orteseue
was fearfully agitated, but she conjured her sister not
to take him from her, and her heavy eyes wandered
painfully round the room in search of Ellen.

in her life forgot, and she clung to her in silent agony.

refused to stir from the bed; and Ellen, most union-

We the broken sentences that, in a voice scarcely
audible, and at long intervals, escaped MRs. TFortescue'as
lips, and then her head sunk lower on MIss. Milton's
bosom, and there was a long, long silence, broken only
by Edward's low and half-suffocated sobs. And he
knew not, guessed not the grief that was impending.
He only felt that his mother as worse, not better, as
he had believed would and must be when his aunt ar-
tired. He had never seen death, though Ellen had;
and he had passionately and wilfully refused either to
listen to or believe in his uncle's and MIr. MIrin's
gentle attempts to prepare him for his loss. Terrified
at the continued silence, at the cold heavy feel of his
mother's hand, as, when MIr. Mind and the widow
gently removed er from the still-supporting arm of
MRs. Hamiltaon, it fell against his, he started up, and
clinging to his aunt, implored her to speak to him, to
tell him why his mother looked so strange and white,
her hand felt so cold, and why she would not speak to
and kiss him, as she always did, when he was grieved.
MRs. IIamilton raised her head from her husband's
shoulder, and struggling with her own deep sorrow,
she drew her orphan nephew closer to her, and said, in
a low earnest voice, ` MAy Edward, did you not hear
our mother pray God to bless you''
The child looked at her inquiringly.

He had thought it hctter to remote her from us, and

But she is lying there,'' whispered Edward, in a
frightened voice, and half hiding his face in his aunt's
dress-``she is not taken away. We will she not speak
to me?''
She cannot speak, my sweet boy the soul which
enabled her to speak, and smile, and live, was God's
gift, and it has pleased IIi to recall it,''
`And will she never, never speak to me again? ill
she never kiss me-never call me her own darling,

him. : MAmma, mamma, my own dear, pretty, good
mamma, oh do not go away from me-or let me go with
you-let me die too ; no one will lore me or kiss me as you
have done,'' And even the natural awe and terror of death
gave way before his grief; he clung to the body of his
mother so passionately, so convulsively, that it required
actual force to remove him. nd for hours lis aunt
and sister watched over and tried to soothe and comfort
him in vain; he would only rouse himself angrily to ask
Ellen how she could know what he felt; she had never
loved their mother as he had-she did not know what

relapse into tears and sobs. Ellen did not attempt
reply. She thought, if it were such pain to her to lose
her mother, who had only the last few weeks evinced
affection for her, it must indeed be still more suffering
to him; and though his angry world grieved and hurt

he was so much better than herself) his very grief caused
her to love and admire him still more, and to believe
that she really did not feel as much as he did. And yet
before they quitted Ilangillan, which they did the
second day after MRs. Fortescue's funeral, Edward could
laugh and talk as usual-except when any object re-
called his mother; and poor Ellen felt that though she
had fancied she was not happy before, she was much
more unhappynow. Her fancy naturally vivid, and men-
were more so from her having been left so much to
herself, dwelt morbidly on all that had passed in her
mother's illness, on eery caress, eery unusual word of
affection, and on Mr. MIyrvrin's assurance that she would
love her in Heaven; the promise she had made to love
and help Edward returned to her memory again and
again, and each time with the increased determination
to keep it solely. It was not for her mother's sake
alone, and connected only with her; perhaps, lad it not
been for the careful instructions of her father, whom,
as we shall presently see, she had had cause almost to
idolise, Ellen might have become indifferent to her
mother and envious of Edward. But his repeated
instructions, under all circumstances, to love, chcrish,
and they her mother, had been indelibly cngraved, and
heighteedl natural feeling. She believed that to keep
the promise, which had so evidently pleased her mother,
would be also obeying her father, and this double
incentive gave it a weight and consequence, which, could
Mrs. IIamilton have known it, would have caused her
great anxiety, and urged its removal. But eLlen had
been too long accustomed to hide eery thought and
feeling to betray the which, child as she was, she

IIamilton watched her in silence, and trusted to time and
care to do their work; and by enabling her to under-
stand her character, permit her to guide it rightly.
The morning of their intended departure was bright
and sunny, and before even Will Organ was moving,
ellen had quitted er little bed and was in the church-
yard by her mother's are. She sat there thinking as
intently, that she did not know how time passed, till
she was roused by her favourite Arthur Mlyrrin's voice.
Up so early, Ellen, why I thought I should have
been first, to show you had not forgotten my promise.''
And he displayed some choice flower-roots which he
conceal planting round the grave.
Dear Arthur, how very kind you are; but you look
so sad-what is the matter? Does not MIr. VIrgin like
you to do this-pray, don't then,''
No, no, Ellen, my father said I was right, and
that he would take care of the flowers also himself.

whether he would like it or not; but they continued

she received, when Arthur explained hat had detained
them, reassured her, an bound her yet closer to the kind
relative whom, if timidity had permitted, she would
already have so loved.
The novelty of his situation, the rapid and pleasant
movement of his uncle's carriage, the idea of the new
relations he was about to meet, and an unconfessed but
powerful feeling of is ow increased consequence in
being so nearly connected to ealth and distinction, all
had their effect on Edward, and his eye sparkled and his
cheek glowed, as if all sorrow had entirely passed away;
not that he had ceased to think of his mother, for the
least reference to her would fill his eyes with tears and
completely check his joy-but still delight preiominated.
Ellen felt more and more the wish to shrink into herself,
for the farther they left Llangwillan, the more painfully
she missel MIr. MIyrvin and his son, and the more she
struck from encountering strangers. Edward she knew
would speedily find companions love, and to be loved
by, and he would think still less of her. PIer aunt would
soon be surrounded by her own children, and then how
could she expect to win her lose And eLlen looked

CHAPTER III.
REITROSPECTI0ON.-THE LOWLY sOUGHT,-THE LIGHT
FoILED.
I order clearly to understand the allusions of the
previous chapters, and the circumstances which had
formed the different characters of MIss. IIamilton and
MRs. Fortescue, it will be necessary to take a great-
spcctive glance on their early lives. Should it be union-
trusting to the more youthful of our readers, we will
beg them to proceed at once to  Traits of Character,''
but to their elder relatives, we hope the matter ill
prove of sufficient interest to obtain perusal.
Emmeline and Languor MIaners were the daughters
of Lord Element, a nobleman whose title and rank were
rather burdensome than otherwise, from the want of
sUfficient means to keep them up as inclination and
position warranted. Lady Element, whose energetic
yet gentle character would have greatly amelioratcd tha
petty vexation of her husband, lied when Declined
was only seven, languor five, and Charles, her only
boy, an infant of the years old. A widow lady,
Mrs. IIarcourt by name, had been selected by Lady
Element, in her last illness, as instructress and guardian
of her daughters. ller wishes, always laws to her
floating husband, were pretty iulfllc, and Mrs

3s
Hareaurt, two months after her friend's death, assumed
the anrduous and responsible duties for which her high
character well fitted her.
With Emmeline, though there were naturally some
faults to correct, an indolence and weakness to over-
come, and apparently no remarkable natural aptitude
for acquirement, her task was comparatively easy, for
her pupil had the capabilities, not only of affection but
of reference to a very great extent, and once loving and
respecting MRs. llarcaurt, not a command was new-
elected nor a wish unfulfilled. Languor, an the con-
tray, though so gifted that teaching might have been
a complete labour of lore-by self-will, violent passions,
and a most determined want of veneration, been
of common respect, a resolute opposition from her
earliest ears to the wishes of MRs. Harcourt, because
she was merely n governess, so much her inferior in
rank, rendered the task of education one of the most
difficult and painful that can be confided,-increased
from the injudicious partiality of Lord bDelmont. It was
not indeed the culpable negligence and dislike which
Languor afterwards displayed towards her own, but
originating in the fancy that Mrs. IIarcourt was unjust,
and melting was her favourite. Lord Element was
one of those unfortunately weak irresolute characters
that only behold the surface of things, and are there-
fore utterly incapable of acting either with vigour or
judgment. When he did venture into the precincts of
his daughters' apartments, he generally found Languor
in sobs and tears, and Emmeline quietly pursuing her
daily duties. That Mrs. Ilarcourt often entreated his
influence with her younger pupil, to change her house

of conduct, be never remembered longer than the time
her expostulations last. Once or twice indeed he
lit begin to speak seriously, but Elennor would throw
her arms round his week and kiss him, call him eery
wondering name, and beg him not to look so much
like grace, cross is. IIareourt, or she should think
she had indeed no one to love her; and her beautiful
eyes would swell with tears, and her voice quiver, so
that her gratified father would forget all his reproof
and gie her some indulgence to make up for the in-
justice and harshness she encountered in the school-
room. PIer power once thus experienced, of course,
was never resigned. PIer father's appearance in their
study was always the signal for her tears, which she
knew would confirm all his ideas of Mrs. IIarcourt's
unjust partiality.
And this idea was strengthened as they grew older,
and masters for paris accomplishments somewhat
lightened Mrs. Iareourt's actual labours. Emmeline's
steady applicntion and moderate abilities were last sight
of in the applause always clicited by her younger sister;
whose natural gifts alike in music, languages, and
drawing had full play, directly she was released even
in part from the hated tlrnldom of her governess.-
WIll Element hal been accustomed ta hear languor's
beauty extolled, and now the extraordinary versatility
and brilliancy of her talcnts became the theme of every

thus seeking to carry favour. MRs. IIarcourt was the
only one from whom he never heard Languor's praises,
and the only one, who spoke in praise of Emmeline. It
must then be wilful blindness on her part, and the father
felt indignant, but in spite of himself had too much real
respect for her individually to do more than redouble
his indulgence to Elennor. kEmmeline could not tom-
plain of her father's neglect, for he was both kind and
affectionate to her; but she did sometimes wish she
could he quite sure that he loved her as much as her
sister; and her deep affections, nnsuspeetel by her father,
rejected and laughed at by Languor, twined themselves
closer and closer round MIss. IIarcourt, and her brother
Charles, on whom she actually dozed, and who returned
her affection with one quite as fond and arm, as a
happy, laughter-long, frank-hearted boy had it in his
power to bestow; yet even his holidays were times of
as much suffering as joy to his sister, from the violent
quarrels which were continually taking place between
him and Elennor. Emmeline, happy in herself and
MRs. IIarcourt's companionship, could endure Languor's
determined supremacy and, except where her conscience
disapproved, yielded to her. but this could not be
expected from Charles, who, despite his elder sister's
gentle entreaties, would stand up for what he called her
rights, and declare that when he was at home, Miss
Languor should not lord it or the whole family.
Languor only of course quarrel first with him and then
appeal to her father, who without hearing the case
would give her right, and harshly condemn Cares,
whose high spirit revolted; and unable to bear with his
father's weakness of character, as he ought to have done,

would answer isrespcetfully; and words succeeded hours
till Charles in a desperate passion would seek Lame-
line's chamber, and his father, though he actually deeply
loved and was very proud of his son, wished that the
holidays were over and Charles safe again at school.
Trifling as domestic disputes may seem in description,
they never fail in their painful reality to banish all
lasting happiness, Emmeline could bear that her father
should prefer Elennor to herself, but that he should be
just to her darling Charles, and that Charles should
increase this evil by ispute and self-will, tried hen
severely, and obliged her often and often to fly to the
solitude other own chamber, lest her temper also should
fail, and to defend her brother, she should forget hen
duty to her father. but with her MIss. IIareonrt'a
lessons had indeed been blessed. The spirit of true
heartfclt pity, which she had sought to instil into her
youthful charge, been more by the examples of her daily
lite than by precepts, had become Emmeline's, young
as she still was, and enabled her not only to bear up
against the constant pctty annoyance of her honc, but
the heavy trial sustained in the death of Mrs. IlIarcourt,
just as she was looking forward to her entrance in the
gay world, under her maternal guardianship, and her
parting with her brother, who not two months after-
wards left lover to fulfil his darling wish of going to sea.
At eighteen, then, lEmmeline Manners became the mis-
dress of her father's establislicnt, and had to encounter
alone, not only the suffering of bereuvemeut-in which,

that when she became old enough to claim her right

have looked down on the child of her love, she would
indeed have rejoiced nt the beautiful fruition of her
labours. For Element was not astonished and delighted
on, a feeling of respect towards his gentle, his truthful
child entered his heart, such as he had experienced
towards none, she her mother. Emmeline would indeed
have thought all her toils repaid, could she had known
this, but the very feeling prevented the display of that
caressing affection he still lavishel on Languor, and the
tears of his elder girl often fell thick and fast from the
painful longing for one similar caress, one evidence on
his part, that, though neither so beautiful, nor assented,
nor engaging as Languor, she could yet minister to his
comfort and increase his happiness.
ut Emmeline's strong feeling of religion, life it
enabled her to bear up against care and the constant
nd most painful feeling of loneliness, rendered the
trial of beholding her sister's wilful course of error, if
possible, still more severe. She knew that all her after-
inmates council were worse than useless, that though
Elcmnor could be even caressingly affectionate when it
served her purpose, would even listen to her at the
moment of suffering from some too hasty impulse, she
had no lasting influence. And this came more and
more evident as clear became the almost constant
companion of the Marchioncss ascelles, their only
female relative. It was the evil influence of his
lady which had so increased Languor's natural rough-
ance to Mrs. IIarcourt's gentle sway, that for full two
years before the latter's death the flattery of Only

Lascelles and Languor's passionate entrcaties had pre-
railel on Lord Delmout to permit his daughter being
more with her than with her sister and governess.
Lady Lascelles was a woman of the world, utterly
heartless, highly distinguished, and supremely fashion-
able. At her house all the top of the head monde
congregated, and scandal, frivolity, and esprit were the
prevailing topics, diversified with superficial opinions
of the literature, arts, and politics of the day, and
various sentimental episode, which the lady of the
house endured for the sake of variety. IIere Elceanor,
even at fourteen, was made a popular idol; er extreme
beauty, her vanity, her talents, her sharpness of
departed, all were admired, extolled, and encouraged.
At seventeen she was introduced and initiated into all
the mysteries of an ultra-fashionalle life, and very
speedily added to her other accomplishments-all the
arts of a finished and heartless coquette.
With Lady lLascelles for her chaperon, it was not
very surprising that Emmeline MIaners shrunk in pain
and real from her introduction into society; but yet
she knew her social duties too well to refuse, and, by
an affectation of superior sanctity, which of course
would have been the charge leelled against her, throw
a sneer upon those holy feelings and spiritual prince-
plas which had become part of her very being. She
entered into society, but the isolation to a heart like
her of the countries of Lady Lascelles and her friends,
was indeed most painful, and aggrarated by the constant
dread which the contemplation of Landor's reckless
career could not but occasion.

clusive than the assemblage of LAdy ILscelles, the
attention of both sisters was attracted to a young and,
by name Arthur Hlamilton-Languor, from his vision-
guished appearance and extreme reserve, Emmeline, by
the story attached to his name. IIi father had so
distinguished himself in the amelioration of the pea-
story and working classes in various parts of England,
in addition to various services of a private and confi-
denial nature from the home government to the
courts abroad, that a viscountcy was offered to his
acceptance. The message from roalty reached him on
his death-bed, and though, from the faint and flickering
accents with which he replied to the intended honour,
it seemed as if he declined it, it was attributed to the
natural feelings of a dying man, seeing the utter
nothingness of earthly honours, and the title was gone-
mostly proposed to his son. But Arthur Milton had
not been the pupil and friend of his father in vain.
With a calm dignity and uncompromising independence,
he declared that he had neither claim nor heirship to
the reward of his father's services; that he believed his
parent would himself have refused it, preferring the
honourable distinction of being an untitled English men-
tleman, to the unable honour of a newly-created
lordship. He respectfully thanked the government
for the honour they intended, bUt decisively refused it-
that his denrest inheritance was his father's name.

ELLEN's unfounded dislike towards Arthur FAmily-

being the only one who had remained proof against all
the fascinations she had thrown in his way. Even in
her childhood, if any one chanced to notice Emmeline
more than herself it was considered a mortal offence,
and the person who had so offended was scarcely spoken
to gain. Therefore that Emmeline should he married
before herself, mud to the man she intended to captivate,
but it to one, or wed, was an offence visited on her
sister by the withdrawal of her speech for six months,
and on MIr. IIamilton by an insulting haughtiness of de-

her extreme annoyance, she found that even as she had

unhappiness and mischief which their supposition of

T6 kEmmeline, the change in her young life was so
marvellous, so complete- care, anxiety, loneliness, that
sinking of the whole frame and heart, from the absence
of appreciation and social kindness, had so departed,
leaving in their stead such an intensity of quiet domes-
ti happiness, that it was long before her full heart
would believe it reality, and rest secure. She had always
longed for one to reverence, to cling to, and her husband
gave her room for both. As his betrothed, even before
their marriage, she had been introduced to very different
society to that of the MIarchioness; she beheld him
reverence, loved, appealed to by the wisest and the
best men, often older than himself. That this man
should so love, cherish, and actually reverence her, no
wonder that under the magic of such feelings her cha-

Lady Lascelles. As to joining society with MIr. and
Mrs. Milton, when they were in London, Elennor
would not hear of it. But to her sister's great joy and
some surprise, she accepted an invitation to Oakwood,
a short time after little Perry's birth, and, still more
surprising, condescendel to make herself agreeable.
The London season had tired her, and she thought she
might just as well be all on the banks of the Dart in
August and September as in some stupid watering-place.

moved all their rising hopes, and caused such increased
and intense anxiety, as so to injure her already delicate
health that her husband more her back to Oakwood a
full month before they had originally intended.-
Whether or not Languor loved Lord Fitzeclair, it was
impossible to determine; but that deotcdly, passion-
lately loved her, was only too evident, not only to the
world hot to herself, and this once confirmed, she left

it, try if his aifections ere orth having. He was
half an Italian, and he inherited all the strong, fierce

he knew himself, and conjured hi to withdrew from
the society of one who could never make him happy,
and those capricious conduct was so likely to elder
him desperate and miserable: he resolved, started in
vain. `She only wants to try the strength of my
lore,'' was his sole reply; '`and were she to torment

mine yet.''
And to the astonishment of Mr. and MRs. Milton,

ally was accepted, with the sole condition that their

Languor to name the wedding day, which could not be

in Cheltenham with a very gay party, in which Languor
was still of course the star. MRs. IIamilton entered the
nursery one morning earlier than usual, for her infant
had not been well the night before, and she had already
experienced the care as well as the joy of a mother. PIer
babe was better, and as he lay smilingly and happily in
her lap, and watched the eager movements of his
brother, she was only sensible of pleasure. The nurse
had arranged the chairs in a long line, that MAster
Perry might, with their help, walk the whole length of
the large and airy room. The feat mightily pleased
the little gentleman, who having acquired the venerable
age of fifteen months, liked better to feel his feet than
crawl on the floor, or be carried about on any limbs but
his own. eVery two or three paces he stood nearly
alone, and burst into a loud merry laugh, which was
always echoed by a crowd of joy from his little brother.
 Take care, Percy, love, don't fall and frighten
mamma,'' said his young mother, who was watching
him with such pleasure as to send for his father to
share it. When her son, to prove how well le obeyed
her commands to take care, stood for a second without
hy part, and then ran quite alone across the room,
and with a yet louder laugh hid his rosy face in her
lap. Mrs. IInmilton fondly kissed the little nestling
head, and at that moment her husband entered the
room.  Dearest Arthur,'' she eagerly exclaimed, I

his heart, held him for above a minute, kissed him
fondly, and left the nursery without uttering a single

 Let me take Master Herbert, ma'am,'' said the
head nurse respectfully, for she saw that her mistress's
expressed alarm had nearly overpowered her; and in
a few minutes Emmeline was with her husband, whose
agitation was so excessise, that even his wife's presence

The tale was soon told. Elennor's conduct since her
engagement had been such as to excite the displeasure,
not of her father alone, but actually of the Marchioness;
who, though a weak and worldly woman, had yet some
men of propriety. As a near relation of Lord Element,
Languor's engagement with Lord Fitzelir was of course
told to her, and again and again she warned her that
she was going too far, and might lose her lover before
she was aware of it; but languor only laughed at her,
and at last won her her to the belief that it was her-
vainly better to cure Fitzclair of his jealous tendency
before marriage than afterwards. Lord bDelmont's re-
proofs she was wont to silence, by invariably making

so enhanced her own fascinations, that all the agony he
had endured and was still, he knew, to endure, by an
incomprehensible contraliction, riveted her power and
hastened his own doom. WAlk in all things but his
lore, he could not demand as his actual right the rub-
relation of their engagement. Languor owed if he did,

her actions, which she did not choose to endure. And
father, lover, and friend, all feeling she was wrong, and
the first and lasst repeatedly telling her so, had yet
neither of them the resolution to contend with her, and
compel the proper course.
A month of their visit to Cheltenham so passed, when
Languor's attention was arrested by a new actor of the
scene. She had begun to tire of her present satellites,
and a dog military captain, whose furlough from
Inlia had just exspired, and whose pale face, somewhat

anew every curious feeling. It was easy for Cunning
Fortescue to discover Fitzclair as his rival; but be-
living himself decidedly the object of Languor's pre-
fierce, he increased his atteutions, little imagining the
storm he was exciting, the more fell from its deter-
mind suppression. Lord Element interfered several
times, not only by reproaches to Languor, but by deter-

mind coldness to where suitor. Finding at length that
her encouragement actually neared a criminal extent, and
after a desperately stormy interview, he solemnly de-
claret that if she did not dismiss Captain Tortescue at
once, he would shame her in the face of the whole
world, by proclaiming her engagement with the young
Marquis. Languor in equal anger declared that if he
threatened, so too could she, and if he tormented her
any more she would present all publication of her en-
gagement, by herself snapping it asunder, and plelging
her faith to Captain Forteseue. This was too much
even for Lord Element. Declaring if she did so, a
father's heaviest mnlediction should fall on her head,
e hastily left her; and Languor very composedly
went to prepare for an excursion on horseback with
Fortescue, Fitzclair, and others.
When Lord Desmond's passions were once roused,

him, and he did that which at another time, knowing
Fitzelair as he did, he would have shrunk from. HE

dust, and warned him that, if he is not adapt some
strong measures to prevent it, he would certainly lose
her entirely.
The young man heard him without reply; but his
face grew livid, and he clenched his hand till the blood
started from the nails, and in this mood of concentrated
passion joined the riding art. The exercise itself is

Ill pleased an interview with her on their return
home, struggled to speak calmly, espostulated, and,
finally, reproached. Languor, already irritated; and be-
yonl all that her lover, in general so obsequious and
humble, should care to call her to account, for mere
amusement, combined with the recollection of Captain
Fortescue's flattering own and willing homage; excited
her to an extent of which she as herself unconscious,
inasmuch as she firmly believed, ' whatever she might
say then, a few soft words would speedily obliterate.
She told him that really his jealous temperament was
beyond all endurance; that he certainly must intend
her to despise and abhor him; and that the contrast ho
presented to Captain Fortescue was such as to make her
most heartily wish to put an end to their engagement,
as she felt quite sure it must only end in misery for
both; and, without waiting for a reply, she augltily
herself by him and disappeared.
Of the extent of Fitclir's passion Languor had not
the least idea, and this is saying a great deal, for she
generally exaggerated her own power. She believed
she had inflicted pain, but not as much as he deserved;
and determined that she would torment him et more
at the ball that evening. But to her extreme mortifi-
eating he did not appear, and there was a vague dread
on her spirits as she retired for the night, which pre-
vented anything like rest. lIps absence he excited

most painful excitement by the incomprehensible and
most extraordinary fact of the suicide of Lord Fitzelair;
by what oceasioned, plunged into such mystery that
nothing but sudden aberration of mind was imagined,
a belief justified by the very peculiar temperament and
manners of the young nobleman during his sojourn with
them. IIi will, a valuable present, with a few lines of
regard to his faithful attendant, and a letter addressed
to Arthur Milton, Esq., were the sole evidences that
the awful deed had not been committed without some
preparation; but is that was often the case with mad-
less itself, it excited no remark.
The state of Landor's mind when these awful tidings
were communicated to her, which they were by her
father, in his agitation and anger, without the least
preparation, we line our readers to imagine. Her-
denied, heartless, wilful as she was, she was still a
woman, and a very young one, and till Captain
Fortescue appeared, had loved, as far as it was in her
nature, Lord Fitzclair. To believe that she had nothing
to do with his miserable end was an attempt so rain
and hollow, that even she shrunk from the hopeless
struggle to realize it; remorse in all its torturing, upon-
started anguish took possession of her, but instead of
leading her to penitent, and thence the hope of peace,
it urged her to a course of action from which she
imagined there was no withdrawing, and which must
in time, by remoing her from all painful associations,
lessen her present misery.
For three days and nights she never quitted her own
apartment, and then joined her usual circles without
the smallest evidence of the internal agony which was

artificial roses, and her gay smiles and joyous sallies were
tempered only by a judiciously-expressed horror when
the late tent was discussed before her, supposed natural
to one who had known him so intimately; but the
hours of loneliness which followed this conduct in
society were terrible indeed. bY a strange contrariety
of feeling, er better nature longed for Emmeline,
and her artificial, which had, alas only too forcibly
become her natural self, felt as if she would leave the
kingdom rather than encounter the mill, sorrowful
glance of those penetrating eyes.
Lord Element was himself in a most pitiable con-
dition; even minor evils had always been great to him,
and the effect of this, the wish to take Languor away
from Captain Fortescue's increased and annoying attend-
lions, and yet the dread that doing so would conneet
er with Fitzclair's death, so distracted him as to render
him really ill-information which instantly brought MIr

her usual hour of rising after such scenes, she entered
her sister's room. All around her la the ornaments
of the previous evening, looking so strange, gaudy, and
faded in the darkened room, and judged by the calmer
feelings of the morning. A sensation of intense le-
passion crept over Emmeline as she gazed, increasing
as she looked on the face of the sleeper, which, divested
of its unnatural bloom, looked so fearfully wan and
haggard. Her beautiful hair lay in tangled masses on
her damp brow, and as Emmeline gently tried to re-
move it, Languor started and awoke.
 Is it already time to get up?'' she said, languidly,
and only half unelosing her eyes; I feel as if I had
not slept at all. Am lI dreaming?'' she added, starting
up, ``or have I slept in one place and woke in another

The voice, the look seemed to thrill through her;
her temples were throhbing, her heart weighed down, as
it always was when she first awoke, with an undefinable
sense of guilt and pain; she tried to be cold, proud, re-
secret, but it would not do, and she suddenly flung her
arms round her sister's neck, and burst into agonized
tears.
It was a most unexpected greeting, and MRs. IIamilton
argued woefully from it. Alas. the unwonted softening
only lasted one brief half hour. She left her at

ever severe her words might be, she could not alter her
tone, that must be kind, in spite of herself. Yet
Emmeline could not succeed in continuing her how
wrongly, how cruelly she had acted. Languor would
persist that she was not in the least to blame, and that
poor Fitzclair's fearful end was only owing to his own
violent passions, in fact, that he must have been out of
his mind, and that, though it was certainly very dread-
ful, she had perhaps escaped a very terrible doom; but
speak as she might, Emmeline was not receive as to
the agony she was actually enluring. THinking, hoveer,
that all her gentle arguments ere useless, that even
the perusal of Fitzclair's brief lines to her husband,-
which Languor insisted on seeing, and in which he de-
plored his madness in not having followed his advice,
and flown from her presence, mud bale him take his for-
likeness to her, and say, that the means he had adopted
would, he trusted, dissolve their engagement to her satin-
action,-had no effect, save in causing her to turn sa
deadly pale, that her sister was convinced nothing but
an almost supernatural effort of pride presered her
from fainting. sHe despised; hoping against hope that
Languor would yet repent and become a different being.
She knew harshess would only harden, and so she
tried to prevail on her father to treat her as usual, but
this Lord Element could not do. It is strange how
often we find those parents who have been over-mind-
gent to childhood unusually harsh to the faults of
youth. Weak characters, also, when driven to anger,
are always more violent than firmer ones; and, certain,
Languor's continued haughtiness and coldness, as if she
were the injured one, did not tend to calm him.

s
And his angry feelings were unfortunately but too
soon aggravatcd by a proposal in form from Captain
Fortescue for the hand of Landor. ithout a no-
ment's delay, he despatched a decided and almost
insulting refuse to the young soldier, and then sought
his daughter, and vented on her the anger and vex-
action which oerpowered him, upbraiding her not only
with the death of Fitzclair, but for having dared so to
encourage young Fortescue as to give him courage
for his audacious proposal. To his astonishment,
he was heard without any attempt at reply; but he
would have been startled, could he have seen the pallid
cheek, compressed lip, and clenched hand with which,
when he had left her, Languor muttered-
 Father, if it be six to lace you, be it on your own
head. I would have wedded with your consent, had
you permitted it; but no my destiny is fixed. There
is no peace in England: at least let me be spared the
Agony of breaking another loving heart.''
Nearly three weeks rolled on, and Languor's ex-
extraordinary submission, and even in some degree
withdrawal from society (for which MIss. Milton's
arrival was a good excuse), caused her father's irritation
against her almost entirely to beside. That she
passed several hours each day apart from her sister
excited no surprise. Emmeline was thankful even for
her change of deportment, but nothing confidential
her again passed between them. That reports were
floating about, connecting the names of MIss MIaners
and the late Lord Fitclair, seemed little hecled hy

father, and living ten miles from Cleltenham in a
beautiful ill, at which she expected a select party
of fashionables to realise for a week or two. There
was nothing in the note to excite the read that
weighed on MIss. IIamilton's spirits, as Languor care-
less threw it to her for her perusal, but she would
not express it, as Lord Element seemed inclined that
Languor should accept it, knowing that the lady was
much too exclusie for Captain Fortescue to join her
guests, and believing that Languor's apparent indif-
reference to the visit originnted from that cause. Telling
her, he was so gratifiel by her having devoted so many
evenings to her sister, he added, she had his full con-
sent to go if she liked, as he could better spare her
then than when Emmeline returned to Oakwood. She
quietly thanked him, but evincedno particular pleasure.
The day before her intended departure, the sisters
were sitting together, and little Perry, who now ran
firmly without any falls, was playing about the room.
He had already displayed a light spirit and passionate
temper, with their general accompaniment, self-will,
even in trifles, that MIss. lIamilton felt would render
her task a trying one; but she was no firm as she

smiled.
 Why would you not let that poor little Percy have
that toy?''
Because it would have been encouraging his touch-

him or not.''
 But he could not understand that.''
 Not now, perhaps; but I wish him to know that
when I speak, he must obey me. It is, I think, a
mistaken doctrine, that we ought to give children a
reason for all we desire them to do. Obedience can
then never be propt, as it ought to be. And in fact,
if we wait until they are old enough to understand the
reasons for a command, the task will be much more
difficult, from the ascendcncy which wilfulness may
already have obtained.''

he will love me more. And it is that hope which
reconcile me to the pain which refusing to indulge
him costs me now,''
' And oluntarily you will bear the pain which had
almost brought tears into the eyes of the severe and

 It was a foolish weakness, my dear lEleanor, for
which my husband would have chidden me; but there

The following day, resse for her visit, and only
waiting for the carriage, languor, accompanied by MRs,
IIamilton and her little boys, entered the same apart-
ment. Though not in general fond of ursing, Languor
had taken llerbert in her arms, and was playing with
him with unusual fondness ; Percy, who had not seen
the tempting plaything since his banishment the pre-
ceding at, the moment his eye caught it, to the
astonishment of lenor, ran up to his mother, and
lisping forth, ``Me no touch that-Mercy good hoy now,''
held up his little face lovingly to her, and with a very
pardonable feeling of delight, MRs. 1Milton lifted him
up and covered him with kisses. The feelings which
thrilled through Languor at that moment she might
indeed have found it difficult to explain, but she was so
conscious of a change of countenance as to hide her
face on lIberty's head. It might have been obedience

al gone too far, and the announcement of the carriage
was a relief from that bitter moment of painful inde-
vision. Placing her baby nephew in his nurse's arms,
she said, cressingly,  Will not 'mercy give Line some of
those kisses as well as mamma?'' The child threw one
little arm round her neck, and this other round that of
his mother, and then burst into a merry laugh at thus
seeing himself as it were a link between them. Never

Though Languor had been his fortune, his feeling

career in fie years' active service on board a man-of-
war, had been such as to raise him already to a little-
fancy, and excite cry gratifying emotion, not only in his
immediate family, but in a large circle of admiring
friends. MRs. Milton's love for her brother had
naturally increased, strong as it always had been, even
in childhood,--and the visits which Charles had been
enabled to make to Oakwood, brief in duration as they
were compelled to be, had always been draught with
heartfelt joyous happiness, not only to herself but to her
husband. The pain and anxiety attendant on Elennor's

could he no more doubt that death or slavery-that fear-
ful slavery which the bombardment of Earlier had so
displayed to lEuropean eyes-was the portion of all those
beloved ones, for whom so many aching hearts and eyes
had watched and wept in vain. It was a trial so terrible,
that MIss. Milton felt at first as even submission and
departed from her; and she could almost have rebelled
in spirit against the inscrutable lecree, that had con-
signed one so free from ice and evil, so full of happiness
and worth, to a doom so terrible. MUch as she had
loved and reverence her husband before, she seemed
never to have felt lis worth and tenderness till then.
It as his sympathy, his strength, that recalled her to
a sense of her duty, and gave her power to church, by
a retaliation once more of the submissiseness to a
Father's will, which had never before filed her. But
time, though it softened the first anguish, had no power

of tranquil happiness, o draught with the innumerable
daily joys of a loving wife and devoted mother, that her
prayer was her rising for guidance, and gratitude, that
prosperity might not unfit her for the dark days of trial
and adversity, when they should come. That she had
cares as well as joys could not he otherwise, when so
intensely anxious to bring up her children with ore
regard to their spiritual and moral welfare, than even
the cultivation of their intellect. She was one of those

of the mind, believing that were the last properly
awakened, the latter would need little incitement to

One other wish, and one of many years' standing,

Harvest as one, to whom it might one day he in her

with her from very early years, Mrs. Iareonrt delighting
in creating a mutual interest between her pupil and the

rated her. When therefore an event of a very painful
nature to Miss IIarcourt's individual feelings compelled
her, as the only hope of regaining ease, and strength-
ending her for the arduous duty of instruction, which she
knew, as a single woman, as her sole source of inde-
pendent subsistence, she had no scruple in accepting
that friendship which MIss. IIamilton had so warmly
proffered. A very few days of personal intercourse

not deceived in the favorable impressions of either. MIss
Hareourt found, indeed, the friend her aching spirit
needed; and Mrs. Milton, long before the months of
repose which she had insisted should forestall the cow-
mincemeat of exertion ere are, rejoiced in the ceon
fiction that the daughter of her beloved and regretted
friend was indeed well-fitted for that position in her
family, her helper in the moral and intellectual training
of lcr daughters, which her did fancy had often pick-
turned as so filled. They were indeed hut infants when
Miss Harcourt arrived; but Mr. and MRs. IIamilton
found means to overrule the honourable scruples which,
on the part of Luck, seemed at first against their plan,
and in her gradually returning health and peace, MRs.
lIamilton not only rejoiced but felt gratefully thankful
that the wish of so many years' standing, and which had
seemed so little likely to he fulfilled, was absolutely
accomplished, and she could prove how deeply she had
loved and mourned her truly matemnal friend. It is
astonishing how often, if an earnest heartfelt desire for
the gratification of some good feeling or for the perfor-
dance of some good deed be steadily and unvaryingly
had before us, without any regard to its apparent
impossibility, its accomplishment is at length obtained.
It is supposed to be only lone so in books, but this is a
mistaken supposition, arising from the simple fact of
indiiduals so often forgetting their own past, and
failing steadily to pursue one object, regardless of the

That Languor could realize true happiness in a

the torture of her own thoughts, and her constant
dread of the world's contumely, as not likely. At
first, indeed, it was a very delightful thing to find
herself the object, not only of devotion to her husband

might have really loved), but a still more brilliant star
in India than she had even been in england. Though

But as his health, always delicate, became more and
more undermined, and compelled him to relinquish
society, at least in a great measure, and to look for
the quiet pleasures of domestic life, he found, and
bitter was that first awakening, that his wishes, hie
comfort, were of no importance. She could not resign
the pleasures of society-of still being enabled to pur-

just as he liked, and if he did not care to see her
surrounded, as she knew she was, by red coats, she
would dismiss them all, and devote herself to him-
but indeed she could not stay at home,-he would feel
that it would be cruel indeed to chain such a being
to his side, and sometimes me the exertion (for
which he was little fitted) to accompany her; at others,
with kind words and indulgent love, permit her to
follow her own wishes, and remain alone. But little
if he think the real reason that Languor could not rest
in quiet at home. The recollection of Lord itzelasir
was at such times s fearfully vivid, that the very age
she had endure when first told of his fearful end
would return in all its intensity; the thought, had
her father really cursed her for her disobedicnce, and
was it that for ever hoering round her, preventing
anything like lasting happiness. And yet, by a strange
contradiction, while the idea of her father's curse
shook her whole frame at times with convulsive
sobs, pride, that most fatal ingredients of her cha-
rate, utterly prevented all attempt on her part to
communicate with her relations. She said, as they
had made no effort to conciliate, she would not;
and yet the longing for Emmeline sometimes became
actually painful.
Languor was never intended for the heartless, reckless
being she had tried to become. It was a constant
and most terrible struggle between the good and evil
parts of her nature, and though the evil triumphed-

course of action, nothing compel her to acknowledge

obsequious, adopted the same opinion; and, before she
was even three years old, harshness, both by use and
mother, had been constantly used, to make Ellen as
good a child as her brother.
In ain did the Colonel, when he became aware of
this treatment, remonstrate that it as the illness of
the poor child,-neither obstinacy nor ill-temper: his
wife would not understand him, and at length he
sternly and peremptorily declared, that as she had her
will with Edward, he would she his with Ellen, and
that no cehastisement should be inflicted. If she is
wRong, he was to be told of it, and if necessary he
would prove her, but he would allow no other in-
preference. MRs. Fortescue made not the least object-
lion, blessing that as her husband had thus taken
her in charge, she was exonerated from all blame if
she left her entirely to him.
Only too quickly did the poor child discover that
the lovely being whom she called mother, and whom
she loved so fondly, had no love, no caress, for her.
Repented punishment, though it had only extended
to her fifth year, had completely crushed the gentle

what claim had her mother upon the feelings he sought

in all things; that if she did so, she would be as
happy as Edward in time, and Ellen, though she did
not understand him, obeyed; but Colonel rescue
little imagined the evil which was wavering from these
very natural lessons.
Ellen leaped to believe that as her mother never
noticed her, except in accents of anger or irritation,
it must be her own fault. She longed to be beautiful
and buoyant as Edward; and that she was neither,
marked her in her own young mind as so inferior,
it was no wonder her mother could not caress or love
her. IIad Edward presumed on his favourites, and
been unkind or negleetful, she might perhaps have
envied more than she loved him; but his disposition
was naturally so noble, so open-hearted, so generous,
that he always treated her with affection, and would
share with her his playthings and sweets, even while
he could not but believe her in all things his inferior;
and that as such, of course, her wishes could never
cross with his,-poor child, she scarcely knew what
it was to wish, except that she might cling to her
mother as she did to her father, and that she could but

observers may believe: and MRs. Fortescue blamed
and disliked the cold inanimate exterior which she
had never tried to warm.
ELlen's extreme difficulty in acquiring knowledge,
compared with Ward's extraordinary quickness, only
confirmed her painful conviction of her great inferiority,
the impossibility of her ever winning love,-and the
consequent increased intensity of her affection for her
father and rather, who loved her notwithstanding.
That the child herself could not have opened these
sensations is true; but that they had existence,
even before she was nine years old, and that they
influence many years of her after-life, causing error
and suffering, and rendering Mrs. IIamilton's task
one of pain and difficulty, before these mistaken in-
florence could be eradicated, is equally so. The power
her early years is so immense, its responsibility sa
extensive, that its neglect or abuse may indeed make
the earnest thinker tremble ; less, perhaps, for the
actual amount of general evil, for that circumstances
in after life arc sometimes graciouasly permitted to

band might not care about thus exposing her to infer-
lion, but she really thought, for warmly's sake, it was
her duty to take care of herself. It might be nothing
to the Colonel or Ellen whether she liked or dick, but
to Edward it was a great deal; and so as she must
choose between them, she would go with him who loved
her best, and who would be miserable without her. The
haughty angry tone with which she spoke, the unjust
taunt, roused every indignant feeling, and Colonel
Forteseue said more in that moment of irritation than
he could have believed possible. But it only awakened
the cold sustaining pride which Languor always called
to her aid when conscience smote her, and she departed
with her son, hardening every better feeling and
rousing anger against her husband and child to con-
queer the suffering of self-reproach. ut when many

plaintive events of delirium with an acuteness of

planted a sense of a Father's infinite love and infinite
compassion within him, which was his sole sustainer
the short remainder of his life.
Languor's letters, few as they were, had in some

the intrinsic beauty of a disposition that, instead of
repining that she was left alone to suffer, could rejoice
that her brother had been spared.
Colonel kortescue obtained a few weeks' leave, that
he might take his child to the sea-side as recommended,
ere she joined her mother. And alone with him,
gradually regaining a moderate degree of strength,
Ellen was very happy; but such bright intervals were
indeed few and far between. There was no change
in her mother's contempt towards her, when reunited.
ller heart had, indeed, risen to her lips as she again
beheld the child so nearly lost; and had she followed
impulse, she would have clasped her in her arms and
wept over her, but that would have seemed tacitly
to acknowledge that she had been wrong, al had
suffered from it; and so she refrained, causing suffer-

husband, all from that fell demon pride. She only
chose to remember that it was Ellen who had been the
cause of her husband's anger-Ellen, the constant
subject of contention between them-Ellen, always
causing the pang of self-reproach: and so how as
it possible that she could love her?

not be exposed to its malaria; besides which, she had
promised him to go to a juenile ball, which was given
by an English family of rank in a fortnight's time,
and she could not possibly disappoint him; all why
her husband should wish for he in such a place she
could not imagine, but she knew she should die of
terror before she had been there a week. Not a word
did the Colonel utter in reply, but he felt as if an ice-
bolt had struck his heart and frozen it at once. 1He
fixed his eyes upon her, with a strange, sad, re-
proaching look, which haunted her till her death, and
turning from her, sought the room were Ellen was

her own youth were indeed renewed, the longings for
general admiration again her own; but now it was
only for her son, and her triumph was complete; many
and lovely were the yonthful things called together on
that festive night, seeming as if England ad concern-
treated her fairest and purest offspring in that far
distant land; but Edward, and his still lonely mother,
outshonc them all. That she was herself admired as

days of triumph, Languor scarcely knew; her every

wailing plaint and muffled runs, the military homage
 to somemighty dead. And if it were indeed but excited
fancy, it had a strange effect, for Languor fainted on the
marble floor.
That same afternoon Colonel Forteseue, with some
picked men, had set off to discover the track of some
marauding natives, who for some days had been of-
served hovering about the neighbourhood. Military
ardour carried him farther than he intended, and it
was nearly night, when entering a narrow defile, a
large body of the enemy burst upon them, and a des-
perate contest ensued. The lefile was so hemmed in
with rock and mountain, that though not very distant
from the for, the noise of the engagement had not
been distinguished. Captain Chamber was quietly sitting
with his wife and elder children, awaiting without any
Iorebodings the return of to Colonel. Though it was
late, Ellen's fears had been so visible, that MIss. Cartoon
could not send her to bed; the child seemed so rest-
less and uneasy that the Captain had trial to laugh her
out of lcr cowardice, as he called it, declaring that her
father would disown her if slc could not be more bare.
Hasty footsteps were at length herd approaching, and
Ellen started from her seat and sprung forwards, as the
door openly; but it was not the Colonel, only a scrgcant
who had necompanicl him, and whose face caused
Captain Camcron to exclaim, in alarm, `` KNow now,

The Captain started from his chair, but before he
could free another word, Ellen had caught hold of
the old man's arm, and wildly exclaimed, Do you
mean-do you mean-pray tell me, Sergeant Allen
-Hare the Natives met papa's troop, and hate they
fought ?-and-is he hurt-is he killed? The man
could not answer her-for her look and tone, he after-
wards declared to his comrades, went through his heart,
just for all the world like a sabre cut; and for the
moment neither Captain nor MRs. Cartoon could address
her. The shock seemed to hae banished voice from
all, one from the poor child principally concerned.
 Stay with me, my dear Ellen1'' MRs. Chamber at
length said, alraacing to her, as she still stool clinging
to the sergeant's arm; ``the Captain will go and meet
your father, and if he be wounded, we will nurse him
together, dearest Stay with me.''

to him, he may be before they bring him here, and 1
shall never feel his kiss or hear him bless me again. He
told me he should fall in battle-old Mrs. Chamber,

And they who knew all which that father was to his
poor Ellen could not resist that appeal. The Sergeant
said the Colonel was not dead, but so mortally wounded
they feared to move him. It was as fearful scene.

Ilis men lad removed him from the immediate scene of
slaughter, and tried to form a rough pallet of milk-
try cloaks, but the ghastly countenance, which the
noon's light rendered still more fixed and pallid, the
rigidity of his limbs, all seemed to deuote they had
indeed arrived too late, and that terrible stillness was
broken by the convulsel and passionate sobs of the
poor child, who flinging herself beside him, besought
him only to open his eyes, to look on her once more, to
call her his darling, and kiss her one, only once again:
and it seemed as if her voice had indeed power for the
moment to recall the fluttering soul. The head eyes
did unclose, the clenched hand relaxed to try and clasp
his child, and he murmured feebly-
How came you here, my poor darling Ellen? are

knelt down by him and convulsively pressed his hand,
but he could not speak.

to press his lips again on Ellen's cheek and brow, but
the effort was vain,-and at the very moment MRs.
Forteseue had stood transfixed by some unknown terror,
her husband cease to breathe.
It was long before Ellen rallied from that terrible
scene. Even when the fever which followed subsided,
and she had been taken, apparently perfectly restored
to health, once more to her mother and brother, its
recollection so haunted her, that her many lonely hours
became draught with intense suffering. Her imagination,
already only too morbid, dwelt again and again upon
the minutest particular of that field of horror: not only
her father, but the objects which, when her whole heart
was wrapped in him, she seemed not even to have seen.
The ghastly ears of dead, the severe limbs, the mangled
trunks, the gleaming faces all fixed in the distorted
expressions with which they died-the very hollow
groans and louder cry of pain which, as she passed
through the field, had fallen on her ear unheeel,
returned to the poor child's too early awakened fancy so
vividly, that often and often it was only a powerful though
almost unconscious effort that prevented the scream
of fear. Her father's last words were never forgotten;
she wouldn only continue to love her mother because
he had desired her to do so, but because He had so loved
her, and on her first return home this seemed easier
than ever to accomplish. MRs. Fortescue, torture by

and given vent to the warmth of her nature, Mrs.
PFovrtescue might have learned to know, and knowing, to
lore her-but it as then too late.
So torturing were MRs. Fortescue's feelings when she
recalled the last request of her husband, and her cruel
and haughty refusal; when that which had seemed so
important, a juenile ball-because not to go would
disappoint Edward-became associated with his fearful
death, and sunk into worse than nothing,-she had parted
with him in anger, and it proved for ever ;-that even
as England had become odious to her, love years
before, so did India now; and she suddenly resolved to
quit it, and return to the relatives she hal neglected so
long, but towards whom she now yearned more than
ever. She thought and believed such a complete change
would and must bring peace. Alas what chance will
remote the torture of remorse 
Though incapable of real love, from her studies
hcartlcessness, it was impossible for her to have lived
twelve years with one so indulgent and fond as Colonel
Fortescue, without renlizing some degree of affection,
and his unexpected an awful death roused every pre-
viously dormant feeling so powerfully, that she was
astonished at herself, and in her misery believed that
the feeling had only come to add to her burden-for
what was the use of loving now and determined to
rouse herself, she made eery preparation for immediate
departure, but she was painfully arrested. The selfish

and death; but she rallied, and insisted on taking her
passage for England some weeks before her meical
attendant thought it visible. The constant struggle
between the whisperings of good and the dominion of
evil, which her whole life had been, had unconsciously
determined a constitution naturally good; and when to
this was added a malignant disease, though grief in
itself, the seeds of a mortal complaint were planted,
which, ere the long voyage was concluded, had obtained
fatal and irremediable ascendeney, and oceasioned those
sufferings and death which in our first chapters we
described.
To Ward, though the death of his father had caused
im much childish grief, still more perhaps for sum-
path with the deep suffering of his mother, than a
perfect consciousness of his on heavy loss, the manner
in which he did was to him a source of actual pride.

fighting against superior numbers, and in the moment
of a glorious ictor. DIe had never seen death, and
imagined not all the attendant horrors of such one;
and how that Ellen would never even hear the word
without shuddering he could not understand, nor why
she should always so painfully shrink from the remotest
reference to that night, which was only associated in
his mind with emotions of pleasure. In the tedious
voyage of nearly six months (for five and twenty years
ago the voyage from India to England was not what it
is now,) the character of Edward shone forth in such

other colouring as almost to excuse his other's idolatry,
and win for him to regard of passengers and crew.
Captain Camcron had impressed on his mind that he
now stood in his father's place to his mother and sister;
and as the idea of protecting is always a strong innocent
to manliness in a boy, however youthful, Edward well
redeemed the charge, so devoting himself not only to his
mother, but to Ellen, that her affection for him redoubled,
as did her mistaken idea of his last superiority.

CHAPTER I
UUTIIEUL COLLOLYT-ITODCIG CHARACTER.
TE curtains were drawn close, the large lamp was
on the table, and a cheerful fire blazing in the grate;
for though only September, the room was sufficiently
large, and the evenings sulciently chill, for a fire
to add greatly to its aspect of true English comfort.
There were many admirable pictures suspendel on the
walls, and well-filled bookcases, asks, and maps, stands
of beautiful flowers, and some ingenious toys, all
seeming to proclaim the apartment as the especial
possession of the young party who were this evening
busily engaged at the large round table which occupied
the centre of the room. The were only four in
number, but what with a large desk pile with books
and some most alarming-sized dictionaries, which he-
cpiel the elder of the two lads, the embroidery frame
of the elder girl, the dissected map before her sister,
and two or three books scattered round the younger
boy, the table seemed so well filled, that Miss Harcourt
had quietly ensconced herself in her own private little
corner, sufficiently near to take an interest, and some-
times join in the conversation of her youthful charge:

enable her to pursue her own occupation of either
reading, writing, or working uninterruptedly.-Could

poor Mrs. Tortescue have glanced on the happy drop.
she certainly might have told her sister, with some
show of justice, that there was such an equal district-
lion of interesting and animated expression (which is the
great beauty of youth), that she could not have known
the trial of having such a heavy, dull, unhappy child
as Ellen. MRs. IIamilton indeed, we rather think would
not have considered such a trial, except as it proved
ill-health, and physical pain in the little suferer; and,
perhaps, her increased care and tenderness (for such
with her would have been the consequence of the
same cause which had created her sister's neglect)
might hae removed both the expression of constant
but imalpable illness, and the expression of heaviness
and gloom. Certain it is, her own IHerbert had, with
regard to delicate health, given her more real and con-
stand anxiety than Languor had her allowed herself to
experience with Ellen; hut there was nothing in the
boy's peculiarly interesting countenance to denote the
physical suffering he very often endured. Care and
love had so surrounded his path with blessings, that.
he was often heard to declare, that he never even
wished to be as strong as his brother, or to share his
time pleasures, he he so many others equally de-
lightful. Whether it was is physical temperament,
inducing a habitude of reflection and studious thought
much beyond his years, or whether the unusually gifted
mind worked on this frame, or the one combined to form
the other, it would be as impossible to decide with
regard to him as with hundreds of others like him;
but he certainly seemed, not only to his parents, but
to their whole household, and to every one who

casually associated with him, to have more in him
of even than earth; as if, indeed, he were only lent,
not given. And often, and often his mother's heart
ached with its very intensity of love, causing the
unspoken dread-how might she hope to retain one
so faultless, and yet so full of every human sympathy
and loel The delicate complexion, beautiful colour
of his cheeks and lips, and large, soft, very lark
blue eye, with its long black lash, high arched brow,
shaded by glossy cheanut hair, were all so lit up with
the rays of mind, that though his face returned again
and again to the fancy of those who had only once
beheld it, they could scarcely have recalled a single
feature, feeling only the almost angelic expression of
the whole.
His brother, as full of mirth and mischief, and as
noisy and laughter-loving as Herbert was quiet and
thoughtful, made his way at once, winning rear by
storm, and retaining it by his frank and generous
qualities, which made him as favourite with young and
old. Been in his hours of study, there was not the
least evidence of reflection or soberness. As a child
he had had much to contend with, in the way of pas-
soon, pride, and self-will; but his home influence hat
been such a judicious blending of indulgence and firm-
ness on the part of both his parents, such a persevering
inclination of a strong sense of duty, religious and
moral, that at fifteen his difficulties had been all nearly
overcome; and except when occasional acts of thought-
likeness and hasty impulse lured im into error and
its painful consequences, he was as happy and as good
a lad as en his anxious mother could desire

The elder of his two sisters resembled him in the
bright dark flashing eye, the straight intellectual brow,
the rich dark brown hair, and all-formed mouth;
but the expression was so different at present, that
it was often difficult to trace the likeness that actually
existed. IIaugltiness, and but too often ill-temper,
threw  shade over a countenance, which when happy
and animated was not only attractive then, but gave
fair promise of great scanty in after years. Te lis-
position of Caroline Milton was in fact naturally
so similar to that of her aunt MRs. Fortescue, that
Mrs. Hamnilton's task with her was not only more
difficult and painful in the present, than with any of
the others, but her dread of the future, at times so
overpowering that it required all her husband's influence
to calm her, by returning trust in Him, who had pro-
mixed to answer all who called upon Ilim, and would
bless that mother's toils which were based on, and
looked up alone, to Ilis influence on her child, and
guidance for herself.
The blue-eyed, fair-haired, graceful, little Emmeline,
not only the youngest of the family, but, from her slight
figure, delicate small features, and childish manner,
appearing been much younger than she was, was indeed
a source of joy and love to all, seeming as if sorrow,
except for others, could not approach her. She had
indeed much the required a carefully guiding man,
in a yielding weakness of disposition, indolent habit in
learning, an unrestrained fancy, and its general come-

indeed as for the vast capability of individual suffering
which such a disposition engendered, in those trials
which it was scarcely possible she might hope to pass
through life ithout. There was only one safeguard,
one unfailing comfort, for a character like hers, and
that was a deep ever-present sense of religion, which

Fortescue, who to both was such an eigma, and who
was seeingly in all things so utterly unlike their
Declined, was in natural disposition exactly the same
and that the vast difference in present and future
character, simply arose from the fact, that the early
influences of the one were sorrow and neglect, and of
the other, happiness and love.

interposed Perry, perceiving with regret the expression
of pain on his brother's face, and always ready to guard
him either from physical or mental suffering, feeling
instinctively that, from his extraordinary mind and vivid
sense of duty, he was liable to the latter, from many
causes which other natures would pass unnoticed.

Caroline's sentiments received encouragement, she would

the unrestrained expressions of affection, with which
by every one of the young pity they were received,
would have evinced it still more clearly. HErbert was
very speedily on his favourite sat, a low stool at his
mother's feet. Emmeline, for that one half hour at
least, assumed her still nresigned privilege, as the
youngest and kindest, to quietly slip in her lap; Percy
was talking to his father, making Edward perfectly at
home, saying may kind words to Ellen, nd caressing
is mother, all almost at the same moment. Caroline
was close to her father, with her arm round his neck;
and MIss IIarcourt was kindly disrobing Ellen from her
many wraps, and making her lie quietly on a sofa near
her aunt; who, even in that moment of delighted re-
union with her own, had yet time and taught, by a
few judicious words, to remove the undefinable but
painful sensation of loneliness which was creeping
over the poor child as she gazed on her bright, lamp-
looking cousins; and thought if to her own mother

more beloved than herself, what claim could she had

were the thoughts that filled her eyes with tears, and
made her heart so easy; she only knew that much
as she had loved her aunt during the journey, her kiss
and kind words at that moment made her love her
more than ever.
Never had there been a happier meal at Lowood
than the substantial tea which was speedily ready for
the travellers. So much was there to hear and tell;
Percy's wild sallies; Caroline'as animated replies (she
had now quite recovered her temper); Herhert's gentle
care of Ellen, by whom he had stationed himself (even
giving up to her his usual seat by his mother),
Emmeline's half shy, half eager., efforts to talk to her
cousin; Mr. and Mrs. HIamilton's earnest interest,
all combined, long before the meal was concluded, to
make Ward feel perfectly at his ease, and very happy,
and greatly to remove Ellen's unacknowlelged dread.
The time passed so quickly, that there was a general
start when the prayer hell sounded, though it was
nearly two hours after the usual time.

Milton asked of IIerbert, as they rose to adjourn to

completely bewildered him. He had always fancied

it was so incomprehensible the servants all joining

began to think seriously himself, he felt diffident and
uncertain of his own powers, and so left an impression
more of we towards the subject than of love, while
to a disposition such as ellen's was unfortunate.
A very short time sufficed for Perry and Emmeline
to introduce their cousins to all the delights and
mysteries of their dear old home: and Oakwood All
was really a place for imagination to revel in. It was
a large castellated mansion, draught with both the
associations of the past, and the comforts of the pre-
sent. The injuries which the original mansion had
received during the civil war of Charles I, had, when
the family returned at the Restoration, caused much of
the old house to be pulled down, nd replaced it
larger rooms, and greater convenience for a modern
dwelling-house, retaining, however, quite sufficient of
the past to throw interest around it.
The wings were still flanked with turrets, which ere

cases, leading into all sorts of nooks and corners,
-and the small and most uncomfortable room, be-
cause some of them happened to be hung with tapestry,
and had those small narrow windows sunk in deep
recesses,-were pronounced by both far more enjoyable
than the beautiful suite of rooms forming the centre of
the mansion, and the dwelling of the family. Tales
were only saved from being diaagreeably modern-Percy
would declare-by their beautiful richly-polished oaken
panels, and by the recesses which the large windows

broad carved oaken balustrade, leading to a gallery
above, which opened on the general sleeping apart-
meats, and thus permitting the full height of the
mansion, from base to roof, to be visible from the
hall. The doors visible in the gallery opened mostly
on dressing-rooms, or private sitting-rooms, which led
to the large airy sleeping-rooms, to which the servants
hal access by back stairenses leading from their hall;
and so leaving the oaken staircase and gallery entirely
to the use of the family, and of many a game of noisy
play had that gallery been the scene. There had been
a beautiful little chapel adjoining the mansion, but it
was mercilessly burnt to the ground by the infatuated
Puritans, and never restored; the venerable old
church of the village henceforth serving the family of
the Ill.
Situated on the banks of the Dart, whose serpcntine
windings gave it the appearance of a succession of
most lovely lakes, Nature had been so lavisl of her
beauties in the garden and park, especially in the man-
nificent growth of the superb oaks, from which the
estate took its me, that it was not much wonder
MIss. IIamilton, always an intense lover of Nature, should
ve come so attached to her home as never to feel
the least inclination to leave it. Shoe did not wish her

always looked, as demanding from her part of the years

terest; and many acquaintances who would have visited
more than she felt any inclination for, had she not had
the happy power of quietly pursuing her own path, and
yet conciliating all.
The le, William TOwards had accepted Mr. IIamilton's
eagerly-proffered invitation to become his rector, and
undertake the education of his boys, from very peculiar
circumstances. DIe had been minister of a favourite
church in one of the southern towns, and master of an
establishment for youths of high rank, in both which
capacities he had given universal satisfaction. The
reprehensible conduct of some of is pupils, carried on
at first so secretly as to elude his knowledge, at length
became so notoriout as to demand examination. He
had at first refused all credence, but when proved, by
the confused replies of all, and all confession of some,
he briefly and emphatically laid before them the enormity
of their conduct, and declared, that as confidence was
entirely broken between them, he would resign the
honour of their education, refusing to admit them any
longer as members of his establishment. In vain the
young men implored him to spare them the disgrace of
such expulsion; he was inexorable.
This conduct, in itself so upright, was painted by the
smarting oleanders in such colours, that MIr. TOwards
gradually but surely found his school abandoned, and
himself so misrepresentet, that a spirit less self-post-
passed and secure in its own integrity must have sunk
beneath it. But he had some true friends and none
more active and earnest than MIr. IIamilton. A very
brief residence at Lowood Rectory removed even the
recollection of the injustice he had experienced, and he

of trial came, weakness and false indulgence so tired-
minute, that Ashamed, to counteract these evil influ-
eyes, adopted a contrary extreme, and, by a system of
constant reserve and security, became an object of as
much terror to his children as he was to his wife. bUt
he did not pursue this conduct without pain, and never
did he visit Oakwood without bitter regret that his
home was not the same.
MIr. and MRs. IIamilton had often tried to alter the
aspect of affairs at MIoorlands,-the former, by entreat
ing Ashamed to be less severe; the latter, by urging
Lady HElen to a firmer made of conduct, But those
friendly efforts were as yet entirely useless. Ashamed
became a member of Parliament, which took his family
to London for five or six months in the year-a parting-
early agreeable change to Lady Helen, who then associated
with her sisters, whose families were conducted much
on the same fashion as her own, but unfortunately
only increasing the discomfort of MIoorlands when they
returned to it. And this was the more to be regretted,
from the act that both Grandam and his wife were full
of good intentions, and had the one been more yield-
in, and the other more firm, there might have been no
small share of happiness for bath.
But heavy as Lady Silent thought her trial in the
want of her husband's confidence and love, and which
she had greatly brought upon herself, it was light in come-

both her children, and still more forcibly, when they
became old enough to observe, by example than hy pre-

hopelessness as to the fruit of her anxious labours, had
she not possessed that clinging, single-hearted trust
which taught her that no difficulty should deter from a
simple duty, and that nothing as too hard for Him
who-if He saw that she shrunk not from the charge
and responsibility which, in permitting her to become
a mother, He had given, and did all she could to count-

had no power-would, in His own good time, reward,

TE part of the day which to Emmeliue Milton
was the happiest of all, was that in which she and
Caroline, and now, of course, Ellen, were with their
mother alone. Not that she particularly like the very
quiet employment of plain work, which was the thing
usual occupation, but that she could talk without the
least restraint either about her lessons, or her pleasures,
or her thoughts, and the stories or histories se had
been reading, and if she thought wrong no one ever
corrected her so deligltfully and impressivrely as
 Mamma.'' The mornings, from three to four hours,
according as their age and studies required, were always
under the control of MIss Harcourt, with such visits
from MIss. Milton as gave an increased interest to ex-
person, and such interruption only as permitted their
practice and lessons in sic, which three times a week
MRs. AMbition and as yet herself bestowed. The
dressing-bell always rung at half-past three, and dinner
was at four, to allow the lads' return from Mr.
Howar's, whose daily lessons commenced at nine and
concluded at three. From half-past one to half-past

walking, or rising, and in the longer, to Emmeline's
favourite time-an hour at work with her mother, and

rises for the next day, which in the winter occupied
from fie to six. From six to seen in the same gone-
rally gloomy season they read aloud some entertaining
back with their mother and Miss Harcourt, and seen
was the delightful hour of a general reunion at tea, and
signal for such reereation till nine as they felt inclined
for; their brothers having been employed for MIr
Howard part of the time between dinner and te, with
sufficient earnestness to enjoy the rest and recreation
afterwards, quite as buoyancy and gladly as their
sisters, and many a merry never enlivened their winter
evenings.
In the summer, of course, this daily routine was
frequently varied by most delightful excursions in the
country. MRs. Milton earnestly longing to implant
a love of Nature and all its fresh pure associations in
the minds of her children while yet young, knowing that
one obtained, the pleasures of the world would he far
less likely to obtain too powerful dominion. That which
the world often terms romance, she felt to be a high
pure sense of poetry in the Universe and in Man, which
she was quite as anxious to instil as many mothers te
root out. She did not believe that to cultivate the
spiritual needed the banishment of the matter of fact;
but she believed, that to infuse the latter with the former
would he their best and surcst preventive against all
that was low and mean; their best help in the realiza-
lion of a constant unfailing piety. For the same reason
she cultivated a taste for the beautiful, not only in her
girls, hut in her boys-and beauty, not in arts and
Nature alone, but in character. She did not allude to

lowly virtues, struggles, faith, and heroism in the poor-
their forbearace and kindness to one another-marking
something to admire, been in the most rugged and surly,
that at first sight would seem so little worthy of notice.
It was gradually and almost unconsciously, to accustomed
her daughters to such a train of thought and sentiment,
that she so particularly laid aside one part of the way to
have them with her alone ; ostensibly, it was to give part
of their day to working for the many poor, to whom
gifts of ready-made clothing are sometimes much more
valuable than money ; but the education of that one hour
she knew might, for the right cultiation of the heart,
do more than the more feeling of five or six, and that
education, much as settled and value MIss IIareourt,
she had from the first resolved should come from her
alone.
To Emmeline tis mole of life was so happy, she
could not imagine anything happier. But Caroline often
and often denied her great friend Annie Ashamed, and
believed that occasional visits to London would make her
much happier, than remaining all the year round at
Lowood nd only with her own family. She knew
the expression of such sentiments would meet no sun-
path at home, and certainly not obtain their gratiiication,
so she tried to check them, except when in company
with Annie and lady lIttle; but her mother knew them,
and from the discontent and unhappiness they so often
cngentdered in her child, caused her both pain and
Incasiness. But she did not waver in her plans, because
only in Emmeline they seemed to succeed: nor did she,
s perhaps some her-scrupulous mothers would hae

done, check Carolinc's association with MIss Ashamed.
She knew that those principles must be indeed of little
worth, which would only estate in retirement, and when
tree from temptation. That to prevent intimacy with
all, except with those of whom she exactly approved,
would be impossible, if she ever meant her daughters to
enter the world; and therefore she endeavoured so to
obtain their unrestrained confidence and affection, as to
be regarded both now, and when they were young
women as their first, best, and truest friend, and that
end obtained, intimacies with their young companions,
however varied their character, she felt would do na
permauent harm.
 Dear, dear MAnner'' exclaimed Emmeline, one
morning about a week after her parents' return, and
dropping her work to speak more eagerly, ``you cannot
think how delightful it does seem to have you at home
again; I missed this our of the by so very much; i
did not know how much I locked when I always had it,
but when you were away, every time the hour came I
missed you, and longed for you so much the-i am

 Oh, how Percy must have laughed at you, Emmy.''

HOME SILENCE.
I did not miss fLamma after the first, quite so much
as you did, Emmeline,'' replied her sister, ingenuously;
``because when Lady Helen returned from London, she
made me go there so often, and as I know you never
refuse to that indulgence, MAmma, and Miss IIarcourt
did not object, I was glad to do so.''
I have only one objection, my dear Caroline, and I
think you know what that is.''
That whenever I am with Annie I think and wish
more about going to London, MAmma, I am afraid 1
do; but indeed I try to think that you must know what
is better for me, and try not to be discontented, though
sometimes I know I do not succeed,'' and her eyes filled
with tears.

your most trifling conquest of self is a great source of
comfort to me. I myself should feel that the pain of

could in conquering its constant aeeompaniment, ill
temper, would more than balance the pleasure of Annie's
society, and so not indulge in the one so often at the
expense of the other; but of that you are yourself the
best judge, and you know in such a case l always permit
you to be a free agent. 3ut what has become of Mary,
Emmeline ? I begged MRs. Greville tolet you be as much

society afford you some pleasure?'
 Oh, yes, MAmma, a great deal; but unfortunately
MIr. Greville was at home almost all the time you were

Seville and Mary must both feel still more comfort-

hear the cruel things he says. Oh, low I do wish 1
could make poor Mary more happy.''
 She would tell you that affection is a great comfort
to her, SOlemn.''
 Yours and Herbert's may be, Mamma, because you
are both so much better and wiser than I am; but I can
do so little, so very little.''
 You can be and are a great source of interest to her,
my dear; and when we wish very much to make another
person happy, you may be quite sure that the most
trifling act girls pleasure; but Ellen looks very much
as if she would like to know who this MAry is, that is so
tried-suppose you tell her.''
Emmeline eagerly obeyed, painting her friend in fuel
going colours, that Ellen felt, however true height
be, a person so good and holy must be happy notwith-
standing; besides, to be loved so by MRs, IIamilton and
Herbert, discovered to her mind such superior qualities,
that she almost wondered how Emmeline could speak of
her so familiarly, and think of her as her own particular
friend. But the conversation on her and then on other
topics so interest her, that she was host as sorry as
her cousin, when it was interrupted by a visit from Lady
Helen Ashamed and her daughter.

former's lively greeting, and evening far more warmth

I rather think the change of season, and not my
absence, has been the cause of these melancholy facts,''
replied MRs. HIamilton, in the same tone; 'but even
London will not change your kind thought for me,
Helen.''
Nay, I must follow the example of my neighbour,
rich and poor, whom you may appeal to as to the fact
of your absence causing terrible lamentation; ask this
naughty little girl too, who scarcely ever came to see

she glanced on the deep morning of her friend, and
indeed of all the group;  what a cold, hcartless being

with as with Caroline and Emeliue,'
The young lady turned round at the words, but her
sole notice of eLlen, who had come timidly forward, was
a haughty sure, a fashionable course, and a few
nintelligible words, which paused Emmeline to feel so
indignant, that it was with difficulty she kept silence,

more than her usual shyness, she received Lady lInley's

Ellen might have found courage to reply, for there
was an interest attached to all who had known her
mother; but as she raised her eyes to speak, she again
encountered Annie's rude and disagreeable stare, and
the words died on her lips. The young party were,
however, soon all in the garden, for Mrs. Milton
never made any scruple in dismissing her children,
when she wished to speak on subjects she did not
choose them to her; and she was anxious so to related
Languor's illness and change of sentiment, as to remove
the impressions which her early career had left on

Caroline Milton (who was nearly thirteen), but from
having been emancipatel from the nursery and school-
room at a very early age, and made her mother's come-

pretty and engaging,-she was very much noticed, and
her visits to her titled relations in London, hy causing
her to imitate their fashionable manners, terms of
speech, thoughts on dress, and rank, c., made her a
woman many years before her time; and though to Lady
Miller's family and to Lay Helen herself this made her
till more agreeable, from becoming so very companion-
able, to MRs. IIamilton, and to all, in fact, who loved
childhood for childhood's sake it was a source of real
regret, as banishing all the restless and nrtlessness
and warmth which ought to have been the characteristics
of her age. Her father was the only one of her own
family who did not admire-and so tried to check-this

Milton as her favourite friend. Why, she could not
exactly tell, except that it was so very delightful to have
some one in the country to whom she could dilate on
all the pleasures of London, display her new dresses,
new music, drawings, work, &c. (not however consider-
in it at all necessary to mention that her work and
drawings were only half her own, and Caroline was
much too truthful herself to imagine it, and her mother
too anxious to retain that guileless simplicity to an-
lightcn her, as she was well capable of doing). Annie's
quick eye discovered that at such times Caroline her-
vainly envied her, and she imagined she must be a
person of infinite consequence to excite such a feeling,
and this was such a pleasant sensation, that she sought
Caroline as much as possible during their stay at MOor-
lands. O MRs. Milton, indeed, she stood in such
comfortable awe, though that lady never addressed

intimacy with Caroline, whom she had determined
should be as unlike her mother as possible, and as this
friendship as the only one of his daughter's sentiments
which gave MIr. Grnhnme unmixed satisfaction, he
encouraged it by bringing them together as often as he
could.
Declined and Ellen meanwhile had pursued their

make her feel it. And as they came in sight of her
and Caroline, he called out to Ellen, who, all her

annoyed her quite as much as he desired.
Ward's hasty progress to his aunt was slightly
checked at seeing a stranger with her, but when he was
introduced, he made his bow with so much of his
mother's grave, that, combined with the extraordinary
likeness, and her feelings already interested in Mrs.

A rEr lays more brought Its. Reilly and Mary
to welcome their friends, and Ellen had again the pain
of being introduced to strangers; but this time it was
only the pain of her own shyness, for could she have
overcome that feeling, she might have felt even pleasure.
As it was, the gentle voice and manner with which
MIss. Reilly addressed her, and the timid yet desire-
give glance of Mary, told of such sympathy and kind-
ness, that she felt attracted towards both, and could
quite enter into Emmeline's enthusiastic admiration of
her friend; not, however, relieving it possible that
she herself could ever be worthy to in Mary's regard.
Taught from such a very early age to believe herself so
far inferior to Edward, such characters as IIerbert and
MAry appeared to her so exalted, that it was quite
impossible they could her think of her; the constant
little acts of unobtrusive kindness that her cousin
showed her, she attributed to his extreme goodness, not
from the most trifling merit in herself. She did indeed
love him very denrly, the best nest to her aunt; but
so much of reverence mingled with it, that she was
almost more reserved with him than with the others.

Ten contrasting MAry Greville with Annie Ashamed,
as she was rather fond of doing, Lmmeline became so
afraid she was disliking the latter more than she ought
to do, that she near rested till she made an upper-
tunity to confess all her feelings to her mother, and
beg her to tell her if they were very wrong, and if she
ought to like her.
I am not so nconscionable as to expect you t
like every one with whom you associate, my dear little
girl,'' replied her mother, fondly, for there was some-
thing in Emmeline's guileless confidence irresistibly
claiming love.,  All we have to do when we find no-
thing that exactly sympathize with our own feelings,
or our own ideas of right and wrong, is to try and find
out some reason for their being so different; some
circumstance that may have exposed them to greater
temptations and trials, for you know I have often told
you pleasure and amusements, if too much indulged in,
are a much greater trial to some than sorrow and pain.
Now Annie has had a great many more temptations of this
kind than you or Mary, and we cannot expect one so
very young entirely to resist them,''
Do you mean, MAnage, her going out so much in
London ?
Yes, love; she is very much noticed, and so perhaps
thinks a little too much of appearance and dress und
pleasure than is quite necessary.''
But Lady HElen need not take her out so much if
she did not like. Do you think she is quite right to do
so?'' asked Emmeline, very thoughtfully.

ONE 1INFLUENCE.
 We mustn pronouuce judgment on other people's
action, my little girl. I think it better not to interrupt
your present quiet and I hope happy life, and there
fore I do not take you or Caroline to LOndon; but
Mr. Ashamed is obliged to be there for several months,
and Lady Helen very naturally would not like to be
separated either from him or her children. And then
she has such a large family and Annie so many young
relations, that you see Lady WHile could not keep her
children quite as free from temptation as I do mine,
and we should be more sorry for Annie than blame her
individually, however we may not like her faults.
Do you understand me, my dear?''
Oh, yes, Mamma, and I am so glad I took courage
to tell you all I felt. I am afraid I have encouraged
many unkind thoughts about her, and I am quite sorry
ow, for I see she cannot help them as much as I
thought she could. I do not think I could ever make
her my friend, but I will try very much not to dislike
and avoid her,''
And that is all that is required of you, my lore.
When I tell you that our Father in Heaven commands
us to love one another, and to avoid all unkindness in
thought and dead, I do not mean tlt Ill desires us to
love all alike, because DIe knew it would be neither for
our happiness nor good that it should be so, but only
to prevent the too great influence of prejudice nudl
dislike. We might think such feelings can do no
harm, because only confined to our own minds, but
they would be sure gradually to lead us to taking plea-
sure in listening to their lispraise, and joining in it, and
to seeing and talking only of their faults, forgetting

that if we had been circumstanced exactly as they are.
we might have been just the same; and this is the
feeling said condemns in one of the ksalms we read
this morning. Are you tired of listening some, dearest,
or shall we read it over again together?''
Declined's only answer was to run eagerly for her
little Bible, and with loving cheeks and sparkling
eyes listen to her mother, as she turned to the fifteen
Palm, and reading it through, particularly pointed out
the third else, and so explained it, is easily and
happily to satisfy her child as to the Divine authority
for all that she had said, and to stamp them still more
forcibly on her memory.
`And now I do not mean to talk to you any more,
my darling,'' she said, kissing the little earnest face
upturned to hers.  You have heard quite enough to
think about, and I am sure you will not forget it, so
go and play; Ellen must be wondering what has be-
come of you.'' And again full of glee, the happy child
bounded away, exclaiming, as she lie so, `for Annie,
I am glad I am not exposed to such temptations, for
I am sure I should not be able to resist them either''
But though any one who had seen her the next half
hour might have fancied that a serious thought or
sober ask could not approach er, neither the con-
question nor te soul was forgotten; with IIorbert's
explanatory assistance, she not only found the 'calm,

require a great effort on her part to retain them. The

making her understand that in time of study she re-

Caroline to relax in her efforts, thinking she had done
quite enough, and perniciously increasing her already

the most powerful inccntie to a continuance in im-

There was constantly a read on the mother's hurt,

She was watching with delight Emmeline's un-
restrained enjoyment of her father's cnresses and lively
conversation, in which Percey as usual joined-for
Tiny, as he chose to call her, was his especial pet and
plaything-when she was startled by low and evidently
suppressed sob near her; Ellen was bending over a book
of Billy-stories while Herbert had left her, and hearing
ringlets completely concealed her face; Miss HInrcout
and Caroline both looked up surprised, but a rapid sign
from MIss. Hanilton presented their making any remark.
Herbert fixed his eyes pityingly on his little cousin, as
if wishing but not liking to dress her. Edward was
the only one of the party who moved. He was busily
engaged examining a large Noah's ark, and speculating
as to its resemblance to a ship and its powers of floating,
but after a few minutes' apparent thought he left it, and
sitting down on Ellen's chair, put his arm round her,
and begged her to find a picture of Noah's ark, and see
if it were at all like the toy. Cleared by his affection,
she conquered with a strong effort the choking in her
throat, and turned to the page, and tried to sympathise
in his wonder if it really were like the vessel in which
Coal was said, and where he could have put all the
animals. MRs. IHarilton joined them, and without
taking more notice of Ellen's very pale cheeks and heavy
eyes, than gently to put back the thick tresses that
seemed to annoy her with their weight, gave them so
much interesting information on the subject, and so
delighted Her with allowving im to rag down several
books from the library, to find out all they said about

walk in grand procession to their temporary dwelling.
ut MRs. IIamilton didn forget the child's involun-
try evidence of suffering, and vainly tried to imagine
what at that moment could have cause it. IIerbert
seemed to think about it too, for the next day she heard
him ask Heart-
If he knew why his sister always looked so sad?
if i thought it was because she was not yet reconciled
to Oakwoolt
It is not that,'' was Edward's reply: `she has a-
ways looked and seemed sad, as long as cAn remember
er. One reason may be, she was always ill in India,
and Papa was often telling me how very much she
suffered, and how patiently she bore it; and then, too,
she knew I was poor mamma's favourite (his voice
trembled), and used to make her very unhappy ; but I do
not know why she is so very sad now, unless she is ill
again, and that no one can tell, for she never will
complain.''
 Was your sister such a constant sufferer than ''
inquired his aunt. Come here, and tell me all you
can about her, Edward. I wish I could know more of
both your lives in lIndia.''
Edward with eager willingness communicated all he
new, though, from his being so constantly with his
mother, and Ellen so much left to her father and herself,
that all was little enough; adding, however, that after
her cry dangerous illness, when she was eight years
old, he perfectly well remembered hearing some cell-
rather physician say to his father she would probably
feel te effects of it all her life.

`It was a very long time before MAmma permitted me
to see her,'' added Edward, ``and when I did, I seem-
her being almost frightened, she was so altered, so pale,
and thin and weak; and then she was very ill after poor
Papa's death ; but since then she has never complained,
and never kept her bed; but I know she is often in
pain, for when I have touched her forehead sometimes,
it has burnt my hand like fire.'
THis childish explanation certainly told Mrs. IIamilton
more than she had known before; but that Ellen had
witnessed the fearful scene of her father's death was
still concealed. World, as he grew older, though he
did not know why, seemed to shrink from the subject,
particularly that he had been at a ball the same awful

A few days afterwards, as MRs. IIamilton was crossing
the large hall on her way to the school-room-for so,
spite of Percy's determination that it should receive the
more learned and refined appellation of studio, it was
still called-she overheard Caroline's voice, exclaiming,
in angry impatience-
` Indeed, I shall not, I have enough to do with my
own lessons, without attending to other people's. It is
your idleness, ellen, not the difficulty of your lesson;
for I am sure it is easy enough.''

reply. `` She is not idle, and I am sure her lesson is
not so easy; I wish I could explain it properly.''

Caroline had already quitted the room, and in her

contrary she had left her, she felt it almost disrescct

persisting too in her own headstrong idea that it was
ill-temper not illness which rendered Ellen so disagee-
able, she would not stoop so to conquer her unfortunate
pride as to ask such a favour of her relatives, and to
whom else could she appeal ? Colonel Fortescue had
one but distant cousins. She did satisfy a qualm of
conscience by once suggesting to her husband-was her
own idea, however, not as that of an experienced ph-
social-that as he fancied Ellen was always ill, she
might be better in England; but, as she expected, not
only his intense love for his little girl rose up against the
idea of separation, but his pride reolted from sending
her to claim the pity of relatives who had so completely
cast off her parents: yet had he been told it was also-
lately necessary for her health and so greatly for her
happiness, he would not have hesitated to sacrifice every
thought of self. But Languor, satisfied that she had

others; and so weak sometimes, that tears start at the
first harsh or unkind world, and they are thought cross,
when they do not in the least feel so; and this not for
a few weeks, but with few exceptions, the trial of months
and even years.
And this was Ellen's-which not even the tenderest
and most unfailing care of her aunt could entirely guard
her from. It is a most difficult thing for those who
are strong and healthy themselves to understand and
always bear with physical suffering in others. MIss
Hareourt, though in general free from anything like
prejudice, and ardently desirous to follow up her own
and MRs. IIamilton's ideas of right and wrong, could
not so tavern her affection as to feel the same towards
Ellen as she did towards Ward and the children she
had lived with and taught so long. Her task with Ellen
required more patience and forhearance and care than
with either of the others, and sometimes she could not
help believing and acting towards her as if it were wilful
idleness and carelessness, not the languor of disease.

of such a remarkably-gifted mind, and so bright in
aspect, so sweet in temper, that illness seemed to
have spiritualized instead of deadened every faculty.
She could not understand as MRs. IIamilton did, the
force of circumstances in producing from nearly the
same cause two such different effects, nor how it was
that complete neglect had engendered more eils than
indiscreet indulgence: but that it appeared to have
done so, was happily only too evident not only to
Miss Harcourt but to MRs. Milton. It seemed almost
surprising, and certainly a proof of a remarkably good
disposition, that Edward appeared so free from great
faults, and of such a warm, generous, frank, and see-
ingly unselfish nature, so open to conviction, and to all
good impressions, that, except occasional fits of violent
passion, there really was, as far as his aunt and uncle
could perceive, nothing to complain of. They did not
know that he stood in such awe of MIr. IIamilton, from
his mother's lessons of his exceeding sternness, that
he exercised the greatest control over himself; and he
was so excessively fond of MIr. Coward, and his days
glided by in such varied and delightful employment,
that there was no temptation to do wrong; except certain
acts of trifling disobedience, of more consequence from
the self-will they betrayed than the acts themselves,
but which might have been source of anxiety to his
aunt, and lessened her confidence in him had she known
them; but she did not, for ellen not only constantly
concealed, but was the sufferer for him, and so brought
reproof and suspicion on herself, which, could the truth
have been known, might hacbeen averted. But truth

of net as well as word had never been impressed on
Edward; and, therefore, though he was constitutionally
too brave to utter a falsehood, too houorahle to shield
himself at the expense of another, if he knew that other
suffered, he had been too long taught to believe that
Ellen was his inferior, and must always give up to him,
to imagine that he was ever eating deccitfully or unman-
fully in permitting her to conceal his acts of disobedience.
There was so much to love and admire in Edward,
that neither MIr. nor MRs. milton imagined the real
weakness of his character-that those lovenble qualities
all sprung from natural impulse, sustained by any-
thing like principle. The quickness and apparent for-
our with which he received the religious impressions

the short time that was allowed them before he entered
the nay, they laughed so hopeful from, that not only
his reception and uncle, but his ever anxious aunt, looked
forward to his career with scarcely a doubt as to its
purity and honour.
Ellen caused her infinitely more anxiety. There was
a disregard to truth, a want of openness and canlour,
which, though Mrs. IIamilton believed the etects of
neglect and extreme timidity, both her husband and Miss
IIareourt feared were natural MIne indeed sprung
from the poor child's mistaken idea of the nature and
solemnity of the promise she had made her the, und

principle, ta enable her so to conquer herself as to speak
the truth, even if she suffered from it. It was only
indeed in extreme cases of fear-and never to her father
that she had ever spoken falsely; but to Mrs. IIamilton's
high principles, which by extreme diligence and care
she had as suecessfully imparted to her own children,
been coucealrent was often an acted untruth, and of
this fault and equivocation Ellen was but to often
guilty: exciting MIss Harcourt's and Caroline's pre-
judices yet more against her. The latter with all her
faults never swerved from the rigid truth, and had a
strong contempt and dislike towards all those who did-
except her friend Annie, who, as she always took care to
speak the truth to her, she did not suspect of being less
careful than herself. Emmeline, who had had some stiff-
could in restraining her love of exaggeration, and also
in so conquering her own timidity and fear as always to
speak the truth, only pitied Ellen, but did not love her
the less.
Of course it was not till some months had passed that

and in the opinions they called forth in those around
them, could be discovered: but notwithstanding she
stood almost alone inner opinion, notwithstanding there
was very little outward evidence that she was correct,

CHAPTER I
137
A LONG EATING IN  P1SSION.-A WALl.-
A 8SCENE OF DI9THE3S.
OF very fine morning in May, Mrs, Milton invited
Ward to join her in a walk, intending also to call at
Moorlands and Gresille MInor on their way. The
Lads were released for a few days from their attendance
on MIr. FOrward, that gentleman having been sum-
moved on some clerical business to lExzeter. Percy as
to account his father on an equestrian excursion;
IIerbert had been commissioned by Emmeline some
days before to take some books to MAry Seville, and
had looked forward himself to spending a morning with
her. Edward, delighted at being selected as his aunt's
companion, prepared with haste and glee for his curls-
soon. Robert was, however, unfortunately not at hand
to give him a clean pair of shoes (he had already spoiled
two pair that morning by going into the stream which
ran through the park to sail a newly-rigged fringe),
and angry at the delay, fearing that his aunt would not
wait for him, he worked himself into such a silent pas-
sign, that when Robert did appear he gave went to more
abusive language than he had ever yet ventured to use,
concluding by hurling both his discardedl shoes at the
domestic, who only escaped a severe blow by starting
aside, an permitting them to go through the window.
158

 Robert, leave the room: I desire that you will not
again gie your assistance to MAster lortescue till he
knows how to ask it,'' was MRs. iIamilton's most
unexpected interference, and Edward so started at her
voice and look, that his passion was suddenly opened.
'Finish your toilette, and when you have found your
shoes and put them away, you May join me in the
breakfast-room, Edward. I only wait your pleasure,''
And her lid Edward leave her presence more gladly.
Shame had suddenly conquered anger, and, though his
chest still heaved and his checks were still Rushed, he
did not utter another word till nearly a quarter of
mile on their walk. Twice he had looked up in his
aunt's face as if about to speak, but the expression as
so very grave, that he felt strangely afraid to proceed.
At length he exclaimed-
 You are displeased with me, dear Aunt; but indeed
I could not help feeling angry.''
I am still more sorry than displeased, Edward;
I had hoped you were learning more control, and to
know your duty to a domestic better. Your uncle-''
Oh, pray do not tell him'' implored Edward, ``and
I1 will ask Robert's pardon the moment I go home.''
I certainly shall not complain of you to him,
Wanted, if my arguments can coniuce you of your
error; but if you are only to ask Robert's pardon for
fear of your uncle, I would rather you should not i
so. Tell me the truth; if you were quite sure you
uncle would know nothing about it, would you still ask
Robert's pardon?'
Edward unhesitatingly answered  N '
And why not?

159
 Because I think he ought to ask mine for keeping
me waiting as he did, and for being insolent first to
me.''
 SHe did not keep you waiting above five minutes,
and that was my fault not his, as I was employing him;
and as for insolenee, can you tell me what he said
Edward hesitated.
I do not remember the exact words, but I know he
called me impatient, and if I were, he had a right to
tell me so.''
Nor did he. I heard all that passed, and I could
not help thinking how very far superior was Robert, a
poor country youth, to the young gentleman who
abuse him.''
The colour rose to Edward's temples, but he set his
teeth and clenched his hand, to prevent any farther
display of anger; and his aunt, after attentively of-
serving him, continued-
 He said that his young master Perc never required
impossibilities, and though often impatient never abused
him. You heard the word, and feeling you had been
so, believed he applied it to yourself.''
 bUt in what can he be my superior?'' asked Edward,
in a low voice, as if still afraid his passion would regain
ascendeney.
I ill answer your question by another, Edward.

and contemptuously desires you to get out of their
sight, how could you have answered ?''
I would have struck him to the earth,'' replied
Edward, passionately, and quite forgetting his wished-

for control. Neither equal nor superior should dare
speak so to me again.''
`And what prevented Robert acting in the same
manner? Do you think he has no feeling ?-that he
is incapable of such emotions as pain or anger ?''
Edward stood for a minute quite still and silent.
I did not think anything about it,'' he said at
length; ` but l certainly supposed I had a right to say
what I pleased to one so far beneath me,''
: And in what is robert so far beneath you ?''
 He is a servant and I am a gentleman; above him
in birth, rank-''
Stop, Edward did you make yourself a gentleman
Is it any credit to you individually to e higher in the
world, and receive a better education than Robert ?'
Edward was again silent, and his aunt continued to
talk to him so kindly yet so earnestly, that at length
he exclaimed-
I feel I have indeed been wrong, dear Aunt; but
what can I do to prove to Robert I am really sorry for
having treated him so ill ?'
 re you really sorry, Edward, or do you only say
this for fear of your uncle's displeasure ?''
 Indeed, I hal quite forgotten him,'' replied Edward,
earnestly; I desire his anger, and would willingly
expose myself to it, if it would redeem my fault,''
I would rather see you endeavour earnestly to
restrain your passions, my dear boy, than inflict any
such pain upon you. It will be a great pleasure to me
if you can really so conquer yourself as to apologise to
llohert; and I think the pain of so doing will enable

you more easily to remember all we have been saying, than
if you weakly shrink from it. The life you have chosen
makes me even more anxious that you should become
less passionate-than were you to remain longer with
me;-I fear you will so often suffer seriously from it.''
I1 very often make resolutions ever to be in a
passion again,'' returned Elwnrl, sorrowfully ; `` but
whenever anything process me, something seems to
me in my throat, and I am compelled to give way.''
yOu will not be able to conquer your felt, my
dear Ward, without great perseverance; but remember,
the more difficult the task, the greater the reward; and
that you can control anger I have, been during our
walk, had a proof.''
Edward looked up surprised.
 Did you not feel very angry when I said Robert
as our superior ?'
Yes,'' replied Edward, blushing deeply.
5' And yet you successfully checked your rising
passion, for fear of offending me. I cannot be always
near you; but, my dear to, you must endeavour to
remember that lesson I have tried to teach you so often
--that you are never alone. You cannot even think as
angry thought, much less speak an abusive word and
commit the most trifling act of passion, without offleuding
Go. If you would but ask for Ilis help, and recollect
that to offend Him is far more terrible than to incur
the displeasure of either your uncle or myself, I think
you would find your task much easier, than if you
attempted it, trusting in your own strength alone, and
only for fear of man.''
Edward did not make any reply, but his countenance

expressed such earnest thought and softened feeling, that
MIss. Milton determined on not interrupting it by
calling at MIoorlnds as she had intended, and so
turned in the direction of Reilly MInor. They walked
on for some little time in silence, gradually ascending
one of those steep and narrow but green and flowers
lanes peculiar to Dconshire; andon reaching the
summit of the hill, and passing a moment by the little
gate that opened on a rich meadow, through which their
path lay, an exclamation of  How beautiful'' burst
from Ear.
Fields of alternate red and green asloped down to the
river's edge, the green bearing the glistening colour
peculiar to MAy, the red from the full rich soil betraying
that the plough hal but lately been there, and both

deep azure seemed to mock the very heavens. he

all presented the exquisite variety of green peculiar to
May, and so lofty was the slope on which they grew,
that some seemed to touch the very sky, while others
bent gracefully over the water, which their think
branches nearly stood. The hills themselves pre-
seated a complete mosaiec of red and green; the fields
divided by high hedges, from which the oak and cl and
eecl and ash would start up, of growth so superb as
to have the semblance of a cultivated park, nut of
natural woodland.

though lovely still, MIr. Grerille's excesses had already
shorn of some of their finest timber. Some parts of
the river were in complete shade from the overhanging
branches, while beyond them would stretch the bright
blue of heaven: in other parts, a stray sunbcam would
dart through as opening in the thick branches, and
shine like s bright spot in the surrounding darkness;
and farther on, the cloudless sun so flung down his
full refulgence, that the moving waters flashed and
sparkled like burning gems
Is it not beautiful, dear Aunt? Sometimes I feel as
if I were not half so passionate in the open air as in
the house: can you tell me why ?''
Not exactly, Edward,'' she replied, smiling; but1
I am very pleased to hear you say so, and to find that
you can admire such a lovely scene as this, To my
feelings, the presence of a loving God is so impressed
upon his works; e can so distinctly trace goodness,
and love, and power, in the gift of such a beautiful world,
that I feel still more how wrong it is to indulge in
vexation, or care, or anxiety, when in the midst of
beautiful country, than when at home; and perhaps it is
something of the same feeling working in yo, though
you do not know how to decline it.''
 bUt you can never lo or feel anything wrong, dear
Aunt,'' said Edward, looking with surprised inquiry in
her face.
Indeed, my dear boy, I know that I very often hae
wrong thoughts and feelings; and that only my Father
in heaven's infinite mercy tables me to overcome them.
It would be very sad, if I were as fault, and as easily

led into error, as you and your cousins may be, when
I have had so many more years to think and try to
improve in; but just in the same way as you have
duties to perform and feelings to overcome, so have I;
and if I fail in the endeavour to lead you all in the
better and happier path-or feel too much anxiety, or
shrink from going myself pain, when compelled to
correct a fault in either of you, I am just as likely to
incur the displeasure of our Father in Heaven as you
are when you are passionate or angry; and perhaps
still more so, for the more capable we are of knowing
and doing our duty, the more wrong we are when we
fail in it, en in thought.''
There was so much in this reply to surprise Edward,
it seemed so to fill his mind with new ideas, that he con-
tinued his walk in absolute silence. That his aunt could
ever fail as she seemed to say she had and did, and even
still at times found it difficult to do right, silvery strange;
but yet somehow it seemed to comfort him, and to inspire
him with a sort of courage to emulate her, and conquer
his difficulties. le had fancied, that she could not
possibly understand how difficult it was for him always
to be good; but when he found that she could do so
even from her own experience, her words appeared en-
lowed with double force, and e loved her, and looked
up to her more than her.
In minutes more brought them to the gothic ledge
of the MInor, and instead of seeking the front entrance,

wonder she is not watching for me as usual,'' observed
MRs. Milton, somewhat anxiously, at her anxiety
increased, as on nearing the half open door she saw poor
Mary, er head leaning against Clearer, delugel in tears.
MRs. Greville was not there, though the books, work,
and maps upon the table told of their morning's
employment having been the same as usual. Herbert
was earnestly endeavouring to speak comfort, but evil-
gently without success; and MAry was in general so
controlled, that her present grief betrayed some very
much leader trial than usual.
 Is your mother ill, my dear MAry? What an hae
happened to agitated you so painfully?'' she inquired
as at the first sound of her voice the poor girl sprung
towards her, and tried to say low very glad she
was that she had come just then; but the words were
inarticulate from sobs; and MRs. IIamilton, desiriug
Edward to amuse himself in the garden, made her sit
down by her, and told her not to attempt to check her
tears, but to let them have free vent a few minutes, and
then to turn tell her what had occurred. It was a
sad tale for a child to tell, and as MRs. IIamilton's
previous knowledge enabled her to gather more from it
than Mary's broken narrative permitted, we will gie it
in or own ords,
MIr. Grevrille hal been at home for a month, a quarter
of which time the good humour which some unusually
successful hers had excited, lasted; but no longer. His
amusement ten consisted, as usual, in trying every
method to annoy anlirritate his wife, and in endeavour-
ing to make his son exactly like himself. Young as the

happily near neighbours, permitted; and though
Alfred's cheek become pale, his eye haggard, and his
temper under, his initiation was frantic with such
new species of excitement and pleasure, that it rejoiced
and encouraged his father in the same measure as it
agonized his mother, and, for her sake, poor MAry.
That morning Alfed had declared his intention of
visiting a large fair, which, with some races of but ill
repute, from the bad company they collected, was to be
held at a neighbouring town, and told his father to pre-
care for a large demand on his cash, as he meant to try
his hand at all the varieties of aiming which the scene
presented. Mr. Greville laughed heartily at what he
called the boy's right spirit, and promised him all he
requires; but there was a quivering on her mother's lip,
a deadly paleness on her cheek, that spoke volumes of
suffering to the heart of the observnt MAry, who
sat trembling beside her. Still Mrs. Groeville did not
speak till her husband left the room; but then, as Aifred
was about to follow him, she caught hold of his hand,
and implored him, with such a tone and look of agony,
only to listen to her, for her sake to give up lis intended
pleasure; that, almost frightened by an emotion which in
his gentle mother he had scarcely ever seen, and suddenly
remembering that he had lately been indeed not unkind
andneglectful to her, he threw his arms round her neck,
and promised with tears, that if it gave her so much pain,
he would not go; and so sincere was his feeling at the
moment that, had there been no tempter near, he would,
in all probability, have kept his word. , but the moment

sneered at his want of spirit in preferring his mother's
whims to lis father's pleasures, that, as could not fail to
be the case, every better feeling fled. This ought to have
been enough; but it was too good an opportunity to eat
his ill-temper on his wife, to be neglected. IHIe sought
her, where she was superintending MAry's lessons, and
for nearly an hour poured upon her the most fearful
abuse and cutting taunts, ending by declaring, that all
the good she had done by her saintly eloquence, was to
banish her son from her presence, whenever he left home,
as in future Alfed should he his companion; and that
he should begin that very day. Mrs. Greville neither
moved nor spoke in reply; and the expression of her
countenance was so sternly calm, that poor hlary felt as

heart was bursting.

to obey. Fortunately her task was writing, for to have
spoken or read aloud would, she felt, hae been im-

footsteps were heard in the hall, and the joyous voice
of Alfred exclaiming-
`Let me wish Mamma and Mary god-by, Papa.''

rapidly faded away in the distance. With an irresistible
impulse, MAry raised her eyes to her mother's face; a
bright red flush had risen to her temples, but her lips were
perfectly colourless, and her hand tightly pressed her
heart, but this only lasted a minute, for the next she had
fallen quite senseless on the floor. PIer poor child hung
over her almost paralysed with terror, and sooner did the
faint last, that she was conveyed to her own room, partially
undressced, and laid on her bed, before she at all recovered.
A brief while she had clasped MAry to her bosom, as if
in her was indeed her only earthly comfort, and then in
a faint voice desired to be left quite alone. DIary had
flung herself on the neck of the sympathising IHIerbert
Ilcmilton (who had arrived just in the confusion, attend-
ant on MIss. Greville's unusual illness), and wept there
in all the uneontrollel violence of early sorrow.
Mrs. lIamilton remained some time with her afflicted

her society brought with it the only solace MRs. Greville
was capable of realizing from human companionship.

employment, to restore some degree of peace and happy-
ness to her chill.
Neither Herbert nor Edward seemed inclined to con-
ease on their walk home, and MRs. Milton was so
engrossed in thought for Mrs. Reilly, that she did not
feel disposed to speak either. Herbert was contasting
his father with Mary's, and with such a vivid sense of
his own happier lot, that he felt almost oppressed with
the thought, he was not, he never could be, grateful
enough; for what had he done, to her so much more
blessed -And when I. Milton, who, wondering at
their long absence, had come out to meet them, put his
arm affectionately round him, and asked him what could
possibly make him look so pale and pensive, the boy's
excited feelings completely overpowered him. He buried
his face on his father's shoulder, and burst into tears;

quite sure she could, without his telling her, darted

sanctuary of his own room; and there he remained,
trying to calm himself by earnest thought and almost
unconscious prayer, till the inner-bell summoned him,
to rejoin lis family, which he did quiet and gentle, but
cheerful, as usual.
eDward did not forget the thoughts of the morning,
but the struggle so to subdue his pride as to apologise
to Robert, seemed very much more difficult when he was
no longer hearing his aunt's earnest words ; but he did
conquer himself, and the fond approving look, with
which he was rewarded, gave him such a glowing feeling
of pleasure, as almost to lessen the pain of his humiliation.

Not exactly: he has merely said he thinks it a day

now, I am not inclined to do, for I am sure to suffer
from it afterwards.''
 Well, all I can say is, that when I am as old as
you are, Perecy, I shall certainly consider myself under
no one. I hope I shall be at Eton by that time, and
then we shall see if Cecil Rather has not some spirit
in him. I would not be tied down to Oakwood, and to
M. TOwards's humdrum lessons, as you are, Percy, for
worlds.''
Take care that Cecil Grandam's spirit does not
effervesce so much, as to make him, when at Eton,
wish himself ask at Moorlanls,'' replied Perry, laugh-
ing heartily at his young companion's grotesque attempt
at self-consequence, by placing his cap blindly on his
ear, lourishing his one, and trying to make himself
look taller. Cecil took his laugh, however, in good
part, and they continued in amicable conversation till

very often led him into error and its disagreeable con-
sequeuces; and, fearing this lad again been the case,
she playfully inquired the cause of his most unusual
abstraetion. He coloured, but ended the question,
and successfully roused himself to tall. IIi mother
was not anxious, for she had such perfect confidence in
him, that she knew if he had committed error, he would
redeem it, and that his own good feelings and high
principles would prevent its recurrence.
It so happened, however, that young Ambition, by a
series of rather imprudent actions, had plunged himself
into such a very usual and disagreeable position, as
not very well to know how to extricate himself from it
without a full confession to his father; which, dnringly
brave as in general he was, he felt almost as if he
really had not the courage to make. One of MIr.
Milton's most imperative commands was, that his
sons should never incur a debt, and, to prevent the
temptation, their monthly allowance was an ample one,
and fully permitted any reereative indulgence they
might desire.
Now Percy was rather inclined to extravagance, from
thoughtlessness and a profuse generosity, which had
often caused him such annoyance as to make him
resolve again and again to follow his father's advice,
and keep some accounts of his expenditure, as a slight
check on himself. The admiration for beauty in the
fine arts, which his mother had so sedulously cultivated,
had had only one bad effect; and that was that his
passion for prints and paintings, and illustrated and
richly-round volumes, sometimes carried him beyond

eugravsrings and bindings. Lie had given orders to MIr.

Milton felt to do without them till his father or he
himself should visit the metropolis, and so judge of
their warmth themselves, was quite impossible. The
order was given without the leastregard to price. They
arrived at the end of the month, and the young gentle-
man, to his extreme astonislcnt, discovered that his
month's allowance had been so expeuded, not to leave
him a half quarter of the necessary sum. What to do
he did not very well no. Mr. CArries had had great
difficulty in procuring the prints, and of course he was
bound in honour to take them. If he waited till he
could pay for them, he must sacrifice the whole of one

it, declaring that, if MIr, Percy did not pay him for a

him for any sum or any time he liked. But to make no

Arrive, he agreed to pay his debt by instruments, and
so in two or three months, at the very latest, discharge
the whole.
One week afterwards he received is month's allow-
ance, and riding over directly to the town relieved his
conscience of half its long. To have only half his usual
sum, however, for ronthly expenditure caused him so
many clocks and annoyance as to make him hate the
very sight of the prints whose possession he and s
coveted, but he looked forward to the next month to
be free at least of MIr. Carries. The idea of disobedience
to his father in inquiring a debt at all causing him ore
annoyance than all the rest.
Again the first day of the month came round, and
putting the full sum required in his purse, he set off,
but on his way encountered such a scene of distress,
that very thought fled from his mind, except how ta
relief it. He accompanied the miserable half-famished
man to a hut in which lay a seemingly dying woman
with a new-born have, and two or three small half-
stared, half-naked children,-listened to their story,
which was really one of truth and misfortune, not of

gentleman at the outskirts of the town, told his story,

impelled by a weight of lend. The conviction flashed
upon him that he had been giving away money which
was actually not his own; and the seed which had been
productive of so much internal happiness, now seemed
to reproach and condemn him. He rode back without
even seeking Mr. Artist, for what could he tell him as
the reason of his non-payment.' certainly not his having
given it away.
The first of MAy, which was his birthday, he had
been long engaged to spend with some young men and
lads who were to have a grand game of crickcet, a jovial
dinner, in adjournment to some evening amusement,
and, to conclude the day, a gay supper, with flees and
songs. Mr. IIamilton had rather wished Percy to leave
the party after dinner and had told him so, merely
however, a a preference, not a command, but giving
him permission to use his own discretion. Percy knew
there would he several expenses attendant on the day,
but still he had promised so long to be one of the party,
which all had declared would be nothing without him,
and his own inclinations so urged him to join it, that it

excess, s not quite so guarded as usual. A clergyman
had lately appeared at T-, whose appearance, manners,
and opinions had given more than usual food for gossip,
and much uncharitableness. IIi cloth since ought
to hnse protected him, but it rather increased the
satire, sarcasm, and laughter which he excited. I was
brought forward by the thoughtless youths of Percy's
party, puzzled unmercifully, made the object of some
clever caricatures and satires, and though young lIIamilton
at first kept aloof, he could not resist the contagion.
He dashed off about half-a-dozen verses of such re-
markably witty and clear point, that they were received
with roars of applause, and an unanimous request for
distribution ; but this he positively refused, and put
them up with one or two other palms of more innocent
wit, in which he was fond of indulging, into his pocket.
The lay closed, and the next morning brought with
it so many regrets, and such a eonfuscl recollection of
the very unusual excitement of the previous even-
in, that he was glad to dismiss the subject from
his mind, and threw his satire, as he believed, into the
fire. In fact, he was so absorbed with the disagree-
able conviction hat he could only pay MIr. CArries a third
of his remaining debt, trifling as in reality it was, that
he thought of nothing else. Now MIr. Christ was the
editor and published of rather a clever weekly paper,
and Perry happened to be in his parlour waiting to
speak to him, while he was paying n contributor.

For the next few days Percy trod on air. He had
resolved on waiting till the poem appeared, and then, as
he really had disclarged his debt, take courage and con-

him shrink from any farther concealment. DIe hoped

constant annoyance he had been enduring so long, a4s
sufficient penalty for his disobedience, and after a time
give him back the confidence, which he friend must at

What, then, was his grief, his vexation, almost his
despair, when he recognized in the poem selected, the
verses he thought and believed he had burneltle morn-
ing after they were written; and which i print, and
read by his sober self, seemed such a leartless, glaring,

ordering an expensive and unnecessary indulgence,
without sufficient consideration ho it was to be paid.
To tell his father, now himself the author of such a
satire, and on such a subject, he could not. Could he
tell his mother, and implore her intereession? that

he ever could gain courage to confess it, it should be to
IF. IIamilton alone; but the more he thought, the more
for the first time his courage failed. It was only the day
before his visit to Lady Helen's that he had discovered
this accumulation of misfortune, and therefore it was not
much wonder he was so dispiritel.-Two days after-
wards lIberty, with a blushing cheek and very timid
voice, asked his gentler to grant him a great favour. He
was almost afraid to ask it, he said, but he hoped and
believed his parent would trust his assurance that it
was for nothing improper. It was that he might be
from home the next day unattended for several hours.
DIe should go on horseback, but he was so accustomed
to rid, and his horse was so steady, he hoped he might
be allowed to go alone. MIr. Milton looked very
much surprised, as in all present. That the quiet,
stulious llerbcrt should wish to give up his favourite
pursuits, so soon too after MIr. TOwards's return, and go
on what appeared such a mysterious excursion, was
something so extraordinary, that various expressions of
surprise broke from his sisters and Edward. Percy

errors, than have even another IIerbert. So, pry lo
not look so sat, or I shall fancy I have given you pain,

Percey threw his arm round her waist, and kissed her
two or three times, without saying a word, and when he
started up and said, in his usual gay tone, that, as he was
not going to turn truant the next day, he must go and
finish some work, she saw tears in cheeks. That some-
thing was wrong, she felt certain, but still she trusted in
his candour and integrity, and did not express her fears
even to her husband.
The morrow came. Perry and Edward went to MIr.
Howard's, and Herbert at half-past nine mounted his quiet
horse, and after affectioually embracing his mother, and
again promising care and steadiness, parted. He had
risen at five this morning, and studied till breakfast so
earnestly, that a double portion was prepared for the
next day. He had said, as he was starting, that, if he
might remain out so long, he should like to call at
Groeville MInor on his way back, take tea there, and
return home in the cool of the evening.

enjoyed the most unalloyel happiness. IIi pretty
vicarage presented a happy comfortable home for his
parents, and the comforts they now enjoyed, earned by
the worth of their son, imply repaid them for former
priations. One cold snowy night he was summoned
to a poor parishioner, living about ten miles distant;
the road was rugged, and in some parts dangerous ; but
he was not a man to shrink from his duty for such
reasons. Ice was detained eight hours, during which
time the snow had fallen incessantly, and it was pitchy
dark. Sill believing he knew his road, he proceeded,

the sight of his fellows. His voice, once so rich and
almost thrilling, became wiry, and almost painfully
monotonous; and for some months the conflict for
submission to this inscrutable and most awful trial was
so terrible, that he nearly sunk beneath it. This was
of course still more physical than mental, and gradually
subsided, as, after eighteen months' residence in Italian,
where he as sent by a heneolent friend, some portion
of health returned. The same benefactor established
his father i some while but most welcome business

kept aloof from all but his own poor parishioners,

as to ridicule him because he is deformed?''
 Unfortunately, my dear child, there are too many
who only enter church for the sake of the sermon and
the preacher, and to eriticise severely and uncharitable
all that differs from their preconceived ideas; to such
persons MIr. EMotion must be an object of derision.
And now I come to the real reason of my asking your
mother if she remembered him,
 Then you had a reason,'' answered Mrs. Milton,
smiling; `` your story has made me wonder whether
you had or not,''
I must tax your memory once more, Emmeline,
before my cause is told. Do you recollect, for a fort-
night after the Sunday we led him, he preached twice
a week nt Torrington, to oblige n very particular friend ''
Yes, and that you found the increased number of

than kinlliness or devotion,.''

interesting conversation. He was evidently been more
than usually depressed and self-shrinking, if I may use
the word, and at length touched, it seemed by my

I wonder CArries should lay published them,''
observed is Harcourt ; `his paper is not in general
of a personal kind,''
It is never sufficiently guarded, and it would
require a person of higher principles than I fear CArries
has, to resist the temptation of answering a satire likely
to sell  double or treble number of his papers. I
spoke to him at once, and bought up every one that
remained ; but though he expressed regret, it was not
in a tone that at all satisfied me as to his feeling it,
and of course, as the paper has been published since
last thursday evening, the circulation had nearly ceased.

choked with his emotion, that he could only throw
himself by her side, bury his face in her lap, and so
for a few minutes like a child. But he recovered
himself with a strong effort, before either of his family
could conquer their anxiety and alarm, and, standing
erect, though pale as marble, without in the least degree
attempting excuse or extenuation, aeknowledged the
poem as his, and poured out his whole story, with the
sole exception of how he had disposed of the money,
with which the second time of receiving his allowance he
had intended to discharge his debt; and the manner
in which he told that part of his tale, from the far
tlt it would seem like an excuse or a boast, was
certainly more calculated to call for dost than belief.
Herbert was about to speak, but an imploring glance
from Percy checked him.
Mr. Milton was silent several minutes after his
son had concluded, before he could reply. Perry was
so evidently distressed-had suffered so much from the
consequence of his own errors-felt so intensely the
unintentional publication of his poem-for his father
knew his truth far too well to doubt his tale, and there
was something so intrinsically noble in his brave con-

 O wilful cruelty towards Mr. EMotion, your story

could; ' but otherwise you must he yourself aware that
it has given me both grief and pain, and the more so,

manner you squandered away that money which would

some deed of folly revealed. I condemn you to no
punishment-you are old enough now to know right
from wrong, and our own feelings must condemn or

were, example only not so have worked upon you,

some minutes without speaking-only looking up in

WhiLE the young heir of Soaked had passed

deign to address Herhert and Heard, who, perceiving
him leave the Vicarage with every mark of irritation,
endeavoured, during their walk home, to soothe him.
His step was even more rapid than that in which
he had left home, and he neither stopped nor spoke
till he had reached his father's library, which, forty-
lately for the indulgence of his ire in words, was un-
tenantel. He dashed his cap from his brow, flung
his books with violence on the ground, and burst forth-

pushed back the clustering hair from his heated fore-
head, and the gentle touch of her cool hand seemed
s restoratie as er soothing words; and Percy as he
listened to her, as she continued speaking to him in
the same strain for some little time, felt more received
than five minutes before he thought possible, and more
than ever determined that he would never act so
thoughtlessly; or, if he were tempted to do so, never
keep it concealed so long again. MRs. 1Milton's
anxious desire with him, was always to do justice to
his better qualities, at the same time that she blamed
and convinced him of his faults. It was a very delicate
thing, and very difficult to succeed in, perhaps impos-
sible, to minds less peculiarly refined and hearts less
intensely anxious than Mrs. Milton's; hut no life-
could, no failure, had ever deterred her-and in Percy
she was already rewarded. He was of that high fine spirit,
that any unjust harshness would have actually confirmed
in error-any tnguarded word bring argument on

him to abide in his opinions, when the acknowledgment

Mother, but the whirl of that night seemed to
extend to the morning, and I dressed and prepared
for Mr. Coward in such a hurry (I had oerslept
myself too), that though Had quite resolved they should
not pollute my pocket-book any longer, I had no time
to look over my papers-thought I could not be
mistaken in their outside-burnt those I really wished
to keep, and threw those which had caused me all
this pain into my portfolio. If I had but been firm
enough to have followed my father's advice, and left

with a more than sufficient quantity of wine, that I id
not know what i was about-not its extent of wrong,

And you have suffered enough for an evening's
excitement, my poor boy; but i am sure you would
atone for it, if you could.''

He looked at her in utter bewilderment.

Do not ask me such a thing, Mother,'' he answered,

you either the humiliation or the pain, yet produce the

from MIr. EMotion's sensitive feelings but yourself, and
I am quite sure, if you will allow yourself a little
time for quiet thought, you will agree with me.''
But why should 1 inflict such pain upon myself,
granting I deserve it?' answered Perry, still much
heated; hen, though my poem is the only one that
has unfortunately met his eye, the others were quite as
galling, and my companions quite as much to blame
-why should I be the sufferer ?''
 Because by many errors you love brought it on
yourself. Your companions did indeed act very wrongly,
but are we quite sure that the principles which your
father and MIr. Howard have so carefully impressed
upon you, have been as carefully impressed upon them
and in such a case are not you the more responsible?
They hal evidently no inward check to keep them from
such an amusement; you had, for you have acknowledged

pain of an avowalupon yourself, my boy, and its memory
will help you in future from yielding to too great weak-
ness-and the act prove to us that, though for a moment
led into great error, you are still as brave and honest
as we heliere you,''
Percy did not reply, but his countenance denoted
an inward struggle, and his mother added-
 Suppose, as is very likely, MIr. Mlortcn becomes
intimate here; how can you, with your open truthful
heart, associate with him, with any comfort or con-
silence, even though perfectly satisfied that we would
not betray you, and that he would never know the
truth? You may fancy now that you could, but I
know my Percy better; but I must not talk to you any
more, for the dressing-hell rang some minutes ago.
Remember, my dear boy, that 1 lay no command on
you to seek Mr. EMotion; I have only told you that
which I believe would restore you to happiness and
atone for your faults, more effectually than anything
else; but you are quite at liberty to act as you think
proper.''
She left the room as she spoke, but Perry remained
for some few minutes longer in deep thought, and when
he prepared for dinner and joined his family, it was
still in the same unbroken silence. Mr. IIamiltou took
no notice of him, and two or three time the little

DIe kissed her forehead and left her, and a few
minutes afterwards she was summoned to join her
mother, Caroline, and Ellen in a walk. They saunteed
through the grounds in the direction of the northern
lodge, which opened on the road leading to Dartmoor;
when, not a quarter of an hour after they had left the
house, they were overtaken by Percy, riding at what
seemed almost a hand gullop, but he had time as he
passed his mother to graevefully off his cap, and her
fond heart throbbed, as she caught the expression of
his flushed but earnest face. He was out of sight in

particular that every member of his household should

had his fine spirit been soothed or irritated? and a
thousand other nameless but natural fears thronged her

dark cyc sparkled, and he looked more bright and
joyous than he had done for weeks. He advanced

Astonished an touched, far more than he was her in

son's eager heart, for he answered earnestly-

' Indeed?'' answered Ashamed, smiling; ``is your

I fear it is,'' she answered in the same tone;
 Ellen is my youngest child-and that which has
been my successful help five times, has become blunted
at the sixth, and refuses to aid me farther.''
 Shame, donot heed her,'' interposed her husband,
laughing; ``she fancies there is something extraordinary
about Ellen, which she cannot comprehend; and I feel
certain that imagination has been playing with my
wife's sober judgment, and that our little niece is a
very ordinary child, only rather more sad and quiet than
is usual to her age; which may be easily accounted
for by her early trials and constant ill-health. So I1

so few fancies, however, that I do not quarrel with this,

There were more than usual subjects of thought on
the minds of all the young inmates of Oakwood, before
they went to sleep that night. Perry's, IIcrbert's, and
Emmeline's were all peculiarly happy and peaceful.
Caroline's were not so agreeable. Praise lavishcd on

The poor eLlen was often thought, as she expressed
it, ``naughty'' was true; and it was this mingling of
many apparent faults, especially disregard to her aunt's
commands, and but too often endeavour to conceal an
equivocate, instead of an open confession, with a sorrow
and repentance too deep and painful for her years,
that so fairly bewildered Mrs. Milton, and really, as
she had told MIr. Ashamed, prevented her from under-
standing Ellen. If she could but have known of that
unfortunate promise, and the strong hold it had taken
of the child's vivid imagination;-that by dwelling on
it, she had actually made herself believe, that by always
shielling Edward from blame or punishment, she was
obeying and making her mother lore her from Heaven,
and so, still more deeening her father's affection for
her; and that this idea enabled her to bear the suffering

untried to remove such a mistaken impression, and i
doubt would hae succeeded; but she had not the
slightest conception of the real origin of her niece's
incomprehensible contradictions. She had believed and

could not he only maternal neglect, but actual spoke-

of truth, Ellen frequently, instead of attempting to
conceal what Reward might have hopelessly done,
actually took it upon herself, not being able to define
that in such self-sacrifice she was also forgetting truth;,
or if she did believe so, it was also clear, that to tell the,
real truth to her aunt and betray Edward, was breaking
her solemn promise to her mother, and either way she
was doing wrong. To describe or defie the chaos
in the poor child's mind, from these contcnding feel-
wings, would he almost as impossible to us as it was to

when she most wished to be good; that her aunt must
think she did not care for her displeasure; when it

feel happy, for even when ``good'' there always seemed

I was the Christmas action-always a happy
season in the hall of Oakwood. The previous year,
the general juenile party with which MIr. and Mrs.
IHamilton indulged their children on the first or sixth of
January, as circumstances permitted, had not taken
place, on account of MRs. Fortescue's death, and was
therefore this year anticipated with even more than
usual joy. Caroline and kEmmeline were never permitted
to go to indiscriminate parties. To or three, really
confined to children, their mother allowed their joining
with Miss IIarconrt, in the course of the year, but
their own ball was always considered the came of
enjoyment, especially now that Caroline began to fancy
herself very much to old for only children's parties.
annie went almost everywhere with Lady SIlent, and
quite laughed at the idea of joining children, and
Caroline this year began to wish most intensely that
her mother would take her out to grown-p parties
too, and lost all relish for the pleasant parties she had
enjoyed. MRs. IIamilton never obliged her to go out
with Emmeline and Ellen, if she really did not wish it;
but Caroline could not get any farther in considering
herself a woman.

The week before Christmas, Mr. and MRs. Ilamilton
did not allow to be all likely and amusement. The
season was to the feelings of religion one of earnest
intense thankfulness, and they wished to make it
equally so to their children-a source of joy and hope,
indeed, but the joy and hope of Helen, not the mere
amusements and pleasures of earth. Ther ad thought
Long and tried earnestly to make their children so to
lore serious things, as never to associate them with
gloom or sadness-never to fancy that to be truly and
spiritually religious demanded a relinquishment of
the joys and pleasures and innocent happiness of their

week was always anticipated with quiet gladness, for
they were still more with their father and mother; and
the few serious readlings and lessons they had, were
from and with them alone; MIss IIarcounrt's time was
then entirely her own. As soon as Christmas-day was
passed, the young party, with the sole exception of two
ours' work by themselves, in the morning or some
part of the day, if the mornings were wanted-(for.

it was winter, was filled with some beautiful flowering
geranius of all colours, and some few rare myrtles in

let me ask Uncle if we my move it, dear Edward; do

 And so betray my being in a passion the other day,
and get me a repraof for that, and for my carelessness
into the bargain. Nonsense, Ellen; I will get it, and
you must help me, for I have not a moment to lose.''
No, Edward inced, indeed I cannot touch it ;
she replied, imploringly, and shrinking back.

beyond all forbearance; ``and the other day you were
so very sorry i was going from me so soon-much
you must care about me, that you cannot do such a
trifling thing as this to oblige me I hate deceit,''
Ellen made no reply, though the tears started to her
eyes; but as usual her firmness deserted her. The
heavy stand was carefully moved a little forwards, with-
out injuring any of the plants; the book was obtained,
and at that moment the voice of Percy was heard ex-
claiming-

only be confessing her own disobedienee, but inculpating
her brother, and really perhaps deprive him of the en-
moments he anticipated, and so confirm his unkind
words. She tried to replace it, and thought she had
quite succeeded; but as she moved it, one of the myrtles
fell to the ground, and its beautiful blossom hung on
the stalk, presered from being quite broken off only by
three or four delicate fibres. It was Caroline's favourite
plant; one she so cherished and tended, that Percy called
it her petted child; and poor Ellen stood paralysed; she
raised the pot mechanically, and rested the broken head
of the lower against the still uninjure spring, and it
looked so well and natural, that the thought for a
moment darted across her mind that after all it might
not be discovered. Then came all her and's lessons of
the many ways of acting an untruth without words, and,
therefore, even if it should not be discovered, was no
comfort;-but could she, dared she voluntarily confess
what must appear a wilful lisobedieuce? If her aunt
had been at home, she might in that first moment have
gained the necessary courage; but she was not expected
back for two or three hours, and Ellen sat with her face
buried in her hands, only conscious of misery, till her
cousin's joyous voice called out from the hall-

Percy was soactire, so obliging, so amusing in his queer
ways of working and talking, that she almost forgot
the impending trial, till she met her aunt and cousins at
luncheon. Edward had been so intent, so happy at his
business with his uncle; that he never cast a thought as
to how the stand got back, and after lunch he had to a
for s row on the river, and after dinner to attend a
lecture on astronomy, which that night and the one
following was to be given at the town-hall in T-. IIi
uncle and Percy and Herbert were to accompany him,
and so that he should give a thought to anything dis-
agreeable was not likely.
The day wore on ; Ellen's little courage had all gone
and she almost unconsciously hoped that nothing would
be discovered. IN. IIamilton and the lads departed at
six, and Mrs. Milton proposed adjoining to her death-
tears' room, to finish an entertaining book that they were
reading aloud. She had noticed, with her usual pen-
tration, that all day Ellen evidently shrunk from her
eye, and felt quite sure something was wrong again ; but
she asked no questions, fearing again to tempt equi-
ocation. Caroline's passionate exclamation that some
body had broken her beautiful flower, drew the attention
of all to the stand, and one glance sufficed to tell MIss.
IIamilton that it had been moved. Her anxious s-
picions nt one connected this with Ellen's shrinking
manner, and she turned to ask her if she knew any-
thing about it. But Ellen had disappeared; and she rang

that one unjust charge seemed to gie back the power of
speech, though the violent reproach and negative which
burst from Cnroline prevented anything farther.
I must beg you to be silent, Caroline, or to leave
the room, till I have done speaking to your cousin,'' said
her mother, quietly; ``the fate of your flower seems to
make you forget that I have never yet permitted dis-
respect or any display of temper in my presence.''
But what right had Ellen to touch the stand ?'
 None-she has both disobeyed and again tried to
deceive me; faults which it is my duty to chastise, but
not yours to upbraid. Answer me, Ellen, at once and
briefly; your fault is known, ad, therefore, all farther
equivoeation is useless. Did you more that flower-

Yes,'' replied the child, almost choked with sobs,
called forth the more from the contrast which her aunt's
mildness presented to Miss HIarcourt's harshness and
Caroline's violent anger; and from the painful longing
to say that her first disobedience was not entirely her
own fault.
Did you remember that I had expressly forbidden
either of you to attempt to move it?''

the apparent hardihood of her conduct escaped from
both Miss Harcourt and Caroline.

either of these assertions. Why did you leave the room

I should have been better satisfied, Ellen, if your
fear of my displeasure had prevented the committal of
our first fault, not to aggravate it so painfully by both
acted and spoken untruths. Painful as it is to me in this
season of festivit and enjoyment to inflict suffering, I
should share your sin if I did not adopt some measures
to endeavour at least to make you remember and so
avoid it in future. I have told you so very often that

Ellen quitted the room without answering; but it was
several minutes before Mrs. IIamilton could sufficiently

into her daughters' amusements; but she would not

found the effects of what was actually in the first instance
his fault; but he had not sufficient boldness to say so
1is aunt had expressly said it was the untruth that had
ocenasioned her greatest displeasure, that if the dis-
obedience had been confessed at once, she would, in

such a deliberate story ?''
That he was acting one of equal deliherntion, and of
far more culpability if possible-for he was permitting
her to bear the whole weight of his fault-never struck
it ; if it did, he did not at all understand or heliee
it. He went to his sister, and offered to confess his
share in her fault, and when-as he fully expected-she
begged him not, that it could do her no good, and
perhaps only get him punished too, his conscience was

reply;  I know the untruth is entirely my own fault,
so why should it torment you; if I could but always tell

oh, how I wonder if ever shall'' and she leaned her head
on her arms which rested on the table, so despondingly,
so sorrowfully, that Edward felt too uncomfortable to
remain with her. He was satisfied that he could not
help her; but the disagreeable thought would come, that
if he had not tempted her to disobey, she would have
had no temptation to tell an untruth, and so he sought
a variety of active amusements to get rid of the feeling.

The tone and words were so earnest, sa sad, that not

her conduct upon their mother. She was always grieved

again and again accent herself of too great harshness,;
for, perhaps, after all, it might have no better effect
than kindness; but what could she do? She almost
envied the quiet, unrufied concern of less anxious

when she was.
The next night, to Ellen's disposition, as a greater
trial than the riday. She neither expected, nor hardly
wished to be allowed, to go to MIr. TOwards's, though,
as the affectionate Emmelinc ha come to wish her
good night, and with tears in her eyes repeated her
regrets that she was not to go, she felt the bitter
disappointment more than in the morning she had
thought possible; but Saturday night it had been her
aunt's custom, from the time she had been at Lowood,
to visit her daughters and niece before they went to
sleep, and prepare them for their Sabbath's rest and
enjoyment, by an examination of their conduct during
the past week, and full forgiveness of anything that
had been wrong. When younger, MRs. IIamilton had
attended to his duty every night; but wishing to give
them a habit of private prayer and self-examination,
independent of her, she had, after Emmeline was twelve
years old, set apart the Saturday night, until they ere
fifteen-old enough for her to relinquish it altogether.
It had been such a habit with her own children, that
they felt it perfectly natural; but with Ellen and
Edward, from their never having been accustomed to it
as young children, she had never felt the duty understood
by them, or as satisfactorily performed by herself as
with her own. Still, Ellen looked forward to this night
as the termination of her banishment; for great indeed

Sabbath. Ellen could not remember one instance since
she had been at Lowood, and when she heard the
doors of her cousins' rooms suecessively close, and her
aunt's step retreating without approaching hers, she
did, indeed, believe herself irreclaimably wicked, or
her kind good aunt would, at least, have come to her.
MRs. IIamilton had purposely refrained from indulging
her own inclinations, as well as comforting Ellen,
hoping still more to impress upon her how greatly she
had sinned. The impossibility of her perfectly come-
pretending her niece's character, while the poor child
felt it such a sacred duty to victims herself, made
her far more severe than she would have been, only

their deaths, and with alternate wakefulness, draught
with those deadly incomprehensible terrors which some
poor children of strong imagination know so well, eLlen's
night passed; and the next morning she rose, with
that painful throbbing in her throat and temples, which
always ended with one of those intense and exhausting
headache to which she had been so subject, but which
her aunt's care and MIr. MIaitland's remedies had much
decreased, both in frequency and violence. She went
to church, however, with the family, as usual.
` Remain out, Edward.'' Perry exclaimed, as they
neared the house; ``the old year is taking leave of us
in such a glorious mood, that in and I are going
to realise and poets till dinner-ill you come with
us?-and you, Ellen?'
Ellen withdrew her arm from her brother's, saying,
as she did so-
 Go, ear Edward, I am very tired, and would
rather not,''
 Tired? and with this short walk; and you really
do look as if you were-what is the matter, eLlen2

so, so often since the Tuesday morning, that his

their household who were unable to attend divine
service in the morning to go in the afternoon. With

Their great wish was to make the Sabbath a day of
love, divine and domestic; to make their children look
to it with joy and anticipation throughout the week
as a day quite distinct in its enjoyment from any other:
and for this reason, while their children were young,
they only went to church in the morning, the after-
noans were devoted to teaching them to know and t
love God in IIi works as well as word, and their
evening to such quiet but happy amusements and
literature, as would fill their young hearts with increased
thankfulness for their very happy lot. As they are
older, they were perfectly at liberty to do as they pleased
with regard to the afternoon church. IlIerbert, whose

years, generally spent the greater part of Sunday with

The contemplation of serious things as his greatest
happiness, but Mr. and MRs. Milton did not expect
that all their other children were to be like him. They
were contented, and intensely thankful also, to perceive
that diverse as were their characters, still the constant
sense of God's presence and of lIes infinite love was
active and earnest in them all, inviting love and never-
once for Herbert, even though they could not sympathise
with him entirely. Another peculiarity of Mr. Milton
consisted in his permitting no Sunday schools at
Alight and his other villages. The Saturday after-
uoons ere set apart instead of the Sunday. He
wished his wife, and daughters when they were old
enough, to superintend them, and help the children in
preparing for the Sunday services and sUnday enjoy-

overwork on a day of rest, which could not fail to be
the case, if there were schools to attend to, twice or
three times a day as well us church.
It being the last day of the old yer, MIr. Howard
had expressed a wish that Perry and Edward as well
as IlIerbert should attend church that afternoon, and
the lads, without the least reluctance, consented; Mr.
lIamilton and MIss IHIarcourt were going too, and

permission to accompany them. Ellen's pale suffering

of anything else, and remained for a very much longer

indecision. The next night was her children's ball, and
it was, too, the first day of a new ear-always in her
happy circle a festival of joy and thankfulness. Ellen's
face certainly looked as if she had suffered quite enough
to prevent the recurrence of her fault, but so it had
always done, and yet, before she could possibly have
forgotten its consequences, she failed again. MRs.
Milton sat for some time, after her children had left
her, in meditation, trying to silence the pleadings of
affection, and listen only to reason; as to whether con-
tinued severity or returning kindness would be the
more effective, and save both Ellen and herself any
further pain.
To the child herself physical suffering was so in-
creasing as gradually to leaden mental, till at last it
became so severe, that she felt sick and faint. She
knew the medicine she was in the habit of taking when

applied to her forehead, and which always succeeded in

Folle clung to her, imploring her not.
 Dear, dear Lewis, get me the medicine, and bathe my

two, without giving my aunt any trouble; pay, pray

nursing and soothing me; but I do not deserve that

 But indeed, MIss Ellen, she will be displeased if 1
do not. Why, only the other morning she was quite
concerned that I had not told her Jane was ill directly,
and went herself two or three times eery day to see she
had every thing proper and comfortable,''
But that is quite different, dear Well; do get the
motion; I feel as if I could not bear this pain much
longer without crying: you can tell her afterwards, if

Ellen leant her forehead against the side of her little

prevent the utterance of the hysteric sob that would
rise in her throat, though she did not know what it was.
But the wholly unexpected sound of MRs. IIamilton's
voice saying close by her, `I am afraid you have one
of your very bad headache, Ellen,'' so startled her, as
to make her raise her heal suddenly; and the move-
ment caused such agony, that, spite of all her efforts,
she could not present an almost convulsive cry of
pain.

was close at hand with the remedies she wanted, and she
repeated what the child hal said
`` Again your old mistake, Ellen. I could so much,
so very much rather hear yo say you were resolved to
desert my love, than that you did not merit it. Why
should you not deserve it as well as your brother and
cousins, if you determined with all your heart to try
and not do anything to lessen it? Nothing is so likely
to prevent your even endeavouring to deserve it, as the
mistaken fancy that you never shall; but you are too
well to listen to me now; we st try all we can to
remove this terrible pain, and then see if we can bring
back happiness too.''
And for above an hour did Mrs. IIamilton, with the
most patient tenderness, apply the usual remedies, cheered
by finding that, though much more slowly than usual,
still by degrees the violence of the pain did subside, and
the hysterical affection gie way to natural and quiet
tears. Exhaustion produced a deep though not very
long sleep, and after watching her some few minutes
very anxiously, MRs. IIanilton sat down by her bed, and
half unconsciously drew towards er Ellen's little Bible,
which Way open on the table, as if it had been only lately

eyes filled with tears as she read on one of them a little

Leaves in llis great mercy to forgive her sin, and
give her courage to speak the truth, to help her not
to be so frightened, but to guide her in her difficult
path. Mrs. lIIamilton little guessed how difficult it was,
but she hoped more from the effects of her present
existence than she had done yet. She had copietd, too,
several verses from the various parts of Old and New
Testament which were condemnation of falsehood, and
her aunt felt no longer undecided as to her course of
action.
 You have employed your solitary hours so well, my
dear Ellen,'' she said, as when the chill awoke, and
looked anxiously towards her-she kissed her cheek with
even more than her usual fondness--`` that I scarcely re-
quite your assurance of repentance or promises of amends-
ment. When you have taken some coffee, and think you
are well enough to listen to me, I will read you an illus-
tration of the fearful sin of falsehood from the Old
Testament, which I do not think I have yet pointed out
to you-Ananias and Sapphire: I see you remember.''
And when ellen had taken the delicious cup of coffee,
which her and had ordered should be ready for her
directly she awoke, and sat up, though her head was
still so weak it required the support of a pillow, yet she
seemed so revised, so almost damp, from the mesmeric
effect of that warm fond kiss, that her aunt did not
hesitate to continue the lesson she was so anxious to
impress, while the mind and heart were softened to re-
give it. She turned to the fourth chapter of the second
book of THings, and after briefly relating the story of
Newman,--for she did not wish to divert Ellen's attention
from the one important subject, giving anyone ideas,-

she read from the 2th else to the end, and so brought
the nature of Gazing's sin and its awful punishment,
at the hand of God himself (for the prophet was merely
an instrument of the eTernal, he had no power in him-
self to call the disease of leprosy on his servant) to
Ellen's mind, that she never forgot it.
Do you think English knew where he had been, and
what he had done before he asked him ?'' she ventured
timidly to inquire, as her aunt ceased;  Gazing had told
a falsehood already to Norman. Do you think God
punished that or his falsehood to Perish,?'
 Most probably he punished both, my love. Lights

absence, in fact he tells him so''-and she real the 26th

to give him an opportunity for a full confession of his
first sin, which then, no doubt would, after some slight
rebuke, hae been pardoned. It was a very great fault
at first, but the mercy of God was then, as it is now, so
infinite so forgiving, that, had English's question recalled
Chair to a sense of his great guilt and excited real
repentance, his punishment would hae been averted.
But his aggravated and repeated falsehood called down.
on him a chastisement most terrible even to think about.
Leprosy was not merely a dreadful disease in itself, but
it cut him off, from all the blessings and joys not only
of social life but of domestic; because, as Gold he said
it should cleave to lis sccd as well as to himself, he could
never find any one who would dare to love him, and he
must have been compelled to lonclyiscery all his life.''
 It was a very dreadful punishment,'' repeated Ellen,

It as, dearest; but it was merciful notwith-
standing. In God had passed it by, and permitted
Gazing to continue his sinful course, without any check
or chastisement, that would recall him to a sense of
better things, and a wish to pursue them, he might
have continued apparently very happy in this life, to be
miserable for her in the next; to be hnnishcd for ever
from God and IIi good angels; and would not that
have been still more dreadful than the heaviest suffering

the third chapter, and explained it, so that Ellen could
clearly understand it, and then said, ``And now, my
dear Ellen, can you quite understand and quite feel
why I have caused you so much pain, and been-as I

Te child had not, and her aunt, turning to the 129th,
read the first twelve and the two last verses carefully with
her, adding-
``Suppose you learn one verse for me every morning,
till you can repeat the whole fonrteen perfectly, and I
think that will help you to remember it, my Ellen, and
prove to me that you really are anxious to correct your-
self; and now one word more, and I think I shall have

Indeed, indeed I am not tired, ear Aunt,'' replied
Ellen, very earnestly; :I tell when you are talking to

and I am quite ready to attend you,''
The lights, the joyous voices, even er uncle's kind
greeting, almost oerpowered poor Ellen; as Perry, still
preserving his character of an admirable nurse, laid her
carefully on a couch in the sitting-room, where not
only tea was waiting, but the celebrated family tree,
which Mrs. IIamilton's anxiety and Ellen's sorrow had
caused them both to forget, was displayed with even
more than usual taste and beauty.
MIr. IIamilton, when young, had been a great deal
with his father in Germany, Remarks and Sweden,
and brought from the first and latter country certain
domestic observances which had especially pleased him,
as so greatly enhancing the enjoyment of home, and
helping to a right understanding between parents and
children, by increasing their mutual love and confidence.
The family tree, or Christmas Tree, as it was called,
was one of these, and from their earliest years it had
been one of the children's greatest delights on Ne
Year's Ee. Of course, as they grew older, and
their tastes improved, the tree itself, its suspended
presents, and its surrounding decorations increased in
beauty, and it had never been prettier than it was this
year. The whole of the preceding afternoon had the
young artists laboured in preparing it, for of course,
as the next day as Sunday, it was obliged to be all
finished by the Saturday night; the servants eager in
all things to enhance the happiness of those whose
parents made them so happy, did not care what trouble
they took to help them. They always selected the

room in which there was a very lofty and very deep
oricl window, in the centre of which ecess (which was
almost as large as a moderately sizedl room) they placed
te tree, which was a very large gracefully-cut spruce
for; it was placed in a tub filled with the same soil as
that in which the tree grew, so that by watering and
care it remained fresh for some time. The tub which
contained it, was completely hidden by the flowering
shrugs that were played round it, rising in an expanding
pyramid, by means of several flower-stands, till the
recess seems one mass of leaf and flower; amongst
which the superb scarlet geranium, that in Devonshire
grow so luxuriantly all through the winter, shining
against its own beautiful leaf, the brilliant berries of
the holly, with their dark glistening branches, the
snow-berry and flowering myrtle, shone pre-eminent.
Small lamps glittered through the flowers, and were
suspendcd in sufficient profusion from the pendent
branches of the tree to half real and half hide the
various gifts and treasures that were there deposited;
and altogether the effect from every part of the room
was really striking

could not all be done in private, no questions were ever

affection between the brothers and sisters were also
exchanged, that the tree was quite loaded, an many a
time had Mr. and MRs. Milton discovered some trait
of character or some ruling fancy, been in such a simple
thing as the manufacture and presentation of home
gifts. Their own idea of family ties was so strong and
so holy, that one great him in the education of their
choice was to make them not only low inch other,
but have thought and attention for individual feelings
and wishes, and so heighten feeling hy action, not
depend entirely on natural ties. MRs. Milton had
known many young persons who were parish in attend-
lions and even presents to friends, ut never imagined
that their own home circle had the first and strongest
claim to kindness, whether of word or deed. She knew
that affections and thought laished on comparative
strangers near raliatel on home, but that when given
to home first, they she light and kindliness far and near.
Their tea was indeed a mirthful one; ellen had been
very fearful of citing Mr. Hovard, for she thought
he must have been told how naughty she had been, but
if he had, there was nothing in his manner to say to:
for he shook hands with her, and even kissed her most
kindly, and told her, laugingly, that she must be quite
well by the next night, or how was she to dance? That
he thought it would be  good thing if Emmeline could
give her a little of her dancing mania, as she hardly
her only walked, even when she called herself quite
sober. Edward, every passing thought of self-reproach
banished h his sister's return to favour, was in the
wildest spirits; Percy and Emmeline seemed to have

as happy as the rest, and quite entering into their
mirth, and showing all sorts of little gentle attentions
to ELlen, who had seemed to shrink from his eye, more
than from all the others. Caroline fully entered into
the spirit of the evening, but neither she nor Miss
Harcourt took the same notice of Ellen as the rest.
The person who was to act the WViznrl's part, and by
means of a long and death the rarions treasures from
the tree, and carry them to the owners whose names
they bore, was always chosen by lot; and great as the
delight of the young party when this night the office
fell on MIr. Howard. No one seemed more pleased than
himself, performing it with such a spirit of enjoyment
and originality, that a general one declared him the
very choieest Wizard they had ever hal. To enumerate
all the contents of that marvellous tree would e im-

roll of cloth, down it come, right on MIr. TOwards's

as a joint offspring of love and respect. This good
man as so charmed, that he declared he would not us

watch in at night; and manufactured two little vessel

she promised him they should stand on the mantelpiece

Caroline had knitted her mother a very pretty bag,
and Emmeline nd Ellen had collected for her a variety
of leaves throughout the year, and arranged them with
great taste, both as to grouping and tinting, in a sort
of small verbal, with two or three lines of poetry,
selected and carefully written by each alternately,
attached to each page. Mrs. Ilamilton was excessively
pleased, as she was also with a portfolio formed by
drawings from both her boys, and tastefully made up
by MIss IIareourt; and with their gifts to their father,

which MIr. IIamilton had several months, if not more

that he would not exchange it for twenty of the most
precious volumes in his library. fSch evidences of the
home influence they had given, in permitting leisure
for the cultivation of taste and imagination, teaching
them the beautiful, and opening innumerable resources
of enjoyment within themselves, and thence allowing
them to enhance the pleasures of others, were indeed
most gratifying to those earnest and affectionate guard-
dans. From their earliest years they had been taught,
that to give the greatest amount of pleasure to their
parents, their gifts must be all, or at least have something
in them, of their own workmanship, and to enable them
to do this, te lads had been taught in their hours of
recreation to use all sorts of tools, visiting and knowing
something of a variety of handicrafts; and the girls to
work and draw, and even bring the stores of Nature to
their aid when needed, as in the present case, with
Emmeliue and eLlen's tasteful gift.

 Well sent for it at my breast, dear Caroline,''
answered Ellen. ` SHe said they were to be purchased
from the gardener at Powderham, and if it were possible
to send any one so far, she would endeavour to get on
for me; she told me yesterday she had succeeded, and I
thought she gave it you, as i begged her, directly; Had

uncle, kindly; ' and I really am glad that your great
desire to replace it made her think of sending for it, for
though I meant to have given Caroline another, Had so
many things on my mind this week that it escaped me;
and I know they are so much sought for, Watson has
scarcely ever one on hand,''
` Indeed, Papa, you were much too kind to think
about it at all,'' said Caroline, very earnestly. I am
afraid, if you knew how very cross and unkinl the loss
of the other made me, you would have withdrawn your
idea of such indulgence. I am very much obliged to
you, Ellen,'' she continues, much more cordially than
she had et spoken to her cousin ;  I did not deserve
it even from you, for I worked myself into such an ill

for, with this one coldness removed-though Mrs,
IIamilton's trembling heart dared not hope it would be

feeling increased when in the presents from their parents

dulgcenees were often given separatcly. There were a set

three or four months he had been most anxious to
possess; but with the recollection of former folly cry
fresh in his memory, he had actually succeeded in driving
them from his mind, and gave them up as unattainable,
till he was richer at least. For Herbert there was a fine
edition of the Wreck tragedians in their original, as
beautiful a work of art, in its `'getting up,'' as Percy
called it, as its letter-press, which to HErbert was beyond
all price. Edward was almost wild, as his uncle and
aunt telling him he was fourteen next MArch, and might
not be with the next Now Year's ere, presented him
with a treasure coeted beyond all other, a gold watch.

As MIr. and MRs. milton found that she could not
only comfortably `` exist,'' but much as she admired
and had at first so coveted it, as to have a hard
battle with discontent, she had never been lifted that
it might be useful. As they perceived that her mind

why it should be so carefully concealed, by the way in
which Ellen clung to her, as she bent over her to wish
her good night, with the same unrestrained affection as
her on Emmeline did so often, with the only difference,
that with the latter it seemed always to spring from the
very exuherance of happiness, which could only be thus

or the thought of their promised ball were the first
that entered the minds of the young party at Lowood,
as they opened their eyes on Ne Year's dAy, it was
not very unnatural. Perry gloried in the anticipation of
being master of the ceremonies, and in conducting the
whole affair with such inevitable grace and gallantry,
that very one should declare it was far superior to any
party, old or young, of the season, except Mr. TOwards's;
that aa beyond him, he said, for he could not put MIr.
Hoard's head on his shoulders. Herbert anticipated
the enjoyment of MAry Greville's society, talking to and
dancing with her undisturbed, and to hearing the almost
universal remark, hat a sweet girl she was. Edward
did not exactly know what he expected, but he was in
such a mood of hilarity and mischief, that the servants
all declared MAster Fortescue was `' maeed.'' T,
Cnroline their ball was almost always (though union-
fessedly) the happiest evening in her year. She knew
she was handsome-Anne Grave had told her how
very much she would he admired in London, and that
if she were not her very dearest friend, she should easy
her beauty terribly. She often in secret longed pain-
fully for admiration and homage; and, cold as she still
was in years, yet at her own house, and as MIr.

nonE 1PRESEnCE.
IIamilton's eldest ughter, in addition to her real
attraetions, she always received both in sulticicnt me-
sure, as to satisfy even herself. She delighted in those
evenings when it so clncel that her brothers had
young friends with them, making no hesitation in on-
fessing that she very much preferred conversing with
boys than with girls, there was so much more variety,
more spirit; nd though her mother's heart would
actually tremble at the fearful ordeal which an into-
action to the pleasures of the world would be to such
a character, still she would not check the open express-
sign of such sentiments by reproving them as wrong,
and not to be encouraged. She knew, that though
education might do much, very much, it could not
make natural characters all alike; nor, in fact, did she
wish it. She did not grieve and complain that, with
all her efforts, she could not make Caroline give her as
little trouble and anxiety as Emmeline, nor did she
imagine that she should see the effect of her earnest
prayers and cares all at once, or without constant re-
lapses in the cherished object of her care. She did
all she could to counteract a tendency which, situated
as she would be when she entered life, must, without
some strong high principle, lead to suffering, and, per-
haps, to sin-for what is coquetry? But she indulged
in no idea of security, never believe that because she
had so tired, so striven to how the good seed, it could
not fail to bring forth goad fruit. She knew many
trials might be in store for her, for how might she
hope to pass through life blessed as she was then?

if she failed not in her task, He would bring her joy
at last.
To Emmeline the idea of dancing as quite enough
to be the came of enjoyment. The only drawback was,
that in the intervals of rest there was to be a little music,
and though her mother had excused her at MIr. Howard's,
she knew that if anybody expressed a wish to hear her
at her own house, play she must; and at those times
she was half sorry she had chosen to learn the lamp in-
stead of the piano, as Caroline played so well on the
latter instrument, nobody would care to hear her; but the
harp was rather a novelty, and no little girl who was
coming played it, and so she was sadly afraid there was
no escape for her, and that was very disagreeable, but
he could not think about it till the time came; the
dancing to such music as MIr. IIamilton had ordered
from Plymouth was joy enough.
Ellen, though rather afraid of so many strangers,
could not resist the general contagion of anticipated
enjoyment. She did not indeed wake with the thought
of the all, but with the determination to hear the
verse of the Psalm her aunt had pointed out, and go
and say it to her in her dressing-room before she went
down. And as the first verse was very short, she
learned two, and repeated them without missing a
word, and so as if she quite understood them-that her
aunt was very much pleased and then Ellen could
think of and join her brother's and cousins' delight,
even though MRs. IIamilton was obliged to be what
she called very cruel, but what Ellen knew was very
kind, though it did seem a restraint, and keep her very
quiet all day, instead of letting her run about from

room to room, as Emmeline and Edward, and even
Percy did, for fear of another headache; and so well did
quietness succeed, that she looked and was unusually
well, and so was almost likely by the eveing.
Just before dinner, mercy, who had gone to ride, be-
cause he said he was sure he should get into some scrape
if he did not give a natural vent to his spirits, galloped
back in company with a gentleman, whose presence
seemed to occasion him still greater excitement

he asked impatiently, flinging his horse's rein to
Robert, desiring him to take eery care of the gentleman's
horse, as he should not let him leave Oakwood that
night; and then rushing across the hall, threw open
the door of their common sitting-room, and exclaimed-
MOther, give me a vote of thanks and praise for

monk of the moor, who, when I first encountered him,
seemed so doughty a denied of my wishes, actually

with very evident pleasure, and coming forward with
extended hand; ``your noisy welcome will not permit
mine to be heard. THis is, indeed, a pleasure, Mr.
Morton,'' he loved, addressing the young clergyman
with that earnest kindness, which always goes to the
heart, `and one that Mr. llamilton will most highly

them off, Mrs. Harilton, not in the wearing them,''
replied In. london, almost sadly; ``it is the knowledge,
that mingling as often in your home circle as Mr.
Milton and my friend Percy desire would wholly
unfit me for the endurance of my loneliness, that keeps
me so aloof, believe me. Inclination would act a very
different part, but there was no resisting such eloquence
and such happiness as his to-say,'' he continued, more
gaily
And Mr. Milton and Herbert entering as he spoke,
their greeting was quite as warm and eager as Percy's
and his mother's, and MIr. EMotion gave himself up for
the evening at least to enjoyment. His own generous
nature had been particularly struck h Percy's manly
conduct with regard to his satire, and different as were
their characters, a warm friendship from that moment
commenced between them. It was impossible to resist
Perry's warm-heartedness of word and deed; and that
he would sometimes lace his luxurious home, and stay
two or three days with MIr. EMotion, seeming actually ta
enjoy the rude cottage and its desolate localities, and
spread such a spirit of mirth within and around, that
it was no wonder the afflicted young man looked to his
society as almost his greatest pleasure, especially as he felt
he dared not too often accept Mir. Milton's continually
proffered invitation. Oakwood was the home which
had been his beau ideal for long years, but which now
seemed wholly unattainable. He felt himself doomed
to solitude and suffering, and the struggle for content
and cheerfulness was always more painful after he had
been with his friends.

INCOME 1SILENCE.
When all preparations for the evening were concluded,
even the respective toilettes completely, Percy and Em-
meline found it impossible to resist trying the spring,
as they called it, of the oaken floors (whence the ear-
pots had been removed), and amused themselves by
waiting in the largest circle they could make. The
beautiful suite of rooms were all thrown open, and per-
ceiling Caroline standing by the piano in an adjoining
apartment, Perry called out,-
Play us a waltz, Caroline, there's a love; the very
lirelicst you can find. in and I want to try the
boars while we can enjoy them to perfection, that is,
when e are the only persons in the room.''
 You must excuse me, Percy,'' she replied, somewhat
pettishly; I should think you would have dancing
enough in the course of the evening; and what will
our friends think if they come and find me playing?''
 Think? why that you are very obliging, which at
present you are not,'' answered Perry, laughing; ``never
mind, Emmy; let us try what our united lungs will o.''
You may if you like, Percy, but really I am not
clever enough to dance and sing at the same time-I
should have no breath left,'' was her as joyous rejoinder.
`Come and dance, Caroline, if you will not play;''
exclaimed Edward, who after moderating his button-hole
with a spring of holly, seemed seized with Perry's
dancing mania.
Do give me an opportunity of practising the graces
before I am called upon to display them.''
 MY love of dancing is not so great as to attempt it
without music, so practise by yourself, Edward,'' was
Caroline's quick reply.

brother, very drily; and as Declined begged him not
to tease her, he asked-
 WHat has put her in this ill-humour, Emmy?''
e Oh, I don't know exactly; but if you let her alone,
she will soon recover it,''
Well, to please you, I ill; for you look so pretty
to night, I cannot resist you.''
Take care, Perry, if you try to turn my head with
such speeches, I shall go to Edward and punish you by
not waiting with you,'' said his little sister, shaking
her head at him with a comic species of reproach.
ThAt's right, may; do not the flutter been from
a brother,'' said her father, coming forward with a smile;
'but will you not tire yourself by dancing already ?''
Oh no, Papa; I feel as if 1 could dance all night
without stopping.''
Not with me, Emmeline,'' rejoined Perry, shrugging
his shoulders with horror at the side; ``I should cry
you mercy, before one half the time and elapsed,''
 But if you are not to be tired, will you not spoil
your dress, and disorder all these flowing curls,'' con-
tinued MIr. Milton, ``and surely that will be a great
misfortune,''
` Indeed, it will not, Papa; Perry has surely too
much regard for me, to wilfully hurt my frock, and if
my hair should be so troublesome as to get out of order
Fancy will rearrange it in a few minutes,''
If you wish to cause alarm on that score, my dear
father,'' said mercy, with marked emphasis, ``you must
go to Caroline not to Emmeline. Thank goodness, I
have one sister shoe such petty misfortunes.''
Are you not too hard upon Caroline, Percy?'

Yes, Papa, he is, indeed; do not mind what he
says,'' answered immense, very eagerly; but Perry
said impetuously-
'I am not, kmmeline. I would lay by water that
something has gone wrong with her dressing to-night,
and so made her pcttish. He frock is not smart enough,
or she does not wear the ornaments she wished, or some
such thing.''
Caroline had fortunately quitted the music-room, or
this such would not he tended to restore her
serenity; but before Mr, IIamilton could reply, Edward,
who had been to seek ellen, burst into the room, ex-
claiming--
Now, Percy, we may have a proper waltz; Aunt
Emmeliue says we may have just one, before any one
comes, and here she is to play for us, and Ellen for my
partner,'' and they enjoyed it in earnest. MIr. Milton
watched them for a few minutes, and then went to seek
his elder girl.
She was alone in a little room prepared for refreshments
tastefully arranging some beautiful flowers in a bouquet.
She looked up as he entered, and so smile that her
fond father thought Percy must be wrong, for there
certainly seemed no trace of ill-temper.
Why are you not with your brothers and sister in
the drawing-room, my dear and why did you just now
refuse your brother such a trifling for as playing a
way ?'' he asked, but so kindly, that Caroline, though
she blushed deeply, instantly relied-
`Because, Papa, my temper was not quite restored;

indeed, Papa,'' she added, looking up earnestly in his
face, ``indeed, he is very provoking sometimes,''
I know he is, my love; he does not always know
how to time his jokes, or to make sufficient allowance
for dispositions not exactly like his own; but tell me,
what first occasioned temper so to fail that solitude
was necessary.''
Caroline's blush became still deeper, and she turned
away her head, saying, very hesitatingly-
 For such a very, very silly reason, Papa, that I do
not like to tell you.''
Nay, my dear, do not fear that I shall either laugh
at or reproach of. If you feel yourself how very
silly it was, I am not afraid of its gaining too great
ascendency, even if you fail again,''
'It was only-only-that I was not quite satisfied
with the dress Mamma desired me to wear to-night,
Papa; that was all, indeed.''
You wished, perhaps, to wear a smarter one, my
love,'' replied her father, kissing her glowing cheek so
ffectionately, that the pain of her confession was in-
scanty soothed;  but, indeed, I think Flamma has
shown a much better taste. It requires more care than
you are yet perhaps aware of, to dress so exactly accord-
ing to our age and station as to do ourselves justice, and
yet excite no unpleasant feelings in those of a lower, and
no contempt in those of a higher, grate. MAny of our
friends who are coming to-night could not afford to
dress their children as we might ones, an do you not
think it would be both inhospitble and unkind, by
being over-dressed, to excite any unpleasant feeling of
inferiority in their minds, when actually none exists?

for difference of fortune alone can never coustitute
inferiority. I am izard enough to guess that was

guess your reason for wishing to be smarter-shall 1

scarlet geranium in the rich dark hair that shaded
Caroline's noble brow; ``and if mamma inquires, tell

approbation, for temper conquered and truth unhesita-

Caroline's brilliant eye sparkled with a more delight-
ful sense of pleasure than any triumph of dress could
have bestowed, and in answer to her father's inquiry,
for whom she had arranged such a beautiful bouquet,
she said-

young clergyman could not but admire the natural
grace with which Cnroline, after warmly welcoming her
guests, presented her flowers to her mother. It was a
very little thing, hut the joys and griefs of home are
almost all made up of little things, and Mrs. Ilamilton
was pleased, not from the attention alone, but that it
proved, trifling as it was, that the annoyance and dis-
content which her command had occasional in her
child had left no nnkind feeling behind them, and the
manner with which she received it made Caroline very
happy, for she had inwardly feared her ill-temper not
only deserved, but had excited, her mother's displeasure.
Emmeline's look of disappointment and selfreproach
at her own unusual forgetfulness was so irresistibly
comic, that Percy and Edward burst into an immoderate
fit of laughter, which the former only checked to ask
Caroline where she had been, and what she had done,
to produce such an extraordinary change for the better
in her appearance in so short a time.

removed anything like stiffness or reserve which the
younger guests might have at first experienced amongst
themselves. After to or three quadrilles, the spirit
of enjoyment seemed to reign alone, not only amongst
the dancers themselves, but even those who sat out and
talked, either from preference or bceenuse the sets were
full. Percy, his brother, and cousin were so active, sa
universal in their attention and politeness, that all had
the same measure of enjoyment; there was no sitting
down four or five times consecutiely for any one, and
therefore neither weariness nor dissatisfaction. Where
there is a great desire in the tiers of a party to make
every one as happy as themselves and thoroughly to
enjoy it, they seldom fail to succeed. And there was
such a variety of amusements in the various rooms that
were thrown open, suitable for all ages-fro the
mamma and papa to the youngest child, that it was
scarcely possible to feel anything but pleasure. Very
many sets had been formed and danced before the
Grandam family appeared, and as Caroline glanced at
her friend and even her little sister, it required a very
vivid recollection of her father's words to prevent a
feeling of false shame, while Annie looked at Emmeline
and even her favourite Caroliue for a few minutes with
almost contempt.
People talk so very much of Mrs. Ilamilton's taste,'
she thought, ``but she can he none in dress, that's
certain-why no one call distinguish her daughter
fro the poorest gentleman's ere !--But no one can
mistake my rank. Thank goodness, there is not a dress
like mine-how it will be envied .''

If looks were evidence of envy, Annie had them to
her heart's content, but how would she had been for-
friend, could she had read the secret meaning of those
looks, the contrast drawn between the manners and
appearance of Lady Helen's daughters and those of the
INexorable Mrs. Ilamilton. Lady Helen herself, indeed,
when she saw Caroline and Feeling, was quite provoked
that she had been so weak as to permit, and ere en-

not choose to come before-indeed, my patience and my

 I suppose Annie was thinking of her London par-

and forget such superior pleasures to-night, my dear
girl,'' she added, jestingly, though the young lady felt it
rather uncomfortably as earnest, ``or i fear you will
find but little amusement.'' Alfred Greville at that
moment came to claim Annie as his partner, and she
gladly joined him, for though MRs. Milton had ``her-

in her presence. Cecil and Villa were soon provided
with little partners, and dancing with much more real
delight than their sister.
It was scarcely possible for any one, much less a
parent, to look at Caroline that night without admire-
lion. She was so animated, so graceful, so pleasing, and
as such completely the centre of attraction (and really
without any effort on her part) to all the gentlemen,
young or old in the room. The lads congregated round
her, and it was rather a difficult task to keep clear of
offence, when so very many more entreated her to dance
than the length of the evening permitted; but she ma-
aged to talk to all, and yet not to neglect any of her
own sex, for she always refused to dance, if she fancied
her being in the quadrille prevented any couple who
had not danced so much, and at those times contrived
to conciliate five or six instead of only one. Emmeline
took charge of the younger children, often refusing to
dance with older boys, who would have made her much
pleasanter partners, that she might join the little
quadrille, and set them all right.
I am really glad to see Ellen amongst us to-night,
and seeming truly to enjoy herself,'' said MRs. Greville,
addressing Mrs. IIamilton, who was standing rather
part at the moment, watching Carolinc with such men-
glad feelings of pride and dread, that she was quite glad
when her friend's voice disturbed her train of thought.

That it was not illness which prevented her ; but she
looked so confused and pained that I changed the sun-

 You touched on a very painful theme,'' replied MRs.
IIamilton, with real relief;  Ellen and I were not quite
as good friends as we usually are last week, and my
poor little girl felt my severity more than i imagined or
meant. I gave her to your dear MAry's especial care to-
night, for she is so timid, that, left quite to herself, 1
was afraid it would be more pain than pleasure. MAry
has taken my hint most admirably, for ellen seems
quite happy.''
'It would be rather hard, if your little niece's were
the only sad face in this scene of enjoyment; surely,
if ever there were happiness without alloy, it is here,''
If you think so, Mrs. Reilly, you will agree with

den The idea that childhood is in itself the happiest
season in life is so far mischievous, that it presents the
necessary care and watchfulness, which alone can make
it so. But we must not philosophise any more, for it
has made us all grace. I see my wife is addressing MIss
Ashamed, and I think it is for music. Come, Iron,

guests, young and old, second the move: Annie
Ashamed really played remarkably well, so far as expect-
lion and brilliancy were concerned, all Mrs. Milton
was delighted at the expression of Grace's face as he
listened to his child and the applause she exerted.  WHy

' when he is so formed to enjoy them  and why, why has

which Lady ELlen's face presented to her husband's;
she knew annie played well, she had heard it from very
superior judges, and how could it concern her what
the present company thought ?
A very pretty vocal duet from the two sisters followed,
and soon afterwards Caroline approached the music-
stand, near which Prey and MIr. EMotion were talking,
and Percy, with his usual love of provoking, exclaimed-

Indeed, my dear Miss Milton, ours excced

merely superintend,''
Caroline was seated at the instrument as he spoke,
and there was something in his few words touching a
right chord; for as she began to play she certainly
thought more of her mother than any one else; and
determined, if possible, that others should think with MIr.
EMotion, forgetting at the moment that very few, except
their own immediate circle, knew whose pupil she was,
not imagining that the mistress of Onkwood and its
large possessions could have time or inclination for any
part of the education of her daughters. EMotion was

Herbert approached, and eagerly whispered some request.

mine be enough ?'"
 What, with Mary? I rather think, your request in
this case will be of more weight than mine;'' and a few
minutes afterwards Mrs. Milton led the blushing
timid girl in triumph to the piano. PIer voice, which
was peculiarly sweet and thrilling, though not strong,
trembled readily as she commenced; but IIerbert was
turning over the leaves of her music, his mother was

been blue earnest eyes, the hectic colour that with the
least exertion rose to her cheek, the transparency of
complexion, te warm and elevated spirit, the almost
angel temper and endurance in er peculiarly tried lot,
that scarcely seemed of earth; and never was that sad
forcboding stronger than at that moment, as she looked
round the crowd of young and happy faces, and none
seemed to express the same as MAyor's. She could
scarcely command her voice and smile sufficiently to
warmly thank her young fortune as she ceased; but
MAry was more than satisfied by the fond pressure of
her hand.
This little interruption to the actual business of the
evening only increased the zest and enjoyment, when
dancing recommenced. Even the call to supper was
obeyed with reluctance, and speedily accomplished, that
they might return the sooner to the ball-room. The
ours had worn away it seemed on gossamer-wigs, and
as each happy child felt assured that the delight could
not last much longer, the longing to dance to the very
last moment seemed to increase. Emmeline's excitable
spirit had thrown of all alloy, for it was quite impossible
any one would think of asking her to play how; she had
arranged all the remaining couples-for the room had
been very much to thin-for the favourite IIaymaker's

if she would verify her own words, and dance all night.
MIss Ashamed had declared it was much too great a
romp, and declined joining it. Cnroline who would
have enjoyed it, out of more politeness ta her friend
than inclination, sat down with her, and a cheerful
group of some of the older lads, and one or two young
Ladies joined them. IIerbert and Mary, finding the
quadrille for which they were engaged, changed to a
dance for which, though they had quite the spirit, they
had not the physical strength, enjoyed a quiet chat
instead, and Ellen seated herself by her favourite Mary,
declining, from fatigue, Alfred Grerille's entreaty that
she would second Emmeline.
i declare I could dance myself with that merry
group,'' exelimel Mr. Ashamed, after watching them
some time, and all his austerity banished by the kind
spirit of the evening. ``MRs. IIamilton, MRs. Grerille,

Both lies laughingly begged to be excused, offering
however, to introduce him to a partner.
No; it must be one of you or none at all. That

she and Edward will go, and the rest follow just like
a pack of cards. Do, pray, present such a catastrophe,
for I assure you it is not in the least unlikely.''
The gravity with which he spoke caused a general
laugh; but Mrs. IIamilton, feeling by the length of time
the fatiguing dance had lasted, there was really some
truth in his words, desired the musicians to stop;
cansing an exclamation of regret and disappointment
from many youthful lips, and Emmeline and Edward
an up to her, to entreat that they might go on a little
longer. MRs. lIamilton, however, refused; and Edward
yielded directly, but Emmeline was so much excited,
that obedience was most unusually difficult; and when
her mother desired her to sit down quietly for ten
minutes, and then come to the music-room, as Mrs.
Allan most particularly wished to hear her play before
she left, she answered, with more petulance than she
was at all aware of,-
I am sure I cannot play a note now-it will be no
use trying.''

I am afraid you have danced too much, instead of

The tone, still more than the work, was enough;
poor Emmeline was just in that mood when tears are
quite as near as smiles; her own petulance seemed te
reproach her too, and she suddenly burst into tears.

:Do not make me more shame of you, Lmmeline.

PIer little girl's only answer was to bury her face still
more closely in her mother's dress, very much as if she
would like to hide herself entirely; but on MIss. Allan
saying, very kindly-
Do not distress yourself, my dear. I would not
have asked to hear you play, if I had thought youwonld
dislike it so much. I dare say you are very tired, and
so think you will not succeed,''
She raised her head directly, shook back the fir
ringlets that had fallen over her face, and though
tears were still on her cheeks and filling her eyes,
said, with a blending of childish shyness and
courteous truth, impossible to be described:

was too tired to play, and what careful training must it
had been to have so taught truth.
 MRs, Allan would not ask you before, because she
knew you did not like to play while the room was so
very full; therefore, ought you not to do your very best
to oblige he?'
Emmeline looked timidly up in her mother's face,
to be quite sure that her displeasure had subsided, as
her words seemed to denote; and quite satisfied, her
tears were all checked, and taking MIss, Allan's offered
hand, she went directly to the music-room.
MRs. IIamilton lingered to desire Herbert (who had
come up to know the cause of his sister's sudden tears]
to form the last quadrille, and reserve a place, if he
possibly could, for Emmeline, as they would not begin
till she had done. Her little girl was playing as she
rejoined her, and it really was a pretty picture, her fairy
figure with her tiny harp, and her sweet face seeming
to express the real feeling with which she played. There
was no execution in the simple Highland air, but her
vivid imagination lent it a meaning, and so, when fairly
playing, she did not mind it. MRs. Allan had lost a
little girl just at merlin's age, who had also played
the harp, and there was something in her caress and
thanks after she had done that made Emmeline stand
quietly at her side, without heeding the praises that
were laished round her. IIerhert at that moment
appeared with one of the young Allans.
Come, Emmy, we are only waiting for you; Mr.
Allan say you hnse not favoured him to-night, and he
hopes you will now.''

 Pray do,'' added MRs. Allan, as her son gaily
pleaded his own case; Emmeline only waited to real
her mother's consent in her eyes, for she thought that
she ought not to dance any more; and in another
minute the joyous music had resounded, and she was
dancing and clatting as gaily and happily as if there
had been no interruption to her joy.
`' And you will leave all these delights to imprison
yourself in a man-of-wa?'' asked Mr. Ashamed, jestingly
of Ward, while waiting for his wife and daughters,
who were the last departures (much to aNnie's horror,
for it was so unfashionable to he quite the last), to be
cloakel and shawled.

once tried the conceit,''
I do not think I shall,'' answered Edward, earnestly;
I know there are many hardships, and I dare say I
shall find them more disagreeable than I can possibly
imagine; but I shall get used to them; it is so cowardly
to care for hardslips.''

put his arm affectionately round Ellen, ``my sister has
so many kind friends that she will be able to spare me
till I am old enough to do all a brother ought''
 You are a good fellow, Edward, and I see I must
not talk of parting, if I would preserve this evening's
pleasure unalloyed,'' Ashamed said, as he laid his
hand kindly on Ellen's head, and then turned to obey
the summons of his wife.
The young party no doubt felt that it would be in-
flnitely more agreeable to sit up all night and talk of
the only too quickly concluded enjoyment, than to
retire to their respective pillows; but the habits of
Oakwood were somewhat too well regulated for such
dissipation, though, no doubt, their dream-land that

and, according to their respective source of enjoyment,

that he did not care at all when the time of work

and sought his mother, by eery fond attention on his
part, to remove the pain of Caroline's conduct.
This continued for about a fortnight, at the end of

Ioerbhert hoped his expostulations were taking effect;
MIr. IInmilton trusted that her child was becoming
sensible of her past folly, and trying to conquer it, and
banish its memory herself: both, however, were mistaken.
Annie Rather had imparted to her friend, in strict
confidence, that her mother intended giving a grand
ball about the end of February, nd meant to entreat
MIr. Milton, as a person four, to let Cnroline be

The invitations (three weeks' notice) for her parents

included, but when above a week passed, and still not
a word was said, disappointment took the place of hope,
and it was only the still lingering belief that she might

of ill-temper.
Now Lady SIlent really hal asked, though she did
not persuade; and MRs. IIamilton thanked her, but, as
she expected, decidedly refuse. ` Cnroline was much

MRs. IIamilton quite forgot that MIss Ashamed was not

absence. She left on the Saturday, and the Thursday

detained Edward as he was leaving the library, after
morning prayers, and told him that he had received a
letter, which he thought might chance to interest him.
Ten minutes afterwards, Edward rushed into the break-

MRs. lIamilton could not speak at the first moment,
for the joy, the animation of her nephew so recalled the
day when her own much-loved brother, her darling
Charles, had rushed into her room, to tell her all his
glee, for no one ever listened to and shared in his joys and
troubles as she did. DIe was then scarcely older than
Edward, as full of hope and joy and buoyancy,-where
was he? Would his fate be that of the bright beautiful
boy before her and as Edward threw his arms round

she wished him joy too, it was the utmost effort to pre-

and felt bewildered. he had always tried to realize
that Edward, to be a sailor, must leave her; and in fact,
aware that his summons would soon come, her aunt and
uncle had often alluded to his departure before her, but
still she had never thought it near; and now the news
was so sudden, and Edward was so wild with joy, she

I expected,'' MRs. Milton said, as she entered the
school-room, and found the three girls preparing their
books, ``so I must set you all to work, and see how well
you can get on without me till ellen, when I will rejoin
you. I shall order the carriage at half-past twelve, and
if all I require is completed, we will pay your favourite
old ruin a visit, eMpty; the morning is so lovely, that
I think we may venture to take our sketch-books, and
see what other part of Berry Poverty we can take pen-

Such an anticipation was quite enough for Emmeline.
Her dance about the room as only checked by the
idea that her lessons would never be ready, nor her ex-
rises and sums done, unless she sat quietly down, and
so, with a great effort, she gave all her attention to her
various tasks, and mastered them even before her mother
returned. Ellen, though she tried quite as much, was
not so successful. The Prince William would sail in
miniature on her slate, over all her figures. The recoil-
section of the awful storm they had encountered on their
eyes to England would return so vividly, that the
very room seemed to hear. And then-but she could
not make out whose should think about that then,-her
mother' s death-bed came before her, and her promise, and
it seemed harder still to part with Edward, from a vague
dread that came over her, but still she tried to attend
to what she had to do, and congratulated herself on its
completion before her aunt appeared

Ellen bed direct; a little care, and with the
assistance of her grammar, which her aunt permitted
her to refer to, instead of lepending entirely on her
memory that morning, enabled her to succeed with her
French; but four times was that tormenting sum re-
turned, till at last her tears effaced the figures as fast as
they were written. Still, patience and resolution in
both teacher and pupil conquered, and the fifth time

putting back the heavy ringlets which in Ellen's absorbed

Shall I tell you a secret, my little Ellen? I was
quite as disinclined to be firm this morning as you were
to be patient; so you see we have both gained a grand
victory. In conjuring propensities, as Emmy thinks
them, told me that you had real cause for some little
inattention, and, therefore, that it was very cruel in me
to be so determined; but my judgment would tell me
that my feeling was wrong, and that to conquer dis-
inclination and overcome a difficulty, was a much better
way of lcssening even natural sorrow than to give up.

Ellen was so glad, that she felt almost happy, and her

lIlamilton had been so kind as to coutermand the car-
rage till one, that she and Caroline might have the to
finish. But Caroline, if she had not tried before, was
of still less capable of doing so. Eery word of kind-

within, and the difficulty of restraining it in MRs.
Hamiltaon's presence caused it to burst forth with un-
mitigated violence the moment she quitted the apart-
ment, desiring Emmeline and Ellen to make haste, and
put away their books, but still without taking the least
notice of her. Inectirce, reproach, almost abuse, were
poured against Ellen, who stood actually frightened at
the violence she had so very innocently excite, and at
the fearful and deforming passion which inflamed her
cousin's every feature. Caroline's anger ad miscounted
time, or she must have known that her mother could
not have gone far enough, for such unusual tones of
excitement to escape her quick hearing. MRs, Milton,
startled and alarmed, returned directly, and so idly
in her child's appearance and words recall her own
misgnidedt sister in those uncontrolled fits of fry, under
which she had so often trembled, that present disappoint-
ment, and dread for the future, took possession of her,
and for the moment rendered her powerless. Caroline was
too much engrossed to perceive her at first, and she had,
therefore, time to rally from the momentary weakness.

Wat does this mean 7'' she exclaimed, fixing her
eyes on Caroline, with that expression of quiet but stern
reproof, which, when she did nose-and it as very

abuse her with this unjust and cruel and most unfeminine
violence? You hae indulged your ill-temper till you do
not know what you say or do, and you are venting on
another the anger which my displeasure has caused you
to feel towards me, and towards yourself. I desire that
you will control it directly, or retire to your own room,
till you can behave with some degree of propriety, and
not disturb the comfort and happiness of others in
this most uncalled-for manner.''
I will not go,'' answered Caroline, bursting into
violent tears, and scarcely aware of what she was saying.
I know I dislike Ellen, and I had reason to dislike
her, for before she came, you were never so often dis-
pleased with me; you are always kind and indulgent to
her, always treat her as a reasonable being, not as the
child, the infant you think me. I know you have lost
all late for me, or you must have seen lI was unhappy.

every reason to dislike her, stealing your affection from

Go, and prepare for our drio, my dear children,''
Mrs. HIamilton said, as she calmly turned for a moment
to Emmeline and Ellen, who both stood bewildered, the
former from actual terror, that her sister should dare sa
address her mother, the latter from pain at te violent
avowal of a dislike which she had intuitively felt, but had
always tried to disbelieve.  The beauty of the day will

be disappointed of our promised ramble. Do not think
anything of what this unhappy girl is lying; at present,
she scarcely knows herself, and will by-and-by will it

Emmeline longed to throw her arms round her mother,
and with tears bteseech her to forget what Caroline had
said; but, though Mrs. Milton had spoken cheerfully,
and in quite her usual tone of voice to them, there was
something in her countenance, that checked any display
of softness even in her affectionate child ; something that
almost awed her, and she left the room with Ellen to
prepare for the promised excursion, which had, however,
lost all its anticipated enjoyment from the uneontrolled
temper of another.
Now, Caroline, I will answer you,'' said Mrs.
IIamilton, as soon as they were alone, and again regard-
ing Caroline, who was sobbing violently, with that same
searching look.  Your charges are such very heavy ones,
that I really must request you during my absence to
arrange and define them in some order. I am so per-
exactly ignorant of having given you any foundation for
them, that, before I can attempt defence, you must
inform me exactly and definitely of what you complain.
That this morning my manner was kinder to Ellen than
to you I quite acknowledge. Her inattention and de-
passion had a cause, hours had none; for if you were
unhappy, it was from your own fearful temper, which
by eneouragement has blackened eery thing around
you. You may employ your time till dinner as you
choose; but at five o'clock come to me in my dressing-

command, Caroline, diasregard or evasion of which will
be disobedience.''
She left the room, and in a very short time afterwards
Caroline heard the carriage live off; hut for nearly
three long hours she never moved from her seat, s
utterly miserable, as scarcely even to change her position.
Never in her life before, not in her most angry moments,
had she so spoke to her mother, and her remorse was
almost intolerable. Again and again she remembered
what MIss. Milton had told her so often, that, if she
ll not strive and pray against the dominion of ill-them-
per while young, it would become more and more un-
cantrollablce, and the older she became, the more iflieult
to subdue, even in a moderate degree, and her words
were indeed true. It had been many months since
temper had gained such an ascendeney, and its effects
were far, far more violent, and its power over her more
determined, and if, as she grew older, it should be still
worse, what would become of her? how insufferablg
whether. wat would she not e given to hare re-
called her words?' The jealousy which had arisen, no
she knew not how, had sunk into air before those he
calm inquiring sentences for her mother, and in her
excessive misery every kind deed and work and look,
every fond indulgence and forbcaranee, in fact, all ti
love her mother had so lavished on her from her infancy,
rushed back upon her, till she actually hated herself,
and longed the more intensely for the comfort of that
soothing affection, which, in real pain or childish sorrow,
had never hcen refused her.

hateful ball ?'' she exclaimed, at length, as the sound
of many joyous voices and the dressing-bell pro-
claimed the return of the various members of her
family only in time to prepare for dinner.  It was
all, all from that; I know now, one from that one
thought-one wish. Why was IN such a fool, as not
to tell MAmma at once that I knew I was to be asked,
and wished so much to go?-if she had refused me, it
would not have been half the pain I have made for
myself. And how can I meet Papa's eye and Percy's
unkind jokes with eyes like these?'' she added, as,
on rising to go to her own room, she caught sight of
her own face in a mirror, and actually startled at the
disfigurement, which the violence of her emotion had
wrought. Oh, how I wish MAmma bad to desired
me to go to her; that I could but hide myself from
everybody-or get rid of tis horrible have cloud,''
From every eye but her mother's she could and did
hide herself; for saying that her head ached, which
was the truth, and she did not wish anything to take,
she refused to go down to dinner. MRs. lHIamilton had
sueeessfully exerted herself during their excursion, and
Emmeline and Ellen enjoyed themselves so thoroughly
as almost to forget the alloy of the morning; and even
when Caroline's message recalled it, the boys were all
so merry, that it did not disturb them. Percy always
declared that Caroliue's headache was only another
term for temper-ache, and he would certainly here sent
her sone message of mock pity, if his quick eye had
not discovered or fancied that his mother did not look
quite as well as usual, and so he contentel himself by
trying still more to her the life of the dinner-tale. Mr,

IIamilton had seen at a single glance that all was not
quite right, and Caroline's non-appearance and message
explained it, to his extreme regret, for he had begun to
hope and believe that his wife's extreme solicitude, on
her account, was heginiug to decrease,
MRs. IIamilton had not much doubt that silence and
solitude had so far had effect on Caroline as to subdue
passion, and bring her to a sense of her misconduct;
but that ad scarcely power to lessen the anxiety and
the pain which Caroline's words had so wantonly in-
flicted. IIal she indeed evinced anything like undue
partiality -the side alone almost brought a smile;
fondly, and almost as her own child, as she loved her
little niece. The very anxiety Caroline oeeasioned her
opened her affection; the very control she was
obliged to exercise in her mode of guiding her, strength
end every feeling towards her. She was so enwrapped in
these painfully engrossing thoughts, in the street es-
examination of her own heart, that she was not aware the
time she had appointed had passed by full ten minutes,
till she was caused by the handle of her door being
softly turned, and left again, as if some one had wished to
enter, but hesitated. The very hesitation one her
hope, for she really did not know that the utmost
penalty she could have inflicted on Cnroline, in the
moment of natural indignation, would have failed in
producing such an effect as the simple command to
seek her, and define her chargcs against her, when that
angry excitement had so calmed, that Caroline would
have given worlds, if she might but he not referred
to it again. She knew she dared not disobey, but her
daring had left her so powerless that she had stool at

command courage sufficient to open it ad enter.
Mrs. HIamilton looked at her changed aspect, the bitter
humiliation expressed in every feature, with such pity,
that it required even more than her usual exercise of
control, to retain the grave and apparently unmoved
tone with which she said-
You have had a long time in which to reflect on
your charges against me, Caroline. I hope they are
now sufficiently defined for me to understand and answer
them. You may sit down, for you do not seem very
capable of standing.''
Caroline gallery obeyed, by sitting down on a low
ottoman, some little distance from her mother, on whose
neck she absolutely longed to throw herself and heseech
forgiveness; but MIss. IIamilton's tone was not such as
to give her courage to do so. She remained silent,
burying her face in her hands.
I am waiting your pleasure, Caroline; I should have
thought that you had had plenty of time to think
luring my absence. Of what do you aecuse me?''
oH, nothing, nothing Mamma, dear MAmma, do

No, Cnroline; were I to condemn you to any

partiality and injustice, than from the one of producing
any good end. You are no longer a child, who must

now as well as I can teach it, and if you fail, must be
nanswverable only to yourself. I cannot help you any
further, than by requesting you to explain clearly the
origin of your complaint against me. Its main ground
of offence is, I believe, that since Ellen as become a
inmate of my family I have treated you with more
harshness and unkindness than I ever did before. Can
you look back on the last eighteen months and recall
one instance in which this has been the case' I must
have an answer, Caroline; you may not think place-
nation is not necessary, and that you meant nothing
when you spoke, but that will not satisfy me nor you,
when ill-temper remains ascendeney. You need not
refrain from answering for fear of bounding me, you
can scarcely do that more than you have done already,''
Caroline tried to speak, but she could only so forth,
that she could not recall one instance, in which her
mother had been more displeased with her than her
conduct merited. Acknowledging, but almost artist-
lately, that she had sometimes fancied that she had
remained longer cold with her than with Ellen, after
the committl of a fault-and that-(she stopped.)
 Go on, Caroline.''

the faults she has. You cannot compare yourself with
her, for hal you been situated as she was, I fear you

1 should ever have told untruths,'' exclaimed
Caroline, with returning temper.
 Perhaps not, for some persons are so physically
constituted that they do not know what fear is; and
harshness would harden, not terrify and crush, as with
such dispositions as Ellen's. But Caroline, when temper
gains dominion over you, as it has done to-day, do
you always think and utter nothing but the truth?''
Caroline turned from that penetrating look and burst
into tears. Few is the words were, they seemed to
flash light into the very inmost recesses of her heart,
and tell her, that in her moments of uncontrolled
temper, in her brooding fancies, she really did forfeit
the truth, an adherence to which she so prided herself;
and that there was no excuse for her in the idea that
she did not know what she said or did-for why had
religion and reason hee so carefully implanted within
her, but to while her to subdue the evil temper ere
it acquired such fearful dominion.
Perhaps you have never thought of this before,
Caroliue,'' resumed MRs. IIamilton, and her tone was
not quite so cold; but think of it in future, and it
may help you to conquer yourself. Remember world

she would atone for her fault at last by a full confess-
soon. She told all the wishes, the hopes Annie's in-
formation of Lady Helen's promise had imparted, and
the pain it was to feel that her mother thought her such
a child as not to speak to her on the subject.
``And if you did think so, Caroline, why did young,
from the first moment that Annie told you of it, come to

Caroline looked hastily up; her mother's tone was
almost as fond is usual, and, unable to restrain the
impulse any longer, she started from her low seat, and
kneeling down close by her, clung round her, passion-
lately exclaiming-
MAmma MInmmal pray forgive me;I am so
very miserable--I cannot bear myself-I do not
low when I shall be happy again; for even if you
forgive me, I know-I know-I never can forgive
myself,''
i1 do not wish you to forgive yourself just yet, my
dear child,'' replied her mother, not refusing the kiss
Caroline's eyes so earnestly besought.  Your fault
has been such an aggravated one, that I fear it must
cause you many days of remorse, the most painful kind
of suffering which error can bring; hut do not try to
shake it off; I would rather see you endure it, and not
expect happiness for a few days. You know where
to seek the only source which can bring peace and
comfort, and you must endeavour hy earnest prayer to
strengthen yourself for the conflict you have so often to
encounter. You have a very difficult task, my poor
child, that I know; and, therefore, do I so try to
provide you with a guard and help.''

and answer pettishly, and as if it were pleasanter to
encourage disagreeable thoughts the to rend or do
anything that would removed them. And then, when I
would give anything to escape from them, it seems
everybody's fault but my own, and I cannot.''
If rou accustomed yourself constantly to pry
against this great fault, my dear child, you would find,
that its very first approach would so startle you, that
you would use every energy to subdue it. MInute I fear,
Caroline, it is only when temper has made you miserable,
as it has to-say, that you are quite aware of its enormity.
You do not think the fault great enough to mind the
watchfulness and care, without which it never will be
subdued'
1 am afraid I do not indeed, MAmma. I know I do
not make it a subject of prayer, as you have so often
advised me, except when everything looks so black,
and I am so miserable; and then, I can, I ask more
to be happy again, the for forgiveness of my sin,
and for grace and strength to overcome it. I never felt
this to be the case so strongly as to-day, it your cold-
ness seems to have shown me my whole self, and
I never thought I was so wicked, and so I must be
miserable.''
MRs. IInmilton involuntarily drew her chill more
closely to her. The humility, the bitterness of self-
reproach, was so unlike Caroline's usual haughtiness-
so very much deeper than they had ever been before,
that she hoped, in spite of her anxiety, and her voice
nightly trembled as she answered-

against this unhappy temper, even when everything is
so smooth and happy, that you cannot imagine why you
need. Sin always gains ascendeney by using pleasure
as his covering. Do not let a single cross word, or
momentary unkind thought, pass unnoticed; never
cease in your petition for grace and strength, but do
not be content with only prAyer:; you must use effort
as well, and if your thoughts will be black, and you feel
as if you could not conquer them by yourself, nor
banish them even by your favourite employments, come

and let us try if we cannot conquer them together. WI]

Caroline could not reply, for eery kind word her
mother spoke seemed to heighten self-reproach, and
make her still more wretched. MRs. Milton felt that
there was no refusal in her silence, and continued talk-
ing to her in that same gentle strain a little while
longer, and then rose to leave her,-but Caroline looked
so sorrowful, that she hesitated.
 No, Flamma; I do not deserve that you should stay

started again to her eyes, for she felt as if it would be
an indescribable comfort still to be alone with her
mother. :1 am too unhappy and too ashamed to join

in the affirmative. I hae of a thing prepared for

you like; but though it will be much more painful to
you to remain idle the remainder of this evening than
to employ yourself, even with the most disagreeable
task, I would much rather you should do so. Once let
temper be quite subdued, and our heart receive
its necessary government, and I have no fear but that
you will very quickly make up for lost time; and even
if you did not, believe me, my dear child, the grace of
the mind, precious as in general they are considered,
and as they are, still are to me actually nothing worth,
if accompanied by a gentle temper and womanly
heart. Do not shrink from the suffering which it will
be to sit alone and think on all that has passed to-lay;
but let your remorse e accompanied by a resolution
(which you are quite capable of not only forming, but of
keeping) not to rest till by prayer and effort you have
sought God's blessing on your difficult task, and so feel
strengthened for its fulfilment; and also for persevering
in it, for you must not hope to succeed in subduing
yourslfall at once. Do this, and I shall be better pleased
than if to-morrow morning you brought me a treble

whose bitter, though salutary pain, Caroline made no
attempt to escape; though, hal it not been for her
mother's advice, she would gladly hae down to her st-

not be so cruel, if she were not well, her spirit was so

M2IIamnilton, more hastily than she was in the

BY HERE's ball took place; and Caroline had so
conquerel herself, that she could listen to Here's flow-
ing account of its delights with actual cheerfulness. It
was so associated with self-reproach, that she could
scarcely think of it without pain; but she was so con-
vinced of her folly in permitting such a very little thing
so to affect her temper as to cause all the misery she had
endured, that she had resolved to punish herself, not
only he listening to Perry, but by herself inquiring the
details. She was a girl of really a strong mind, and
one convinced of error, once released from the fell
dominion of temper, she did not care what pain she en-
dared, or what iiiculty she encountered, so that she
could but convince her mother how truly she regretted,
and tried to atone for past misconduct. It was very
easy, as Is. IIamilton had told her, to begin lost time
in her studies, but not quite so easy to check the cross
word or unkind thought, and to break fro the black
cloud that still at times would envelope her. But she
did not give way, constantly even making opportunities
for self-denial, and duing little kindnesses for Ellen,
though she was too truthful to profess an affection which
as yet she could not feel.

Early in the following week Mr. Ashamed came or
to Oakwood with n petition. which having taken cold
not the party, had been obliged to enact the invalid much
against er inclination, and so entreated her mother ta
invite Caroline to spend a few days with her; and, to
her astonishment, her cold harsh father volunteered to go
himself for her. MIr. IHInmilton at once accepted; his
wife hesitated; but she went at once to Caroline, who
chanced to be reading alone in the schoolroom, for it
was the time of recreation, and told her. For a moment
her countenance was actually radiant with delight, the
next it clouded over.
 You would like it very much, but you are afraid
I shall not permit you to go; is that the meaning of your
change of countenance'' asked her mother, half smiling.
I feel afraid of myself, MAmma; for I fear I am
always more ill-tempered and proud after any such
pleasure as going to Moorlanuds would he.''
Wild you rather not go, then ''
I cannot say quite that, MAmma; I should like it
very much, if I could but be sure of myself after-
wards.''
Did you ever feel such a doubt of yourself before,
Cnroline, when going to stay with Annie?
 No, MAmma; I seem to have thought a great deal
more the last few days, and not to feel half so sure of
myself''
 Then I think there is less danger for you, that is,
of course, if you are willing to risk the temptation of

which make mine so very tame.''

wiser not to go; but if you can resist it, if you think
you can return to your quiet daily routine as forearing

enjoy yourself as much as you can.''
I will try and remember all you said about prayer,
when we think we are most secure, car Mamma,'' and-
cried Caroline, in a very earnest and somewhat lowered
voice. I know, whenever I have hewn to MIoorlands
before, I have felt so clated, so sure I should never be
in an ill temper, so proud from being made so much of,
that I fear i have very often relaxed even in my daily
prayers, and never thought it necessary to prey against
ill-temper. Do you think i I watch myself, and still
pray against it, it will see me from being cross and

gentle on our return, it will do much towards con-
vincing me you are striving in earnest. MIuke haste,
and get ready, and do not forget the poem. I will send
over your things. Tell Lady Helen I shall expect all
her family next MOnday evening, to join Edward's little
farewell-party, and you can return with them,''
WIth the most delighted alacrity Caroline hastened to
get ready, and in her hurry forgot the poem till she
re-entered the schoolroom, which was still untenantel.

thought; `the desks are all put away, and it will detain
me so long to go up again for my hers, and the volume
is too large to carry-oh, I will tear out a blank page

remedy it at Moorlands.''
And she hastily tore out a page from an exercise-book
which lay open on the table; not perceiving that by doing
so a fellow-leaf, which was written on, was loosened,
and fell to the ground, mingling with some torn paper
which had been put in a help to be cleared away. She
had just finished it, when anne came to tell her MIr.
Ashamed could not wait any longer, and asking if all
the papers on the ground were to he removed, Caroline
hastily answered in the affirmative, without looking at
them, and the girl bore them all, in her apron, the
written leaf among them.
Now it so happened that this written leaf had already

pleased with Ellen's careless performance of a French
exercise that morning, that she had desired her to write
it again. It was very difficult, and had materially
softened the time which she had promised to deote to
Edward, who as this week released from is attendance
on MI. Howard, to permit him and Ellen to be as much
together as possible. llurried by him, she left her book
open on the table to dry, and, finding it closed on her
return, put it away, without looking at it. Le following
lay Miss Harbour, of course, requested to see it, and,
to Ellen's utter astonishment, her exercise was not there;
only the fault and blotted theme, with no sign to ex-
plain its disappearance. Now we know MIss HIarcourt
was rather prejudiced against Ellen, and, as she had un-
happily failed in truth more than one--perhaps she
was not so unjust and harsh as poor ellen felt her to
be-she refused to believe her assurance that he had
written it. No one had been in the schoolroom at the
time to whom she could refer ; if Ellen had never dis-
obeyed or received, of course her word would be
sufficient, as her brother's and cousins' would.
That you have failed again, both in obedience and
truth, Ellen, lI cannot for a moment doubt, and it her-
vainly would be my duty to inform your aunt directly;
but as I know it would cause her real suffering to be
compelled to punish you just this last week that Edward
will be with us for some time, I shall say nothing
about it to her, nor inflict any penalty on you to attract
her notice, but it is entirely to her sake forhear. One

tempt. I shall certainly, after this week, warn her not
to trust too implicitly in your artful professions of re-
entrance,''
Poor Ellen felt too bewildered and too miserable even
to try. That she had written her exercise, she was as
positive as that she had been told to do so; but if she
had-what hat become of it? AFresh as Miss IIarcourt
seemed, appearances ere certainly very much against
her. She had not a single proof that she had obeyed,
and her word was nothing; even Emmeline looked at
her doubtingly, and as if she could scarcely even pity
her. It was very little comfort to think her aunt was
not to be told. GIrl own impulse was to go to her, and
tell her at once; but how could she be believed? and
MRs. Milton's words iF I over discover another
untruth, you will compel me to adopt still severer
measures, pain as it will be to myself,'' the remembrance
of all she had suffered, the disappointment it would be
to her aunt, to think all she had said and read to her
were forgotten, when in reality she was constantly think-
ing of and trying to act on them, all checked the im-
pulse, and terrified her into silence.
Miss IIarcourt was not an acute physiognomist; she
could only read in Ellen's face hardihood and reckless-
ness. We rather think MIss. Milton would have read
something very different; but she was very much
engaged with Edward, and if she did think ellen looked
much more out of spirits, she attributed it to natural
feeling at the rapid approach of the day of separation.

least, though every night, that told her another day had
gone, and brought before her all sorts of vague feelings
and fancies of dread, she either cried herself to sleep, or
laid awake, still more unhappy. The suspicion attached
to her seemed to double the severity of the trial of
parting. Ward was her own; Edward must love her,
with all her faults; but even her aunt, her dear, kind,
good aunt, must cease to have any affection for her, if so
constantly believed guilty of a sin so terrible as False-
hood. And she seemed to love her brother still more
than her, every day that brought the hour of parting
nearer-sometimes as if she could not bear the pain of
it being able to Look at his bright face and listen to
his glad laugh and dear voice fr three, perhaps six
long years. IlIer aunt's gentle kindness seemed to in-
crease her unhappiness, for though she knew she was
innocent, still she felt, if MIss IIarcourt hal told MIss.
Milton, she could not be so caressed and cared for,
and she was receiving that which she was believed to hae
forfeited. MIss IIarcourt's face certainly seemed to ask
her as distinctly as words, how she could be so nrtful,
so tdeceitful as to permit her aunt to take such notice
of her; and so she often shrunk away, when she most
longed to sit by and listen to her.
Edward's spirits never sobered, except now and then,
when he thought of leaving Mrs. IIamilton, to whom he
had given the same love he had lavished on his mother,
perhaps to a still greater extent, for reverence was
Largely mingled with it. Mr, TOwards, too, was another
whom he grieved to leave, and MRs. lIamilton so trusted
in these apparently strong affections and his good dis-
position, as to feel but little anxiety; merely sorrow that

she was to lose him for a profession of danger. She did
not know, nor did MIr. TOwards, nor Edward himself, that
he was one who would be guided more by the influence
of those with whom he was intimately thrown, than
by any memory of the absent, or judgment of his
o.
Ellen's manner on the MOnday evening annoyed and
prejudiced Miss Harcourt still more; MRs. Seville and
Mary, Lady Helen and all her family, bringing Caroline
home with them, MIr. Coward, and some of Edward's
favourite companions, all assembled at Lowood, and
every one was determined to be gay and cheerful, and
Edward's voice was the merriest, and his laugh the
happiest there; and Ellen, though her head agree with
the effort and the constant struggle of the preceding
week, was quite cheerful too, and talked to Mary
Seville, and Villa and Cecil Ashamed, and even to MIr.
Howard, is MIss IHarcourt felt she had no right to
go; and as must prove her to be that which she had
always fancied her. MRs. IIamilton, on the contrary,
saw that in the very midst of a laugh or of speaking
her niece's eye would rest on Edward, and the lip quite
quiver, and her smile become for the moment so strained,
that she was satisfied ellen's cheerfulness proceeded
from no want of feeling; she wondered indeed at so
much control at such an elf age, but she loved her
for it notwithstanding. Once only Ellen was nearly

air, of which she was particularly fond, and Edward,
hearing the request, said, eagerly-

She had never in her whole life felt so disinclined to
sing, so as if it were quite impossible; as if she must
cry, if she did; but edward would think it so unkindl
if she refused, for she did not know herself why his
very words should hae increased the difficulty, and
what reason could she give him? MAry went, and asked
Mrs. lIamilton to accompany her; and Ellen did her
very best, but her voice would tremble, and just before
the end of the second verse it failed entirely; but still
she was glad she had tried, for on MIss. IIamilton saying.

could hear, '`I was half afraid you would not succeed
to-night, my dear Ellen; but you were quite right to
try,''-MAry seemed to understand at once why it had
been so difficult for her, to oblige her, and to be quite
sorry she had pressed it so much, and Edward hal
thanked her, and told her he should sing it in idea very
often. She tried to be merry again, but she could not
succeed as before, and so she kept as near her aunt as
she could all the remainder of the evening, as if she
were only safe there.
Ward, too, had a hard battle with himself, as one
by one his favourite companions took leave of im with
henrty shake of the hand, and eager-but in some half-
choked wishes for his health and prosperity; and when
all had gone, and Mr. TOwards, who had remained for
prayers, took him in his arms, and solemnly prayer Go

things that would make him an affectionate guardian to

his organ sister, and repay all the love and care of his
aunt and uncle, it was a desperate effort that prevented
him from sobbing like a child; but he had his kinship-
man's uniform on for the first time, and he was quite
resolved he would not disgrace it; therefore he only
returned MIr. Howar's embrace very warmly, and ran
out of the room. But when his and went into his
room an hour afterwards, it appeared as if he had put
off his pride and his uniform together, for, though he
was fast asleep, his pillow was quite wet with tears.
The next morning was a very sad one, though Percy
and his father did all they could to make it cheerful-
(we ought to have said before that Perry and Ilerhert
were both going with mr. Milton and Edward.) No
one liked the idea of losing ward for so long a time.
DIe had made himself a favourite with all, even with every
one of the servants, who, when the carriage was ready
at eleven o'clock, thronged into the hall to take a
last look at him. He was a altered, that he had that
morning, actually of his own accord, shaken hands with

for all his attention.

so usual visible, and for the moment he seemed so
to love her, that the idea of the sea lost half its delight,

with her. But mercy's joyous voice-

tears, gave Ellen another kiss, and ran into the carriage,
where he was quickly followed by his uncle and cousins,
and in a very few minutes Onkwood, dear, happy Oak-
wood, as his whole heart felt it at that moment, was
hidden from his sight.
Ellen remained by the window looking after the
carriage, long after it was impossible to see or hear it,
very pale, and her eyes very easy, but not in tears; and
as her aunt went to her, and put her arm round her, and
began talking to her very cheerfully of all Edward would
have to write to her about, and how soon they might
hear from him, and that Ellen should answer him as
often and as fully as she liked, and that she would not
even ask to see her letters to him, or all his to her, as
they might have many little affectionate things to say to
each other, that they might not care about any one else

bear it better. Poor like Seaton, of whom you have
heard me speak, has no such comfort; her brother could
not bear the idea of a sea life, and is scarcely strong

I am sure you will acknowledge, if, when the pain of the
present moment has assailed, you think of Alice, and
try to put yourself in her place.''
It is not only parting from Edward,'' answered
Ellen, trying to check her tears, but clasping her arms
still closer round her aunt, as if dreading that her own
words should send her from her.

 Not only parting from Edward, Ellen, love what is
it then? tell me,'' replied MIss. Milton, surprised and
almost alarmed. But Ellen could not go so, much as
she wished it, for her momentary courage had deserted
her, and she could only very more bitterly than before.
 Have you done anything wrong, Ellen? and have
you forgotten my promise?'' inquired her aunt, after
waiting several minutes, and speaking very sorrowfully.
MIss IIarcourt thinks I have, Aunt; but indeed,
indeed I have not; I have not been so very wicked
as to tell another falsehood. I know no one can be-
lieve me, but I would rather you should know it, even if
-if you punish me again.''
 You must try to be more calm, my dear Ellen, and
tell me clearly what is causing you so much additional
suffering; for I cannot quite understand you. I her-
faintly shall not punish you, unless quite convinced you
had failed in truth again, which I do not think you have.
Tell me exactly what it is, and look at me while you are
speaking.''
Ellen tried to obey, but her grief had gained such an
ascendency, that it was very difficult. Mrs. Milton
looked very thoughtful when she ceased, for she really
was more perplexed than she allowed Ellen to perceive;
and the poor child, fancying her silence could only
mean disbelief and condemnation, remained quiet and
trembling by her side.
I promised you that I would not doubt you, Ellen,
and I will not no, though appearances are so strong
against you,'' she said, after several minutes' thought.

``and certainly with great apparent justice; hut she is so
unhappy about it, that I can scarcely believe that she
has forgotten all which passed between us a short time
ago, and I am going therefore, with your permission, to
try if I cannot discover something that may throw a
light on the subject.''
I am afraid that will scarcely be possible,'' replied
Miss IIareourt; ` however, I am glad she has had the
candour to tell you, instead of continuing to receive you
notice as she has done the last week,' Ellen had
brought her book while Miss IInrcourt was speaking,
and Is. IIamilton attentively examined it.
Do you not begin one like this the same day,
Caroline?'
 Yes, MAmma; don't you remember we were obliged
to send to CArries for them? as the parcel with the
stationery did not come from Esther as soon as we ex-
pected. And we noticed how much thinner they were,
though they were the same sized books.''

Do you happen to remember the number of leaves
they contained, and if they were both alike''
t'I know they had both the same number, and I
think it was two and twenty, but I can tell you in a
moment.'' And with her usual quickness of movement
Caroline unlockd her desk, drew forth her book, and
ran over the leaves.
I am right, two and twenty,''
And you are quite sure they had both the same
number ?''
Perfectly certain, Mamma.'
 Then, by some incomprehensible means, two cases
hae vanished from Ellen's-here are only twenty.
Have you ever torn a leaf out, Ellen ?''
No, Aunt, indeed I have not.''
 When lid Miss IHarcourt tell you to write this miss-
ing exercise?''
``Last MlIonday week-I mean yesterday week.''
Where did you write it, and what did you do with
your book afterwards?''
I wrote it at this table, Aunt: I was so sorry I
had to do it, when Edward depended so much on my
gig out with him, that I thought it would save time
not to get my desk; and as soon as it was done, I left
it open to dry. When I came home it was closed, and
I put it away without looking at it, and the next morn-

that Caroline looked as if some sudden light had flashed
upon her, and then, really grieved.
:i am so very, very sorry, Mamma; I do believe it
has been all my haste and carelessness that has caused
Ellen all this unhappiness. I was in such a hurry to
copy the poem for Lady Silent, that I tore a blank leaf
out of an open book on the table, without thinking
whose it was. In my haste the book fell to the ground,
I picked it up to write on it, but never noticed if the
fellow-leaf fell out, which it must have done, and no
doubt Fancy carried it away with some other torn papers,
which she asked me if she were to destroy. I am more
sorry than I can tell you, Ellen; pray believe that I did
not do it purposely,''

knowing the truth,'' said Mrs. Milton, truly replied,
not only from the explanation, but perceiving Cnaroline's

ee No, Madam; there was one like the page out of a
book, which made me ask MIss IIamilton if they were
all to he destroyed. It was such a nice clean piece,
only being written on one side, that I wrapped up some
lace in it-Mrs. Well sing only half an hour before
scolded me for not keeping it more careful,''
 Bring me the sea, my good girl, and Miss Ellen
will give you a still better piece for the purpose,''
replied her mistress, quite unable to suppress a smile,
and Ellen hastily took out a large sheet of writing
paper, and the moment Fnny returned (she seemed
gone an age) gave it to her, and seized her own, which
she placed in her anne's hand, without being able to
speak a single word.
I think that is the very theme, and certain Ellen's
writing, my dear May; i can have no more doubt

the room, delighted with the exchange, and drawing
Ellen close to her, for the poor child could really scarcely
stand.

I really think, ellen, you ought to think Lips for
giving lanny a scolding, as it has done you such excellent
service,'' resumed MRs. l1Milton, playfully; ``and what
feet are you going to give me for taking upon myself ta
prove your innocence in open court? I think myself
so very clever, that I shall tell Percy I am a better
lawyer without study, than he can hope to be with.
You don't seem very capable of doing anything but
kissing me now, and so I will not be very exacting.
You have cried yourself almost ill, and so must bear
the penalty. Go and lie down in my dressing-room
for an hour or two: Emmeliue, go with your cousin,

I come. It is never too early to practise such a complete

Emmeline, quite proud of the charge, and more grieved
than she very well knew how to express, till she was
quite alone with Ellen, that she, too, had suspected and
been cold to her the last week, left the room with her
cousin. Caroline seemed to hesitate a moment, but
she was quite certain by her mother's face that she
wished to speak to 3miss lIarcourt, and so, without being
told, took up her book, and went into the library.

I should have done so myself; but the favour I am
going to ask you, is merely that you will try and never
shoe that yo doubt her word, or refer to her past
failures, I am quite convinced that truthful is not
Ellen's natural disposition, but that it has been caused
by the same circumstances which have made her such
a painfully timid, too humble, character. of with all her
efforts to conquer herself, she still finds her word
laughed, and the past brought forward, she never will
be able to succeed. Examine as strictly and carefully
as you please, and as I am sure she will desire, if
necessary-as she did to-day-but oblige me, and never
donht her. If she finds we never do, it will raise her
self-esteem, and give her a still further incentive to and-
here as strictly to the truth, as she sees we believe she
does. I am certain the habit of falsehood has often
been strengthened by the injudicious and cruel references
to one or two childish failures. If I am never to be
believed, what is the use of trying to tell the truth? is
the very natural question, and the present pain of bare-
fulness being greater than the visible amount of oil,
the habit is confirmed. Will you oblige me ?''
Of course I will, dearest MRs. Milton; how can
you talk sol HAve you not a right to desire what you
think proper, in my guidance of your children, instead
of so appealing to me as an equal'''

'And are you not? My dear They, have I ever in
act or word considered you otherwise? In the very
intrusting my children to your care, do I not prove that
I must think you so? Hae you lived with me all
these years, and not yet discovered that I have same
few notions peculiar perhaps to myself, but that one
amongst them is, that we can never consider too much,
or he too grateful to those invaluable friends who help
us in the training of our children ?''
I have lived long enough with you to know that
there never was, ever can be, any woman like you,
either as wife, mother, mistress, or friend?'' exclaimed
Miss IIarcourt, with most unusual fervour.
 You did not know your own mother, dearest Lady,
as how I wish you had, or you would not think so.
Eery firm, truthful, estimable quality lI may possess,

before she came to me, and some mrs afterwards, I
was more like Ellen than either of my own duarlings;
and that perhaps explains the secret of my love to,
and forbearance with her,''
Like Ellen' repeated Miss Harcourt, much
surprised; `` forgive me, but, indeed, I can scarcely
believe it,'
It is truth, notwithstanding; my poor father's
great preference for Ellen, when we were children,
her very superior beauty and quickness, threw me back
into myself; and I m quite certain if it had not been
for your excellent mother, who came to lie with us
when I was only seven, my character would have suffered
as much from neglect on the one side, and too painful
humility on my own, as ellen's has done. I can

 Hardly-eighteen months is not long enough to
remove the painful impressions and influences of eleven
sorrowful years. Besides, I scarcely know all these
influences; I fear sometimes that she has endured more
than I am aware of. So you must think charitably of
my fancy, dearest Luck,'' she added, smiling, ``and
help me to make Ellen as much like me as a woman,
as I believe she is to me as a child; and to do so, try
and think a little, a very little, more kindly and one-
full of her than you do.''

dearest Mrs. lHanilton; there is no hiding a single

slightly confused, but laughing at the same time.

action, and your determined notice of little things, you
really are a most dangerous person to lie with; and if
you are not more kind, and indulgent, and true
than anybody else, we should all be frightened to come
near you.''
I am glad I have some saving qualities,'' replied
MRs. IIamilton, laughing also; :it would be rather
hard to be isolated because I can read other people's
thoughts. HOwever, we have entered into a compact,''
she continued, rather more seriously; `` you will never
show that you doubt Ellen, and in any difficult matter,
come at once to me,'' and MIss IIarcourt willingly
assented.

The lay passed much more happily than the morn-
ing could hae anticipated. Emmeline's nursing was
ao affectionate and successful, that Ellen was quite able
to join them at dinner, and her aunt had select such
a very interesting story to read aloud, in which one
character was a young sailor, that the hours seemed to
fly; and then they had a long talk about poor Alice
Seaton and her brother, whether it would be possible
for MIr. IIamiIton to place young seaton in some stay-
lion that he lived better, and that his health was more
fitted for. Ellen said, she should like to see and
know Alice so much, for her trial must be such a very
hard one, that her aunt promised her she should in
the MIdsummer holidays, for alice should then come
and spend a week with them. It seemed as if not to be
able to wish Ward good night, and kiss him, brought
back some of the pain again; but she found, that
thinking about poor Alice, and fancying how miserable
she must be, if she loved her aunt as dearly as she did
MRs. IIamilton, to be obliged to part from her as well
as her brother, and live at a school, made her pin
seem less absorbing; as if to help Alice would do more
towards curing it than anything. And though of
course every day, for a little while, she seemed to miss
Edward more and more, still her aunt's affection and her
own efforts, prepared her to see her uncle and cousins
return, and listen to all they could tell her about him
without any increase of pain.

CHAPTER I.
ADVICE D REspECT.
Or readers must imagine that two years and four
months hae elapsed since our last visit to the inmates
of Oakwood. It was the first week in MArch that
Edward Fortescue (only wanting ten days for the cow-
portion of his fourteenth a) quitted a home, which
was happier than any he had ever known, to enter the
world is a sailor; and it is the 7th of June, two
years later, the day on which ellen Fortescue come-
plates her sixteenth year, that we recommend our
natIve.
Her this interval, however, much as we are anxious
to proceed, we must take a brief glance, clearly to
understand the aspect of the Soaked home affairs,
which, from the increasing age of the younger members,
had undergone some slight change. The greatest and
most keenly felt was the departure of Perry and
Herbert for college, the Doctor tclemonth after
Edward had gone: the house seemed actually desolate
without them. Percy's wild jokes and incxshaustible

spirits, and RObert's quiet unobtrusive kindness, much
as they had always been truly appreciate by their home
circle, still scarcely seemed to have been fully felt till the
young men were gone; and the old house actually
seemed cnwappcd in a silence, which it required very
determined effort on the part of all who remained in
the last degree to dispel.
Our rcaders who arc mothers, and earnest ones, will
easily understand the anxious trembling of MRs.
IIamiltan's heart when she parted from her joys for
the world; for such, to spirits fresh, boyish, uusophis-
ticatcd, as they still were, Oxford could not fail to be.
For Ierbert, indeed, she had neither fear nor doubt;-
no sneer, no temptation, no bad example, would affect
him, in whom every passing year seemed to increase and
deepen those exalted feelings which in his earliest
childhood, had less in them of earth than heaven.''
His pity was so real, his faith so fervent, his atlections
so concentrated in his home and in one other kindly-
ual, his love and pursuit of study so ardent and knees-
in, his one aim to become worthy in heart and mind to
serve God as his minister so ever present, that he was of-
actually guardcd even from the world. Percy channel
of those feelings to the same extent, save his ardent love
for home and its inmates-is mother, above all. He
did, indeed, gie even promise that the principles so
carefully instilled had taken firm root, and would guide
his conduct in the world; but hMIrs. lInmilton was too
humble-minded-too convinced-that every human
effort is imperfect, without te sustainiug and vitnlizing
grace of God, to rest in security, as many might have

done, that house she had so worked, so prayed, she
must succeed. She was hopeful, indeed, very hopeful-
how could she be otherwise when she beheld his deep,
though silent, reverence for sacred things-his constant
and increasing respect and before his after-his devoted
affection for herself-his attachment to IIcrbcrt, which
seemed so strangely yet so beautifully to combine almost
reverence for his superior mind and holier spirit, with
the caressing proteetiveness of an elder for a younger-
a stronger for a wake? There was much in all this
to banish anxiety altogether, but not from such a heart
as MRs. IIamilton's; whose very multiplicity of blessings
made her often tremble, and led her to the footstool of
her God, with a piety as humble, as constant, as fervent,
as many believe is the fruit of adversity alone.
Caroline had sufficiently improved as greatly to
decrease solicitude on her account; though there was
still a want of sufficient humility, a too great proneness
to trust implicitly in her own strength, an inclination
to prejudice, and a love of admiration, which all
are MRs. Milton fear would exposed her to some
personal sorrow ere they were entirely overcome. To
produce eternal good, she mightnot murmur at tcmporal
suffering; but her fond heart, though it could anticipate
it calmly for herself, so shrunk from it, as touching her
child, that the nearer approached the period of
Caroline's introduction to the gay world, the more
painfully anxious she became, and the more gladly
would she have retained her in the retirement of
Oakwood, where all her better and higher qualities

loveable when its basis was the Real,-that she was
neither romantic nor visionary. been as her sense-
politics were, even her a word of fiction, they
prompted the deed and act of kindness, not the ten
alone. For miles round her father's large domins she
was known, loved, so felt as a guardian spirit, that the
very soul of her step seemed to promise joy. She
actually seemed to lie to others-making their
pleasures hers; and, withal, so joyous, especially in her
own home and ant Greville MInor, that even anxiety
seemed exorcised when she was once. Before strangers,
indeed, she would be shy as a young fawn; though
even then natural kindliness of heart prompted such
kindness of word and maker, as always to excite the
wish to see her again.

had been away, had only once occasioned anxiety.

in the highest terms of n certain Liberty IInrdiag, one
of the senior midslipen of his ship, for whom he
had received kindness upon kindness; and who, being
six or seven years older than himself, he jestingly wrote
to his aunt and uncle, must certainly be the very best
friend he could have chosen, as he was much too old to
lead him into mischief. Why he (Harding) had taken
such a fancy to him, Edward could not tell; but he was
so excessiely kind, so taught him his duty, and
smooth all the difficulties and disagreeable which,
he owned, had at first seemed overwhelming, that he
never could be grateful enough. He added, that,
though not a general favourite with his immediate
messages, he was very lightly esteemed by Sir Edward
Only and his other superior officers, and that the
former had much commanded him for his kindness to
the youngest boy on board, which Edward was. It
was very easy to perceive that young Fortescue's
susceptible afficctions had all been not only attracted, but
already riveted by this new friend. All the young
party at Lowood rejoiced at it; Mrs. Milton would
have done so, also, had she not perceived an anxious
expression on her husband's face which alarmed her.
He did not, however, make any remark till he had
spoken to MIr. Towards, send then imparted to is with
alone, (not choosing to create suspicion in the open
hearts of his children,) that this Liberty IIrdiug,
though very young at the time, had been one of the
principal actors in the affair which had caused Mr.
FOrward to dismiss his pupils, as we related in a former

hardihood, so marked natural depravity, that MIr,
Towards had had less hope for him than for any of the
others. This opinion had even borne out by his after
conduct at home; but that the affair had been such-
carefully hushed up by his family, and by immense
interest he had been permitted to enter the nay, where,
it was said, his youthful errors had been so redecmed,
and his courage and conduct altogether and so won him

lion was naturally bad, and doubted the interval response
to the seeming outward good and he was grieved and
anxious beyond measure, when he heard that he was
not only on or the same slip as rEward, but already

anxiety, of course, extended itself to Mr. and MRs,
IIamuilton to such a degree, that at the first moment
they would gladly hare endeavoured to exchange his
ship; but this would have seemed very strange to it
Edward Manly, who was one of Mr. IInmilton's most
valued friends. DIe had, in fact, actually learned
Edward's becoming a milshipman till Sir cLearly could
take him in his own ship, and naw to place him
elsewhere was really impossible; and, after all, though
he might be removed from1 REading's influence, how could

painful as it was to throw a doubt and shade over such
youthful confidence and affection, implored him not to
trust too implicitly in IIarding; that his character had
not always been free from stain; that he (Ward) was
still so young and so susceptible he might find that he
had climbed principles, and been tempted to wrong almost
unconsciously, and suffer from its effects when too late
to escape. hey wrote as affectionately and indulgeutly
as they could,-Mr. FOrward, as well as his aunt and
uncle; but sill they felt that it certainly did appear
cruel to warn a young war heart to break off the first
friendship it ha4 formed; especially as he beheld that
friend approved of b his Captain, and looked up to
by the crew. And that Edward's reply was somewhat
cold, though he did promise caution, and assure them
he had not so forgotten the influences and principles of
Oakwood as to allow any one to lead him into error, did
not surprise them. He never referred to Harding
again, except sometimes casually to mention his come-
panionship, or some act which had on him approval;
and they really hoped their letters had had at least
the effect of putting him on his guard. Sir Edward
Manly's own reply to MIr. HIamilton's anxious appeal
to him, however, succeeded in quitting their fears: he
assured them he had seen nothing in IIarding's
conduct, since he had been at sea, to render him an
unfit companion for any of; that he had earl of some
boyish faults, but it was rather hard he was to suffer
from them as a man; and he assured his friends that
he would keep a strict look out after young Fortcscuc,

which, young as he was, he could not help loving,
should be inquired into, and the friendship ended by
sending IInrtiug to some other ship. So wrote Sir
World MIngle, with the fullest possible intention to
perform; nd edward's anxious friends were happy,
more especially as letter after letter brought praises of
tlc young sailor for captain, oflicers, and crew, and
his own epistles, though brief, were affectionate and
satisfactory.
It was happy for Mr. and MRs. Milton, an Mr.
TOwards, too, that they were ignorant of the multiplicity
of great and little things which could not fail to cross
the mind of Sir Edward FAmily, who was not only
Captain of the Prince WIlliam, a gullont sevsenty-four,
but commandcr of the little flotilla which accompanied
hi, or they could not have rested so secure. HAppy

they were not perfectly acquainted with 1ward's real
weakness of character, or of the fearful extent of
mischief which the influences of his first twelve years
had engendered. MInd he remained ant Oakwoot till
nineteen or twenty, it is probable they would here been
insensibly conquered, and the impressions of good, which
he had appeared so readily to receive, really taken root
and guided his after life, but eighteen months could not
do this,-is MIss. IIamilton would have felt, had she
known all the effect of her sister's ill-judged partiality
and indulgence ; but this, as we have already mentioned,
was concealed from her by the bright, lovenble, winning
qualities, which alone were upperost. Our readers, in
fact, know more of Edward (if they have at all thought

suffer for him) than his ant, penetrative as she was;
and, therefore, in the events we shall hae occasion to

successfully obserant, should fail in penetration when

Edward's life ate Oakwood had been so very happy,
its pleasures and indulgence so innocent, so numerous,
that he did not himself know his liability to temptation,
from the expressive love of pleasure which his mother's
indisereet indulgence had originally infused. In con-
trod which his uncle and MIr. TOwards exercised over
him, had been so very gentle and forbearig, that he
had scarcely ever felt the inclination to exert self-will,
and when it so chanced that he had, Ellen had covered
is fault, or borne its penalty for him. DIe thought he
had guide himself, when in fact he was guided; but
this could no longer be the case when one of the little
world which thronged a first-rate man-of-ar. Outward
actions were, indeed, under control ; but what captain,
the most earnest, most able in the world, could look
into and guide the hearts of all those committed to his
care? And almost the first action of Edward's unbiassed
will was indignantly to tear into shreds, and scatter t6
the winds and waves, those affectionate and warning
letters, and cling the closer to, rest the more con-
finding on, IIarding, for the wrong that he thought he
had done him, by allowing his eye even to rest for a
moment on such base unfounded aspcrsions on his
name.

SOME INFLUENCE.
When MRs. IIamilton told Ellen that her letters to
her brother, and his to her, should never be subjected
to any scrutiny hut their own, she acted on a principle
which many parents and guarlians would consider as
high-flown and romantic, and which she herself had
most painful reason to regret-the effects, nt least, but
not the principle itself, for that was back on too refined
n feeling to waver, even though she suffered from it.
She could not bear, nor could her husband, the system
which prevailed in some families of their acquaintance,
that their children could neither receive nor write letters
to each other, or their intimate friends, without being
shown to their serious. As for opening and reading a
letter directed to one of them, before its possessor saw
it, as they had seen done, it was, in their cstimation, as
much dishonour and as mean, as if such a thing had
been done to an adult. Perfect confidence in their
home they had indeed distilled, and that confidence
was never withheld. there was a degree of suspicion
attached to a demand always to see what a child had
written or received, from which Mrs. IInmilton's
pure mind actually shrunk in loathing. In the many
months the Grandam family passed in lOndon, Annie
and Caroline corresponded without the least restraint:
no doubt many would pronounce Mrs. lIamilton very
unwise, knowing Annie so well, and trembling for
Cnroline as she did; but as she told MIss lIarcourt,
she had some notions peculiar to herself (they always
had the sanction and sympathy of her husband, low-
her), and this was one of them. She was always
pleased and interested in all that er children read to

13
her, either from their own epistles or those they re-
lived, and if they wished it, read them herself, but she
never asked to do so, and the consequence was, that
the most perfect confidence was given.
When Ellen and Edward parted, they were both so
young, that MIr. Ilamilton had hesitated as to whether
his wife was quite justified in the perfect trust with
which she treated them, and whether it would not be
wiser to overlook their correspondence; but MIss.
IInmilton so argued that their very youth was their
safeguard, that they were all in all to each other, and
as such she wished them to feel they were bound by
even a closer and fonder tie than that of brother and
sister under other circumstances, so on over her
husband, that he yielded; and from the long extracts
that Ellen would read of Edward's letters to the family
in general, and of her own to her aunt, he was quite
satisfied as to the wisdom of his wife's judgment.
For full a year after Edward's departure, eLlen's
conduct and general improvement had given her aunt
nothing but pleasure; even Miss Harcourt's and Care-
line's prejudice was nearly removed, though, at times,
the fancy would steal over both that she was not exactly
what she seemed, and that that which was hidden
was not exactly that which IS. IIamilton believed it;
and this fancy strengthened by a certain indefinable
yet felt change in Ellen, commencing about thirteen
months after she had parted from her brother. Mrs.

but at length she could no longer conceal from herself

times ghost shrinking, and sad, as in her childhood.
The openness, and almost light-heartedness, which for
one brief year had so characterized her, seemed come-
lately but so insensibly to have gone, that MIss. IlIamilton
could not satisfy herself as to the time of the commence-
mcnt, or reason of the change. PIer temper, too, became
fitful, and altogether, her aunt's anxiety and bewildered-
ment as to her real character returned in full force.
One, when gently questionuel as to why her temper
was so altered, ellen confessed, with tears, that she
knew it was, but she could not help it, she believed she
was not well ; and Mrs. IIamilton called in MIr. Mnitland,
who said that shereally as in a highly nervous state,
and required care and quickness, and the less notice that
was taken of her momentary irritability ar depression

his young patient blessed him for those words; giving
n reason for and so allowing the trepitation which paled
her cheek, parched her lips, and made her hand so
tremble, when she received a letter from her brother,
to pass unnoticed.
bUt change in manner was not all; almost every
second or third month Ellen's allowance of pocket-
money (which was unusually liberal, was MRs. lInmilton
wished to accustomed her girls, from an early age, to
purchase some few articles of dress for themselves, and
so learn the value of money) most strangely and must-
riously disappeared. Ellen either could not or would
not give any account of it; and, of course, it not only
exposed her to her aunt's most serious displeasure, but

15
bewilderment and anxiety, but MIss IIarcourt's and
Caroline's unspoken prejudice. fRom the time of
Ward's departure, Ellen had never been discovered in
or suspected of either uttering or acting an untruth;
but her silence, her apparent determined ignorance of,
or resolution not to confess the cause of the income-
prelensible disappearance of her allowance, naturally
compelled MRs. IIamilton to rupert to the propensity of
her childhood, and fear that trutbfuluess was again
deserting her. PIer displeasure lasting, of course, the
longer, from Ellen's want of openness, and the air of
what almost appeared to he anxious yet still affectionate
aunt like sullen defiance (in reality, it was almost
despair), when spoken to, caused a painful degree of
estrangement between them, always, however, going
place to MRs. IIamilton's usual caressing amber, the
moment Ellen seemed really repentant, and her month's
expenditure could be properly explained.
For six or eight months before the day on which we
recommend our narrative, there had been, however,
nothing to complain of in Ellen, except still that un-
natural reserve and frequent depression, as if dreading
something she knew not what, which, as every other
part of her conduct was satisfactory, MRs, Milton tried
to comfort herself was physical alone. No reference to
the past was ever made: her manner to her niece came
the same as usual; but she could not feel secure as to
her character, and, what was most painful, there were
times when she was compelled to doubt even lleu's
affection for herself, a thing she had never had the
16

slightest cause to do even when she was a little inaniate
child.
But very few changes had taken place in the Groeville
and Ashamed families. MRs. Seville'a trial continued
in unmitigated, if not hcightened, bitterness: the ex-
ample, the companionship of his father had appeared to
have bhlighted very good see while she had strenuouasly
endeavoured to plant in the bosom of her son. At six-
then he was already an accomplished man of the world,
in its most painful sense: he had his own companions,
his own haunts; scarcely ever visiting his home, for a
reason which, could his poor mother have known it,
would have given her some slight gleam of comfort.
DIe could not associate either with her or his sister,

To decide this nacknowledged remorse, his manner

increase of grief.

MIar-who, she knew, without her love and constant
cheerfulness, must sink beneath such a constant aggra-
hated trial. Yet that very low brought increase of
anxiety from more than one cause. As yet there was
no change in their manner of living, but MIss. Grerille
knew that, from the excesses of her husband and son,
there very soon must be. Ruin, poverty, all its fearful
ills, stood before her in perspective, and how could
MAry's fragile frame and gentle spirit bear up against
 them? Again and again the question pressed upon her-
Di Herbert Milton indeed love her child, as every
passing year seemed to confirm? and he did, could-
could his parents consent to his union with the child of
such a father, the sister of such a brother? There were
always long messages to MAry in Herbert's letters to
his mother, which Mrs. Milton not one delivered
herself, but sometimes even put the whole letter in
Mary's hand, and at last willingly said, she really
thought they had much better write to each other, as
then she should chance to get a letter all to herself, not
merely be te medium of a communication between
them; and MAry, though she did slightly blush, which
she was in the habit of doing for scarcely anything,
seemed to think it so perfectly natural, that she merely
said if Herbert had time to write to her, she should
like it very much, and she would certainly answer
him.
 MY dear Emmeline, what are you about?'' was
Mrs. Reilly's anxious appeal, the moment they were
alone.

: Giving pleasure to two young folks, of whom I am
most exeessively fond,'' was Mrs. IIamilton's laughing
reply. `Don't look so terrified, my dear Essie. They
love each other as boy and girl now, and if the love
should deepen into that of man and woman, why, all I
can say is-I would rather have your MAry for my
Herbert than any one else I know.''
She is not only my Mary?'' answered the poor
mother, with such quivering of the eye and lip, that
it checked MRs. Milton's joyousness at once.
 She is your NIary, in all that can make such a
character as my Herbert happy,'' was her instant reply,
with a pressure of MRs. Greville's hand, that said far
more than her words. I am not one of those, who
like to make matchcs in anticipation, for man' s best laid
schemes are so often overtlrown by the most trifling
hut unforeseen chances, that display a much wiser pro-
violence than our greatest wisdom, that I should con-
side it almost siuful so to do; but never let a thought
of suffering cross your mind, dearest Essie, as to what
my husband's and my own answer will be, if our
Herbert should indeed ever wish to choose your Mary as
his wife, and, certainly a most important addition,
should she wish it too. Our best plan now is to let them
follow their own inclinations regarding correspondence.
We can, i am sure, trust them both, for what can be a
greater proof of my boy's perfect confidence in my sum-
path with lis feelings towards her, than to make me

will continue to do, even if he write. I have not the
smallest doubt, that he will inclose me his letters to

er unsteady, and I rather think, your Money will send
me her replies in the same unresered manner,''
And she was right. Nor, we think, did the purity
and innocence of those letters, so intensely interesting
to each other, give place to any other style, even when
they chanced to discover that MIss. HIamilton was utterly
ignorant of their contents, except that which they chose
to read or impart to her themselves.
But even this assurance on the part of one so loved
and trusted as Mrs, IIamilton, could not entirely remove
MRs. Greville's ague anticipations of evil. MIr. Greville
always shunned, and declared he hotel, the Milton
family; but as he seemed to entertain the same feeling
towards herself and her poor Mary, she tried to comfort
herself by the idea that he would never trouble his
head about his daughter, or be glad to get her out of
his way, especially if she married well. Still anxiety
for the future would press upon her; only calmed by
her firm unchanging faith in that gracious ever-watchful
Providence, who, if in spite of her heavy troubles she
still tried to trust and serve, would order all things for
the rest; and it was this, this faith alone, which so
supported her, as to permit her to make her child'n
home and heart almost as happy as if her path had all
been smooth.

quite delighted, but his mother was so indignant, that
she overcame her habitual awe of her husband, sufli-
society to vow that she would not live so far from her
son, and if he must go to school, she mustlenve MOor-
lands. Ashamed, with equal positiveness, declared that
he would not give up a home endeared to him so long,
nor so entirely break off his companionship with his
denrest friends. A very stormy dialogue of course took
place, nd ended by both parties being more resolved to
entertain their own opinion. The interposition of MIr.
and MRs. IInmilton, however, obtained some concession
on Grandam's part, and he promised that, if Lady lIttle
would make Moorlands her home from the middle of
July till the end of October, November and DDecember
should be spent in the vicinity of Eton, and she should
then have six months for London and its attraetions.
This concession brought back all Indy Helen's smiles,
and charmed Annie, though it was a source of real
regret to Cnroline, who could not help feeling a little
pained at her friend's small concern at this long sarah-
lion from her, but still she loved her; and, as Anne
wrote frequently, and when she was at Mloorlnnds never
tired of her society, (the night months of absence going
er so much interesting matter to impart,) Caroline was
not only satisfied, but insensible to the utter want of
sympathy which Annie manifested in her pursuits, her
pleasures. MRs. Milton often wished that Curoline
had chosen one more descrving of her friendship, but
she trusted that time and experience would teach her
Annie's real character, and so did not feel any anxiety
on that score.
ICE 1SILENCE.
21
There was only one member in Grandam's family,
that MIr. and MRs, Milton hoped might bring joy and
comfort to their friend, and that was his little Villa.
She was five years younger than Annie, and being much
less attractive, seemed almost forgotten, and so was
spared the dangerous ordeal of flattery and indulgence
to which Annie had been subject; and from being more
violent and less agreeable than Cecil, was not so fre-
quietly spoiled by her mother. They feared the poor
child would have much to endure from her own temper,
Annie's overbearing insolence, and Lady ELlen's cut-
table indolence; but Mrs. Milton hoped when she
resided part of the year in London, as she felt she would
very soon be called on to do, to be opened to rouse
Grandam's attention towards his youngest child, and
prevail on him to relax in his sternness towards her;
and by taking notice of her continually herself, instil
such feelings in her, as would attract her towards her
father, and so increase the happiness of both. Eery
visit of the Grandam family to MIoorlands, she resolved
to study Villa well, and try all she could to make one in
reality so estimable, as her husband's friend, happy, in
one child at least.

MIrth for the season, when, as she would be eighteen and
a half, she should be fully introduced. Caroline of course
anticipated this period with the most intense delight.
She was quite satisfied that in her first visit she should
study as much as, if not more than, before; and content
and thankful that her mother would allow her to enter
so far into society, as always to join dinner or evening
parties at home, and go to some of her most intimate
friends, when their coteries were very small and friendly,
and another eagerly anticipated delight, sometimes go
to the opera and the best concerts, and visit all the
galleries of art.
1o poor Emmeline these anticipations gave no pleasure
whatever; she hated the very thought of leaving Oak-
wood, firmly convinced that not the most highly intel-
actual, nor the most delightful social enjoyment in
London, could equal the pure delights of Devonslire
and home. Ellen seemed too engrossed with her own
thoughts to evince a feeling either way, much to her
aunt's regret, as her constant quietness and seeming
determined reprcssion of her sentiments, rendered er
character still ore difficult to read.
But a head disappointment was preparing for Care-

regard of the reigning sovereign, Christian VII, that on
his departure, the royal wish was expressed for his
speedy return. On his voyage home, he was wrecked
off the Fire Islands, and rescued from danger and
death by the strenuous exertions of the islanders, who
entertained him and the crew with the utmost looks-
reality, till their slip was again sea-worthy. During his
involuntary detention, MIr. IHIamilton become deeply inter-
 nested in the Heroes, a people lying, it seemed, in the
midst of desolation, a cluster of small rocky islets,
divided by she hundred miles of stormy sea from their
fellows. He made the hour of the islands, and found
almost all their inhabitants possessing the same church-
teristics as those of Shame, the island of which he had
been wrecked; kind, hospitable, honest, temperate,
inclined to natural piety, but so perfectly indifferent to
the various prisations and annoyance of their lot, as to
make no effort towards remoing them.  Travelling either
by And or sea was so dangerous and difficult, that in
some parishes, the clergyman could only perform service

desire took possession of him, to do some real service
for those wo lad saved him from danger and treated

were left undisturbed, they were very easily led, and this
discovery strengthened his purpose. Ilis departure was
universally regretted; an his promise to return ma-
gained too great a privilege to be believed.
As soon as his political duties in England permitted,
MIr. IInmilton revisited Denmnrk, and was received
with such cordiality as to encourage him to make his
petition for the improvement of his Majesty's poor
subjects of Shame. It was granted directly; the little
island so far made over to him, that he was at liberty
to introduce and erect whatever he pleased within it;
and Mr. IIamilton, all eagerness for the perfection of
his plans, returned with speed to England; obtained
the valuable aid of a poor though worthy clergyman,
who, with his wife, voluntarily offered to make Samuboe

effect of his schemes. MIr, and Mrs. Newson were per-
gently happy. heir son was united to the pretty and
excellent daughter of one of the Vanish clergymen,
and a young family was blooming round them, so that
there seemed a fair promise of the ministry of Smoke
continuing long in charge of the same family.
MIr. Milton, on his deathbed, exacted a promise
from his son that he would not permit the island to fall
 back into its old habits; but that, if required, he would
visit it himself. The visit was not required, but Percy
Ambition, (the father of the present possessor of
Onkwood,) from respect to his father's memory, made a
voyage to Shame on the demise of the elder Newson.

still entertained in that distant island for his father.
The same promise was demanded by him from his son,
and Arthur IIamilton had visited Here directly after
the loss of his parent, and before his engagement with

CHAPTER II.
A LETTER, AND ITS CONSEQUENCES.

I was the seventh of June, and one of those glorious
mornings, when Nature looks lovelier than her. The
windows of the breakfast-room were thrown widely
open, and never did the superb trees of Oakwood Park
look richer or display a greater variety of green. The
lower-garden, on part of which the breakfast-room
opened, was actually dazzling with its profusion of
brilliant flowers, on which the sun looked down so
gloriously; a smooth lawn whose green was a perfect
emerald, stretched down from the partners till it was lost
in woody openings, which disclosed the winding river,
that, lying as a lake on one side, appeared to sweep
round some exquisite scenery on the opposite side, and
form another lake, about a mile further. It was
Declined's favourite view, and she always declared, that
it so varied its aspects of loveliness, she was sure, it
never looked two mornings exactly alike, and so long
would she stand and admire, that her mother often
threatened to send her, her breakfast in her own room,
where the view, though picturesque, would not so come-
lately turn her attention from the dull realities of life.

There were some letters on the table this morning, so
she had a longer time to drink in poetry than usual.
 WHo can offer Ellen a more precious birthday-gift
than mine?'' exclaimed Mrs. IIamilton, playfully hold-
ing up a letter, as her niecc entered. I wonder, if
Edward remembered how near his sister was to fifteen,
and so wrote on the chance of your receiving it on the
ay itself.''
 Way, Ellen, what a queer effect pleasure has on
you I always notice, you turn quite pale, whenever
Ward's letters arc given to you,'' interposed Decline,
looking at her cousin, and laughing.`I am sure, the
very hurry I am in to open Perry's and HErbert's,
must give me a colour, and you are as deliberate as if
you did not care about it. I to wish you would not be

but I am not too late, I hope, to say, God bless you, and
wish that every year may pass more happily, more use-
fully, and more prepared for Eternity than the last.'
I do not think you have forgotten it, my dear
Uncle,'' replied Ellen, gratefully, (she had not yet opened
her brother's letter:) `` for my Aunt says, I am to thank
you as well as her for this beautiful birthday-gift,'' and
she displayed an elegant little gold watch; ' indeed, I
do not know how to thank you for all your kindness !''
she added so earnestly, that tears came to her eyes.

not going to lecture you on your birthday, and with a
letter from Edward in your hand,'' he continued, smiling.
' Open it, my dear, I want to know its date; I rather
think, my friend MAnly's must be written later.''
Nothing in it for me, Ellen ?'' asked her aunt.

' An enclosure for you, Ellen; way, that is as queer
as your paleness l'' said Emmeline.
Do let your cousin's paleness alone,'' interposed
MRs. IIamilton, gaily. I really cannot perceive she
has any less colour than usual, and as for the enclosure,
Edward often has something to and at the last moment,
and no room to insert it, and so there is nothing remark-
able in his using another half sheet.''
Emmeline always created wonders out of shadows,''
said Caroline, dryly.
'And you never see anything but dull, coarse, heavy
realities,'' laughed her sister, in reply.  Come, ellen,
tell us something of this idle brother of yours, who
promised to write to me every packet, and never
does,''
Ellen read nearly the whole letter aloud, and it was
unusually entertaining, for the ship had been rushing
about the last mont, and Earl described the various
scenes and new places he had visited more lengthily
than usual. He anticipated with great glee an eager-
ment with some desperate pirates, whose track they
were pursuing.

Nor is it; Sir Edward seed, directed, and put it
up for him in his own to me. Thy had piped all hands,
as he calls it, because the pirate ship was in sight, and
an engagement did take place.''
 And Ward-oh Uncle, is he hurt? I am sure, he
is, by your face,'' exclaimed Ellen, trembling, and all
the little circle looked alarmed.
 Then my face is a decciver,'' replied MIr. IIamilton,
quite cheerfully. DIe only received a slight flesh
wound in his right arm, which prevented his using it to
complete is letter, and I rather think, he would have
willingly been hurt still more, to receive such praises
as Sir Edward lavishes on him. Listen to what he says-
Not boy or man on board distinguished itself more
than your nephew: in fact, I am only astonished le
escaped as he did, for those pirates are desperate fighter,
and when we boarded them, rescue was in the midst
of them, fighting like a young lion. Courage and
gallantry are such dazzling qualities in a young lady,
that we think more of the perhaps than we ought,
but I cannot say too much for your nephew; I have
not a lad more devoted to his duty. I was glad to
show him my approbation by giving him some days'
liberty, when we were off New York; but I have since
told him, the air of land certainly did not agree with
him, for he has looked paler and thinner her since.

occasion to send another prize sooner home, I think
it not improbable I shall nominate him as one of the
officers, that he may have the benefit of the healthful
be-yes of Old England, to bring back lis full strength.'
There, Ellen, I think that is a still better birthday-
present than even Edward's own letter. I am as proud
of my nephew as Sir Edward is.''
And do you think, he really will come?'' asked
Ellen, trying to conquer her emotion,
 We will hope it, dearest,'' replied her aunt, kindly.
 But do not think too much about it, even if Sin
Edward be not able to do as he says. IIi own slip
will be coming home in a year or two, and you owned
to me yourself this morning, it did not seem as long as
it really is, since our dear sailor left us; so the remain-
ing time will soon pass. Finish your breakfast, and to,
love, and enjoy his letter again to yourself.''
And Ellen gladly obeyed; for it was from no imagine-
ary cause, that the receipt of Edward's letters so often
paled her cheek, and parched her lip with terror. She
knew that, concerning him, which none else but Harding
did; and even when those letters parted nothing but
that which she could read to her family, the dread was
quite enough to banish panting like the elastic happy-
ness, natural to her age, and called for by the kindness
of those she loved. His letter this time, however, had
not a word to call for that sickness of the heart, with
which she had received it, and she read it again and
again; with a thankfulness, too intense for words,

its meaning, for the fearful lesson of quiet unconccrn
when the heart is bursting, had been too early learned.

wild snatch of an old ballad about sailors.
Ellen shut the door, secured it, and with a lip and
cheek colourless as her robe, an eye strained and blood-
slow, read the following words-few indeed.

For one long hour Ellen never moved. Her brain
felt scorched, her limbs utterly powerless. Every word
seemed to write itself in letters of fire on her heart and
brain, till she could almost hae screamed, from the
dread agony; and then came the heavy weight, so often
felt before, but never crushing every thought and
energy as now, the seeming utter impossibility to come-
ply with that fearfully urged demand. He called it a
sum so trifling, and she felt a hundred, ay a thousand
pounds were not more difficult to obtain. She had said
indeed, denying herself every little indulgence, every
personal gratificatiou, spending only what she was
obliged, and yet compelled to let her aunt believe, she
had properly expendled all, that she might have the
means of sending him money when he demanded it,
without exsposing herself to doubt and displeasure as
before; but in the eight months since his last cell, she
had only been enabled to put by fifteen pounds, not
half the sum he needed. Ho was she to get the rest
and she had so buoyed herself with the fond hope, that
even if he did write for help again, she could send it to
him so easily-and now-her mind seemed actually to
reel beneath the intense agony of these desperate words.

been terrible, almost awful in one so young-though a
brief interval would have sufficiently calmed both the
hearer and the speaker, to satisfy, that they were but
words, and that self-destruction is never breathed, if
really intended-but written, the writer at a distance,
imagination at liberty, to heighten every terror, very
reality, their reader a young loving girl, utterly ignorant
of the world's ways and temptations, and the many
errors to which youth is subject, but from which man-
hood may spring up unsulliedl; and so believing,
almost crushed by the belief, that her brother, the only
one, her own, respected, beloved, as he was said to be,
had yet committed such faults, as would hut him from
his present position to the lowest depth of degradation,
for what else could tempt him, to swear not to survive
it? Was it marvel, that poor Ellen was only conscious
that she must see him?-Again did her dying mother
stand before her-again did her well-remembered voice

the deep recesses of the windows: her work in her lap,

on the beautiful scenery of the park, but not seeing a

stood by her.  You need not start so guiltily and look
so very terrified, but confess that you are thinking

Ellen made a desperate effort, conquered her tears,
and tried to converse cheerfully. It was absolute agony
to hear EDward's name, but she served herself to do so,
to acknowledge she was thinking of him, and that it
was very silly to worry about such a slight wound: and

Edward disgraced, cxpcllel, and seeking death by his
own hand. There was only one plan that seemed in the
last feasible, and that was to send to him, or sell her-
self the watch she had received on her birthday, and if
that was not enough, some few trinkets, which had been
her mother's, and which the last six months her aunt
had given into her own care. She ventured casually to
inquire if there were any opportunity of sending a par-
cell to Edward, but the answer was in the negative, and
increased her difficulty. The only person she dared even
to think of so far intrusting with her deep distress and
anxiety for money, but not its cause, was widow LAng-
ford, the mother of Robert, (the young gentleman's
attendant, whom we had occasion more than once
to mention, and the former nurse of all MIr. and Mrs.
IIamilton's children. She occupied a cottage on the out-
skirts of the park, an was not only a faroritc with all the
young party, Ellen included, for she generally come to
use her in her many illnesses,) but was regarded with
the greatest confidence and affection by MIr. and MRs.

her unwavering fidelity and active service, by taking her
only child robert into their family when only seven;
placing him under the immediate charge of Morris, the
steward, and of course living in the same house, of his
other also; and when fifteen, making him personal at-

little confidential services for his master at Lowood.
To widow afford, Ellen tried to resolve that she
would apply, but her fearful state of mental agony had
not marked the lapse of time, or had caused her to for-
get that her letter must be read in a week. The party
were all going a delightful excursion, and to drink tea
at Grerille MInor, so that she would not be home till
quite late; but in the morning, Ellen, though she had
dressed for going out, appeared to ave eery some-
tom of such a violent headache, that her aunt advised
her remaining quietly at home, and she assented with
eagerness, refusing every offer of companionship, saying
if the pain went off, she could quite amuse herself, and
if it continued, tquietness and Lewis's nursinug ere the
best things for her.
 But give me your letter before we go out, Ellen, I
am only waiting for it, to close mine to it Edward.-
Why, my dear, have you forgotten I told you it must be

animation that she had not finished it.  It must be
done and sent to T. before four to-day, so i do hope you
end ill allow you to write, for Edward will be woefully
disappointed if there be not a line from you, especially
as from his ship rushing about, it may be several weeks

party disersing at the moment, her silence was in-
noticed. MIr. IIamilton gave her his letter, and in half
an hour afterwards she was alone. She sat for nearly
an hour in her own room, with her desk before her, her
face buried in her hands, and her whole frame shaking
as with an ague.
It must be,'' she said at length, and unlocking a
drawer, tool thence a small cross and one or two other
trinkets, put them up, and taking off' her watch, looked
at it with such an expression of suffering, that it seemed
as if she could not go on, carefully folded it up with the
other trinkets, and murmuring, ``if nurse ILangford will
but take these, and lend me the twenty pounds till she
can dispose of them, I may save him yet,-and if she
betray me-if she tell my aunt afterwards, at least only
I shall suffer; they will not suspect him. But oh-to
lose-to be doubted, hated, which I must be at last.
Oh MOther MIotlerI Why may I not tell aunt: she
would not disgrace her.'' And again she crouched
down, cowed by that fearful struggle to the very earth.
After a few minutes, it passed, and deliberately putting
on her bonnet and shawl, she took up her trinkets, and
set off to the widow's cottage, her limbs so trembling,
that she knew not how she should accomplisl even that
short walk.
The wind was unusually high, although the day was
otherwise lovely, and she was scarcely able to stand

and, in fact, the younger members were prolibited from

ment entered Ellen's mind. She felt so exhausted by the
wind blowing the branches and leaves noisily nd con-
fully around, that on reaching a sort of grassy glade,
more open than her previous path, she sat down a
minute on a mossy stone. The wind blew some
withered sticks and leaves towards her, and, amongst
them, two or three soiled pieces of thin paper, stained
with damp, one of which she raised mechanically, and
started up with a wild cry, and seized the others almost
unconsciously. She pressed her hands over her eyes,
and her lips moved in the utterance of thanksgiving.

she heard them; and she retraced her steps, so swift
-so gladly, the very pain nd exhaustion were unfelt.
She rote for half an hour intently-eagerly; though
that which she wrote she knew not herself, and never
could recall. She took from the secret drawer of her
desk, (that secret drawer which when Perry had so
laughingly showed her the secret of its spring, telling
her nobody but himself knew it, she little thought she
should have occasion so to use,) some bank-notes,
of two, three, and five pounds each, making the
fifteen she had so carefully loarded, and placed
with them the two she had found. As she did so

hour MIr. IIamilton had named. It was gone; and she
sat down to breathe. Some impulse, never experienced
before, urged her, instead of destroying Edward's des-
perate letter, as she had one similar appeals, to retain
it in a blank envelope in that same secret drawer. As
she tried to rouse herself from a sort of stupor which
was strangely creeping over her, her eye caught the
fie pound note which she had not had occasion to use,
and a thought of such overwhelming wretchedness
rushes upon her, as effectually, for the moment, to
disperse thntstupor, and prostrate her in an agony of
supplication before her God.

HOw long that withering agony lasted, Ellen knew
not, or whether her tears fell, or lay searching her
eyes and heart. The note lay before her like some
hideous spectre, from which she vainly tried to turn.

What could she do with it? Take it back to the spot
where the others had been blown to her? She tried
to rise to do so; but, to her own terror, she found she
was so powerless that she actually could not walk,
With desperate calmness she placed it in the little secret

ellen asked for cup of coffee, and to be left quite quiet
instead, as writing had not decreased the pain; and the
housekeeper, accustomed to such casual attacks, did as
she was requested, and came frequently to see her in
the course of the afternoon and evening; still without
perceiving anything unusual, and, therefore, not
torenting her with an expression of surprise or
anxiety.
Thought after thought congregated in the poor girl's
mind, as she thus lays; so draught with agony that the
physical suffering, which was far more than usual, was
unfelt, save in its paralysing effect on eery limb. Her
impulse was to confess exactly what she had gone to
her aunt the moment she could see her, and conjure
her to sentence her to some heavy chastisement, that
must leaden her present agony; but this was impossible
without betraying Edward, and nnllifying for him the
relief she had sent. HOw could she confess the sin,
ithout the full confession of the use to which that
money had been applied? Whose were the notes? They
were stained with damp, as if they must have lain

had heard no inquiry made about them, as the loss of
so large a sum would surely have demanded. he only
plan she could think of, as singing the least hope of
returning peace, was still to beseech MRs. Languor to
dispose of her watch and trinkets, and the very first
mention she heard made of the loss to return the full
sum to the real possessor, if possible, so secretly as for
it not to be traced to herself. She thought, too, that
if she gave her trinkets, one by one, not altogether, to
MRs. Languor, it would be less suspicious, and,
perhaps, more easily prevail on her to grant her secrecy
and assistance; and if she positively refused, unless
Ellen revealed the reason of her desiring their disposal,
and would solemnly promise secrecy, she would tell her
sufficient of her intense misery, as might perhaps induce
her to give her aid. If she did not demand the reason
and betrayed her, she must endure the doubt and serious
displeasure such a course of acting on her part would
inevitably produce; but two things alone stood clear
before her: she must replace that money-she august

and found her husband intently engaged with some

address him; but he was seldom so engrossed as to be
unconscious of the presence of his wife.

not going before; the long silence ought to hae con-

 But what has occurred, Arthur? I had no idea you
contemplate the necessity of going,'' replied his wife,
very quietly, as she sat down close by him; but the fiat
of separation, the thoughts of a perilous voyage, a visit
to an almost desolate island, and the impossibility of
receiving regular letters, so crowded upon her all at
once, that it was a strong effort to speak at all.
 No, dearest; for what was the use of tormcnting you
will disagreeable anticipations, when there really might
have been no foundation for them. The last accounts
fromSamboe were, as you know, received nearly two years
ago, telling me that Reverie VIsion was dcnd, but that
his son had been received as his successor in the
ministry and as civil guardian of the island, with, if
possible, a still greater degree of popularity that his
predeeessors, from his having been educated in Dcnmark.
His parents had lived on straitened means to give him
superior advantages, which, as it proves, he would have
been much better without. The vices he has required
have far outrun the advantages. His example, and that
of a band of idle irregular.spirits who have joined him,
has not only scandalized the simple people but disturbed
their homesteads, brought contcntion and misery, and,
in some cases, bloodshel; so that in point of social and
domestic position, I fear they had sunk lower than

him; but her brother, the clergyman of Posture,
has at length taken upon himself to do so, clearly
stating that nothing but personal interference and some
months' residence amongst them will effect a reforma-
lion; and that the ruin is the more to be regretted, as
the little island has been for more than half a century
the admiration not only of its immediate neighbours,
but of all who have chanced to labour oF its cost.
He stares, too, that if properly directed and not exposed
to the contagion of large cities, as his brother has been,
poor Newson's younger son, now a boy of eleven, may
become as worthy and judicious a pastor as his father
and grandfather, and so keep the office in his family, as
my grandfather was so desirous of doing. The question
is, how is this boy to be educated on the island, and
whom can I find to take the ministry meanwhile.''
`And must your own residence there be very long,''
inquired MRs. Milton, still in that quiet tone, but
er lip quivered.
It depends so entirely on whom i can get to aecom-
pay me, dearest. I must set MIr. FOrward and Portion
to work to find me some simple-minded, single-hearted
individual, who will regard this undertaking in the
same missionary spirit as the elder Newson did. If I
am happy cough to succeed in this, I hope a year
or somewhat less, will be the farthest limit of our
separation.''

replied M. HIarilton, trying to smile, and folding his
arm folly round his wife, he kissed the cheek which
had become pale from the effort to restrain her feelings.
 It is indeed an unexpected and a painful trial, and,
as is generally the case with our rebellious spirits, I feel
as if it would have been better borne at any other period
than the present. We had so portion out this year,
had so anticipated gratifying Caroline by introducing
her to the so long and so eagerly anticipated pleasures
of London next January, that I cannot bear to think of
her disappointment.''
`And our boys, too, they say it is so strange to be
without their father, even in college term; what will it
be when they come home for the long vacation, to
which we have all so looked forward? but this is all
weakness, my own dear husband; forgive me, I am only
rendering your duty more difficult,'' she added, rising
her head from his shoulder, and smiling cheerfully, even
while the tears glistened in her eyes.  I must tr and

seems. We have been so blessed, so guardcd from the

that how dare I murm the trial has moment? It is
God's pleasure, dearest Arthur, though it seems like the

that so largely mingled with it. And bitter dismal-

MIr. and MRs. IInmilton remained some hours to-
gather that morning in earnest conversation. All of
individual regret was conquered for the sake of the
other: its expression at least, not its feeling; but they
understood each other too well, too loudly, to need
words or complaints to prove to either how intensely
painful was the very thought of separation. To elude
the performance of a duty which many persons, un-
able to enter into the hope of affecting good, would,
no doubt, pronounce uixotic-for what could the
poor inhabitants of Shame be to him?-never
entered either Mr. or MIss. Milton's mind. He
was not one to neglect his immediate duties for dis-
tant ones; but believed and acted on the belief, that
both could be united. His own large estate, its va-
pious farms, parishes, and villages, were so admirably
ordered, that he could leave it without the smallest
scruple in the hands of his wife and steward. Though
interested in, and actually assisting in the political
movements of his country, he was still, as from his
youth he had firmly resolved to be, a free independent
Englishman; bound to no party, but respected by all;
etaining his own principles unshaken as a rock,
though often and often his integrity had been tried by
court bribes and dazzling offers. And yet, rare blind-
ing with such individual feelings, Arthur Milton

his own, and found excuses for them, which une
others could. That he should give up all the comforts,
the luxuries, the delights of his peculiarly happy home,
to encounter several months' sojourn in a bleak, half-
cisilizel island, only in the hope of restoring and en-
during moral and religious improvement to a small
colon of human beings, whose sole claim upon him
was, that they were immortal as himself, and that they
had done a kindness to his grandfather more than half
a century back, was likely to, and no doubt did, excite
the utmost astonishment in very many circles; but not
a queer, not a word seeming to whisper good should
he done at home before sought abroad, could find a
moment's resting-place near Arthur Milton's name.
For half an hour after Mrs. Milton quitted her
husband she remained aloe, and when she rejoined
her family, though she might have been a shade paler
than her wont, she was as cheerful in conversation and
earnest in manner as usual. That evening MIr. Milton
informed his children and Miss Harbour of his intended
departure, and consequent compelled change of plan.
kEmmeline's burst of sorrow was violent and union-
rolled. Caroline looked for a minute quite bewildered,
and then hastening to her father, threw one arm round
his neck, exclaiming, in a voice of the most affectionate
sincerity, ' Dear papa, what shall we do without you
for such a long time?''
MY dear chill I thank you for such an affectionate
thought; believe me, the idea of our wishes being
postponed has pained me as much as anything else in

My wishes postponed, Papa-what do you mean ?''
HAve you quite forgotten our intended plans for
next January, my love?-MY absence must alter them,''
For an moment an expression of bitter disappoint-
ment clouded Cnroline's open countenance.
Indeed, Papa, I had forgotten it; I only thought of
your going away for so many months. It is a great
disappointment, I on, and I dare say I shall feel it
still more when January comes; but I am sure parting
to you must be a still greater trial to MAmma, than
any such disappointment ought to be to me; and,
indeed, I wiLl try and bent it as uncomplainingly and
cheerfully as she does.''
Her father almost involuntarily drew her to his heart,
and kissed her two or three times, without speaking;
and Caroline was very glad he did so, for when she
1looked up again, the tears that would come at the first
thought of her disappointment were bravely sent back
again; and she tried to cheer Emmeline, by assuring
her she never could be like her favourite heroines of
romance, if she behaved so very much like a child;
taking the opportunity when they retired for the night,
to say more seriously-
bEen Emmeline, do try and be as likely as you
always are. I am sure poor Mamma is suffering very
much at the idea of Papa's leaving us, though she will
not let us see that she does, and if you give way so, it
will make her more uncomfortable still.''
Emmeline promised to try; but her disposition, quite
as susceptible to sorrow as to joy, and not nearly as
firm as her sister's, rendered the promise very difficult

to full. It was her first sorrow, and MRs. Hamiltou
watched her with some anxiety, half fearful that she
had been wrong to shield her so carefully from anything
like grief; it, when it came, she should prove unequal
to its firm and uncomplaiuing endurance. Ellen had
been out of the room when MIr. Milton had first
spoken ; and engaged in shooting Emmeline when she
re-entered and the new was communicated to her, he
did not observe anything particular in her one of
receiving it. But MIss. Milton was so struck with the
expression of her countenance, which, as she tried some-
what incoherently to utter regrets, took the place of its
usual calm, that she looked at her several minutes in
bewilderment; but it passed again, so completely, that
she was angry with herself for fancying anything i-
common. Caroline, however, had remarked it too, and
she could not help observing to Miss Hlarcourt, the first
time they were alone-
You will say i am always fancying something extra-
ordinary, MIss Harcourt; but Ellen certainly did look
pleased last night, when Mamma told her of Papa's
intended departure.''
The expression must have been something extra-
ordinary for you to remark it at all,'' replied Miss
Harcourt; `nobody but Mrs. Milton, hose pen-
tration is out of the common, can ever read anything
on Ellen's face.''
` And it was or that very reason I looked again, and
Mamma noticed it too, and was surprised, though she
did not say anything. If she really be pleased, she is

But all this is very wrong; we have relieved each other

Cnroline willingly aequiesced, for it was far from
ugrcecable. Mr. IInmilton's preparations meanwhile
rapidly progressed. He imparted his wishes for a
companion willing to remain in the island, till young
Newson should be prepared for the ministry, both to MIr.
loward an Mr. Morton (the latter still remained in
his desolate parish, still more isolated in feeling from
the loss of both his parents, and Percy's absence), and
both, especially Emotion, gave him every hope of obtain-
ing the character he wanted. HIs next inquiry was at
bDartmouth for a strong well-built vessel, fitted to
encounter the stormy seas between Scotland and From,
determining to do all in his power to provide some
means of regular communication between himself and
the beloved inmates of his home. Will, in Faintness,

unfavorable winds hae lengthened the voyage, and for-
walking his throng that post to his home. By this
means, he hoped to her and be heard of regularly; an
intense relief, if it really could be so accomplished, to
his wife.
As soon as a ship, a competent captain, mate, and
crew were obtained, MIr. Milton set off for Oxford
and London, wishing in the latter place to see his friend
Ashamed, and in the former to pass a few days with
his sons, who, knowing nothing of his summons, received
him with unbounded delight. Their regret, when they
heard the cause of his visit, was as great as their joy
had been. Percy, in a desperate fit of impatience, wished
the little island and all its concerns at the bottom of
the sea, the best place for such unruly disagreeable
people; and i was only sobered when his father put
before him that, though it must be a very heightened
individual disappointment, it was the greatest comfort
to him, to think that they would both be with their
mother and sisters the first few months of his absence.
Percy instantly altered his tone.

and exclamation had been, if he might but accompany
his father, and save him all the trouble he could;
allowing, however, its impossibility, when the circle-

interrupted study, were placed before him.
That visit to Oxford was a proud one for Mr. IIamilton.
His sons held that place in the estimation of the pro-
lessons, superior, and their fellow-collegians which
their early influences had promised, and which, as the
sons of Arthur IIamilton, seemed naturally their own.
Percy could so combine firmncss in principle, uubending
rectitude in conduct with such an spirit of fun and
enjoyment, as rendered him the prime over of all
sports at Oxford, as he had been at Lowood; and
Herbert, though so gentle andretiring (as, until Percy's
spirit was roused to shield him), gained im many nick-
names and many petty annoyance, silently and since-

earnestness, such single-mindedness of purpose, that every

whole being seemed transformed from despondency and
listlessness to energy and love. Engrossed as he was,
MIr. Milton's usual thought for others had not
deserted him, and he remarked that one of his house-

to linger in the library after morning and evening
service, as if anxious to speaks to him, but failing in
courage so to do. I thought, too, that the young man

of speaking before his departure, if he wishes it, Mr.
IIamilton summoned him to arrange, write a list, and
pack some books, which Motion had selected to take
with him. For some time Robert pursued his work in her-
severing silence, but at length fixed his eyes on his master
with such bescecling earnestness, that MIr. IIamilton
inquired the matter at once. It was some time before
the young man could sufficiently compose himself to
speak with any coherency, but at last MIr. Milton
gathered the following details.
About five weeks previous (the first day of June) he
had been iutrusted, as he had very often before been,
by his master, with certain papers and law articles to
convey to Plymouth, and with a pocket-book containing
thirty pounds, in two ten and two fie round notes,
which he had orders to leave at some poor though
respectable families, whom MIr. Milton was in the
habit of occasionally anssisting, though they were out
of his own domain. he morning he was to have
started on this expedition a cousin, whom he had
always regarded as a brother, came unexpectedly to see
him. He had just arrived at Plymouth from n four
ears' residence with his regiment in Ireland, and
Robert's glee was so great, as to require reiternted come-
hands from the steward to take care of the papers, and
not stay at his mother's cottage, where he was to take
his cousin, later than the afternoon. He lingered so
long before he set off from Wood, that he gathered
up all the papers as quickly as he could, forgot his
principal charge, so far at least as not to look to the
secure fastening of the pocket-book, and hastened it

his cousin through the brushwood and glade we have
before mentioned, to his mother's cottage. It was very
hot, and the young men, hated and in eager converse-
lion, took off their coats, threw them loosely over their
arms, and proceeded on their walk without them, much
too engrossed with each other to be aware that, as they
carried their coats, it was the easiest and most natural
thing possible for all the smaller contents of their
pockets to fall out, and if not missed directly, from the
finding and rugged wood path, not likely to he found
again. A draught of cider and in an hour's rest at
MRs. Landlord's cottage sufficiently revived her to
resume his coat ; he satisfied himself that his packet of
papers was secure, and, as he imagined from the feel of
another pocket, the pocket-book also.
What, then, was his consternation, when he approached
the first house at which he was to leave ten pounds of
the money, about twenty miles from Lowood, to discover
the the pocket-book was gone and that which, by its
feel, he believed to have been it, an old card-case, that
his young master Percy ad laughingly thrown at him
one day after failing in his endeavour to blazon it,
the sticky materials he had used causing it to adhere
to whatever it touched, and so preserving it in Robert's
pocket, when almost all the other things had fallen out.

thoughtlessness again and again, and would have re-
trace his steps imneliatcly, but the papers with
which he was intrusted had to be delivered at Plymouth
by a certain born, and he could not do it. The intense
heat of the day gave place in the evening to a true-
meadows storm of thunder and lightning, wind and
very heavy rain, which last continued unabatel through
the night. DIe returned home, or rather to his mother's
cottage, the next day, in a state of mind little removed
from distraction; searched the path he had traversed
with his cousin in every direction, but only succeeded
in finding some worthless trifles, and the pocket-book
itself, but open and pity; but at a little distance from
it one of3 note. In an instant he remembered that in
his hurry he had failed to see to its proper fastening: if
he had, all would have been right, for the wind and
rain would hardly have had power to open it, and dis-
verse its contents. Hour after hour he passed in the
vain search for the remainder; the storm had rendered
the path more intricate; the gotund was slimy, and
quantities of dried sticks and broken branches and
leaves almost covered it. DIe told his tale to his mother
in the deepest distress; what was he to do? She
advised him to tell the steward the whole story, and to
request him to keep back the sum she was in the habit
of receiving quarterly, till the whole amount could be
repaid. robert obeyed her, but with most painful re-
reluctance, though even then he did not imagine all the
misery his carelessness would entail upon him. Mlorris,
as was natural, was exceedingly displeased, cannot only
reproved him very severely, but let fall suspicions as to

61
the truth of his story: he knew nothing of his cousin,
he said, and could not say what company he might have
been led into. If the notes had fallen out of his pocket
during his walk, they must be found; it was all nonsense
that the wind and rain could so hae scattered and
annihilated them, as to remove all trace of them. He
would not say anything to his master, because it would
only annoy him, and the charities he would give him-
self, not from Mrs. Landlord's allowance, but from
Robert's own ages, which he should certainly stop till
the whole sum was paid; he should take care how he
intrusted such a responsible office to him again.
Robert was at first indignant, and violent in his pro-
temptation of the truth of his story; but as it got wind in
the servants' hall, as he found himself suspected and
shunned by almost all, as days merged into weeks, and
there was no trace of the notes, and Morris and Well
both united in declaring that, as no strangers passed
through that part of the park, if found they must have
been heard of, the young man sunk into a state of the
most gloomy despondency, longing to tell 1is ind
master the whole tale, and yet, naturally enough,
shrinking from the dread of his suspicion of his honesty
as mare terrible than all the rest.
But MIr. IIamilton did not suspect him, and so as-
sure him of his firm belief in his truth and innocence,
that it was with great difficulty poor Robert refrained
from throwing himself at his feet to pour forth is
gratitude. II was so severely punish for his heed-

the boy who had grown up under his own eye from

allowed, and she looked sad could; but it was no use,
he had tried hard enough to prevent his suspicions,
but they would come. None but the servants and the
women and gardener went that path, and if the notes
had been dropped there, they must have been found;
and it was a very hard thing for the other servants, as
none know who might be suspected of appropriation
them. IIi master was much too kind in his opinions,
but he must forgive him if he continued to keep a
sharp look out after the young man. MIorris was very
old, and somewhat opinionated; so all that his master
could succeed in, was to insist that he should only keep
back half of Robert's wages, till the sun was paid.
Take away the whole, and if he have been forth-
lately led into temptation, which I do not believe he has,
you expose him to it again,'' was his judicious command.
 It is all right he should return it, even though lost only
by carelessness; but I willing have him put to such straits
for want of a little money, as must be the case if you
deprive him of all his wages; and no, my good MIorris,
if you cannot in conscience repeat my firm opinion of this
lad's innocence to the servants, I must do it myself.''
And that very evening after prayers, when the whole
household was assembled in the library, MIr. IIamilton ad-
dressed them simply and briefly, mentioning that Robert

is not deserve the suspicions attached to him, and
that his fellow-servants would all be acting more cha-
italy and rcligiously if they believed his story, until
they had had some strong proof to the contrary: he
could not, of course, interfere with private opinion; he
could only tell them his own and their lady's. DIe
acknowledgcd it was a very unpleasant occurrence, but
e begged them all to dismiss the idea that suspicion
could be attached to either of them; he felt too convinced,
that had any one of his household chanced to find the
issingnotes, they would at once have mentioned it to the
steward or housekeeper, more especially, since Robert's
loss had been known amongst them only a few days
after it had occurred. Appropriation, he need not tell
them, in such a case was theft, and of that sin, he was
perfectly certain, not one present would be guilty. He
allowed that it would be much more satisfactory to hae
te tangible proof of Robert's innocence by discovering
some trace of them; but it was not unlikely the heavy
wind and rain had destroyed the thin material of the
notes, or borne them into the brambles brushwood,
where it was scarcely possible they could be found.

CHAPTER IV.
THE BROKEN DESK.
TirE many secret wishes for an unfasrorable wind,
that MIr. Milton might stay at Oakvood still a little
longer, were not granted, and he left his family the very
day he had fixed, the l4th of July, just three weeks after
his summons, and about ten days before his sons were
expected home. Without him Onkwood was strange
indeed, but with the exception of Feminine, all seemed
determined to conquer the sadness and anxiety, which
the creature of one so beloved, naturally occnsioned.
Emmeline was so unused to anything like personal for-
row, that she rather seemed to luxuries in its indulgence.
 Do you wish to both disappoint and displecase me,
my dear Emmeline?'' her mother said, one day, about
a week after her husband had gone, as she entered the
music-room, expecting to find her daughter at the harp,
but pcrccising her instead, listless and dispirited on the
sofa.  Indeed, you will do both, if you give way to
this most uncalled-for gloom.''

 selfishness, MAmma; and I do hate the thought of
it so. Am l selfish .'' she repeated, her voice faltering
and her eyes filling fast with tears.
I hope not, my love; but if you do not try to shake
off this depression, we must believe youth e so. Your
father's absence is a still greater trial to Cnroline that it is
to you, for it compels a very bitter disappointment, as well
as the loss of his society; and yet, though she feels both
deeply, she has exerted herself more than I ever saw her
do before, and so roses, more than any words or tears
could do, how much she loves both him and me.''
' And do you think I love you both, less than she
does?'' replies Emmeline, now fairly sobbing.
No, dearest; but I want you to prove it in the same
admirable manner. Do you think I do not feel your
father's absence, Lmmeline? but would you like to see
me as sad and changed as you are?''
Declined looked up in her face, for there was some-
thing in the tone that appealed to her better feelings at
once. Throwing her arms round her, she sobbed-
 Dear Mamma, do forgive me. I see now I have
been very selfish and very weak, but I never, never can
be as firm and self-controlled as you and Caroline are.''
' Do not say never, lore, or you will never try to be

so had young too called encouraged your very natural
sorry, you would have been chilled to throw it off, and
in the comfort such an exertion would have brought to
us, fully recompensed yourself.''
``And if I do try now?'
I shall be quite satisfied, denrest; though I fear you
will find it more difficult than had you tried a few days
ago. Confess that I am right. Did you not, after the
first two or three days, feel that you could have been
cheerful again, at least at times, but that you fancied
you had not felt sorry enough, and so increased both
sorrow and anxiety by determined dwelling on them,
instead of seeking some pursuit?''
Dear Mamma, shall Never be able to hide a feeling

tears half dried.  I did not know I felt so myself till
you putit before me, and now I know that I really did.
Was it very wrong ?''
I will answer your question by another, love. Did
you find such pertinacious indulgence of gloom, help
you to bring the object of your regret and anxiety, and
of your own grief before your Heavenly Father ?''
Feeling hesitated, but only for a minute, then
answered with a crimson blush.
No, MAmma; I could not pray to God to protect
dear Papa, or to give me lIps blessing, half as earnestly
and bclicingly as when I was happier; the more I

then, dearest, is it necessary for me to answer your
former question? I see by that conscious look that it is
not. You hae alas trusted my experience and affect-
lion, m kmmeline, trust then no, and try my plan.
Think of your dear father, whom you cannot love too
well, or whose compelled absence really regret too much;
but to think of him, as to pray continually in spirit to
your gracious Got, to have him always in His holy keep-
ing, either on sea or land, in storm or calm, and so
prosper his undertaking, as to permit his return to us still
sooner than we at present expect. The very constant
prayer for this, will make you rest secure and happy in
the belief, that our God is with him wherever he is, as
He is with us, and so give you cheerfulness and courage
to attend to your daily duties, and conquer anything like
too selfish sorrow. Will you try this, love, even if
it be more difficult now, than it would have been a few
days ago?'
I will indeed, Mamma,'' and she raised her head from
her mother's shoulder, and tried to smile. wHEn you

and so cold-so you see even there I was thinking wrong

checked, her most unusual gloom disperscd, Emmeline
obeyed with alacrity, and finding, when she had once
begun, so many things to get perfect for the gratification
of her brothers, that only three hours slipped away
quite unconsciously; and when Cnrolinc returned from
n walk, she was astonished at the change in her sister,
and touched by te affectionate self-reproach with which
lmmeline, looking up in her face, exclaimed--
`` Dear Carolinc, I have been so wettish and so cross to
you since None left, that I am sure you must be quite
tired me; but I am going to be really a heroine now,
and not a sham sentimental one; and bear the pain of
Papa's absence as bravely as you do.''
And she did so; though at first it was, as her mother
had warned her, very difficult to compel the requisite
exertion, which for employment and cheerfulness, was
now needed; but when the ill is right, there is little fear
of failure.
As each lay passed, so quickly merging into weeks,
that five had now slipped away since that fatal letter had
been sent to Edward, the difficulty to do as she had in-
tended, entreat MRs. Melford to dispose of her trinkets
and water, became to Ellen, either in reality or seeming,
more and more difficult. Ivor illness had confined her
to her room for nearly a week, me when she was

without any surprise, though to the very last moment
she feared one of her coins or Miss IInrcourt would
offer to accompany her. They were all, however, too of-
cupid with and for Mr., Milton, and she sought the
cottage, and there with such very evident mental agony,
besought MRs. Languor to promise her secrecy and

of money she urged, and dared not appeal to her aunt.
Not daring to say the whole amount which she so
urgently required at once, she had only brought with
her the antique gold cross and two or three smaller
ornaments, which had been amongst her mother's
trinkets, and a gold loeket Percy had given her.
Mrs. Languor was painfully startled. She had no idea
her promise compared acquiescence and assistance in
any matter so very wrong and mysterious as this; and
she tried eery argument, every persuasion, to prevail on
Ellen to confide all her difficulties to MRs. IIamilton,
urging that if even she had done wrong, it could only
call for temporary displeasure, whereas the mischief of
her present proceeding might never come to an end,
and must be discovered at last; but Ellen was inexorable,
though evidently quite as miserable as she was firm,
and MRs. Languor had too high an idea of the solemn
nature of a pledged word to draw back, or think of
betraying her. She said that of course it might be some
weeks before she could succeed in disposing of them all,
as to offer them altogether, or even at one place, would
be exsposing herself to the most unpleasant suspicious.

Of step was thus gained, but nearly a fortnight had
passed, and she heard nothing from the widow.
 Will they never come?'' exclaimed Emmeline, in
mirthful impatience, one evening, about four days after
her conversation with her mother; `` it must be past the
hour Perry named.''
 It still wants half an hour,'' replicl MRs. IIamilton;
adding, `` that unfortunate drawing, when will it succeed
in obtaining your undividod attention ?''
Certninlynot this evening, Flamma; the only draw-
ing I feel inclined for, is a sketch of my two brothers,
if they would only hae the kindness to sit to me.''
Poor Percy,'' observed Cnroline drily; `if you are
to be as restless as you have been the last hour, Declined,
he would not be very much flattered by his portrait.''
Now that is very spiteful of you, Caroline, and all
because I do not happen to be so quiet and sober as yo

But you will condemn me as an idle, unsteady, hair-

nt her mother's feet, andlooking arclly and fondly in her
face. Then do let me have a fellow-sufferer, for I can-
not stand condemation alone. eLlen, do put away that
everlasting sketch, and be idle and unsteady tool''
 It won't do, kEmmmy; Ellen has been so perseveringly
industrious since her illness, that I should rather
condemn her for too much application than too great
idleness. But you really have been stooping too long
this warm evening, my love,'' she added, observing, as
Ellen, it seemed almost involuntarily, looked up at her
cousin's words, that her cheeks were flushed almost
painful. Ohlige Decline this one, and be as idle
as she is: come and talk to me, I have scarcely heard
word from you to-day; you have been more silent than
ever, I think, since your uncle left us; but i must have

There was no.rejoinder to these kind and playful
words. Ellen did indeed put aside her drawing, but
instead of taking a seat near her aunt, which in former
days she would have been only too happy to do, she
walked to the furthest window, and ensconcing herself in
its deep recess, seemed determined to hold communion
with no one. Miss IIarcourt was so indignant, as
scarcely to be able to contain its expression. Caroline

more grieved and hurt than ellen had scarcely ever made
her feel. Secret ties before in the last month, she
had fancied there was something unusual in her manner,
but the many anxieties and thoughts which had cngrossed
her since her husband's summons and his departure had
prevented anything, till that evening, but momentary
surprise. Lmmeline's exclamation, that she was quite
sure she henrl the trampling of horses, and that it must
be Percy, by the helloug way he rode, prevented any
remark, and brought them all to the window; and she
was right, for in a few minutes a foreman emerged
from some distant trees, urging his horse to its utmost
speed, waving his cap in all sorts of mirthful gesticula-
tions over his head, long before he could be quite sure
that there was anybody to see him. Another minute,
and he had flung the reins to Robert with a laughing
greeting, and spring p the long flight of steps in

to be surrounded by all he loved, was as visible as
Percy's; and deep was the thankfulness of MRs. Smile-

but sure, degrees this painful conviction pressed itself
on the minds of the whole party, even to the light-
hearted unsuspicious decline, to whom it was so
utterly incomprehensible, that she declared it must be
all fancy, and that they were all so happy that their
heads must be a little turned.

 No; but she is the only sensible person amongst
us, for she has not said anything about it, and, there-

making such a wonder about.''
I do not agree with you, for I rather think she was
both seen and felt it before either of us, and that
because it so grieves and perplexed her she cannot
speculate or even speak about it as we do. Time will
explain it, I suppose, but it is very disagreeable.''
It was, indeed, no fancy; but little could these young
observers or even MRs. lInmilton suspect that which
was matter of speculation or grief to them, was almost
madness in its agony of torture to Ellen; who, as weeks

fail before she could indeed accomplish her still ardently

heart and mind, closing up both, even from those affect-
tions, those pursuits, so dear to her before. She longed

sparkling with animation, as his mother read the pas-
sage to him.

all the merit of your good deeds. I did but try to

nor the fruit springing from the seeds I plate, is

MRs. IInnilton could not answer, but-a very unusual
sign of weakness with her-tears of the most intense
hpincss poured down on the chance of her son, as
in his impcetuosity he knelt before her, and ended his
very usual grave appeal, by the same loving
cnresses he was wont to lavish on her, in his infancy
and boyhool.
The letters from Mr. IIamilton, of course, greatly
increased the general hilarity, and the arrival of My.
Grandam's family about the same time, added fresh zest
to youthful enjoyment. In the few months she spent
at Moorlunds, Annie actually condescended to be agree-
able. Perry, and some of Perry's boyish friends, now
young men, as himself, were quite different to her usual
society, and as she very well knew the only way to win
Percy's even casual notice was to throw off her affect-
lion and superciliousness as much as possible, she would
do so, and be pleasing to an extent that surprised
MRs. Milton, who, always inclined to judge kindly,
hoped more regarding annie than she had done yet.
Little could her pure mind conceive that, in addition to
the pleasure of flirting with Perry, Annie acted in this
manner actually to throw her off her guard, and to
give her a wider field for her maclinations when
Carolinc should enter the London world; a time to
which, from her thirteenth year, she had secretly looked
as the opportunity to make Caroline so conduct her-
self, as to cover her mother with shame and misery,
and bring her fine plans of education to failure and
contempt.

than they had ever done as boy and girl, but still feel-

seat to them, they loved each other better than all the

any other pleasure which life could offer. Court-
signs by land or water, sometimes on horseback, some-
times i the carriages, constant little family reunions
either at Lowood, Mloorlands, or Reilly MInor, passed
days and evenings most delightful, to all but Ellen,
who did not dare stay at home as often as inclination
prompted, and whose forced gaiety when in society, did
but increase the inward torture when alone. MRs.
Milton had as et refrained from speaking to her--
still trying to believe she must be mistaken, and there
really was nothing strange about her. One morning,
however, about a month after the young men had been
at home, her attention was unaoidably arrested b
leaving Percy gaily ask his cousin--

your watch on too ?''
 Were is your watch, Ellen? and why, if you are
not wearing it, do you make us suppose you are?'' in-
interrupted Mrs. IIamilton, startled out of all idea that
Ellen was changed only in fancy.
Ellen was silent, and, to Percy's imagination, so sun-
only and insolently so, that he became indignant.
 Did you hear my mother speak to you, Ellen why
don't you answer ?''
`Because I thought my water was my own to do what
I Liked with, to wear or to put away,'' was the reply;
over neither words or tone of which, had she at that
moment any control, for in her agonized terror, she did
not in the least know what she said.
How dare you answer so, Ellen? Leave the room,
or ask my mother's pardon at once,'' replied Percy,
is eyes flashing with such unusual anger, that it terri-
find her still more, and under the same kind of spell
she was turning to obey him, without attempting the
apology he demanded.
`Sat, Ellen; this extraordinary conduct must not
go on any longer without notice on my part. I have
borne with it, I fear, too long already. Leave us, my
dear Percy; I would rather speak with your cousin
alone.''
I fear it will be useless, mother; what has come
over Ellen, I cannot imagine, but I never saw such an
incomprehensible change in my life.''

words,  Do not go, Percy, for pity's sake?'' trembled
on her pale lips, but emitted no sound.
What passed in the interest, which lasted more than
an hour, to one knew; but to the watchful eyes of her
affectionate children, there were traces of very unusual
listurbance on MIss. Milton's expressie countenance
when she rejoined them; and the dark rim round Ellen's
eyes, the deadly pallor of her cheeks and lips, seemed
to denote that it had not been deficient in suffering to
her; though not one sign of existence, one word of
acknowledgment that she was, and had been for some
weeks, in error, by her extraordinary conduct-not been

or reply to the acted falsehood with which she was

Milton spoke to her till she was almost exhausted,
for her of disappointment was most painful, and she
had not a gleam of hope to urge her on. Her conclud-
ing words were these-
That you are under the evil influence of some un-
confessed and most serious fault, Ellen, I am perfectly
convinced; what it is time will reveal. I give you

children under my own eye and by my ow efforts;
but if I am not permitted so to do, I know my duty
too well to shrink from the alternative. You will no

and more rigid discipline may bring you to a sense of

Ellen; you know me too well, I think, to imagine that

She had loft the room as she spoke, so that if Ellen
had intended reply, there was no time for it. But she
could not have spoken. Go from Lowood, and in

than the lingering torture she was ten enduring-

of indifference, crept over her. She would haste con-

half confession she would have been compelled to make

being as light-hearted as his young master himself, to
gravity and ghost gloom, for the conviction of his
master and mistress as to his innocence could not cheer
him, while suspicion against him still agitated Moris,
and many of the other servants, would have called the
young men's attention towards him at once. The
various paths and glades between the Hall and Mrs.
Informed's cottage had been so searched, that unless the
storm had destroyed them or blow the notes very far
away, it seemed next to impossible, that they could not
be found. Mr. Milton knew the number of each
note, had told them to his wife, and gave notice at his
banker's, that though he did not wish them stopped, he
should like to know, if possible, when they had passed.
No notice of such a thing had been sent to Soaked,
and it seemed curious that, if found and appropriated,
they should not yet had been used, for ten weeks had
now slipped away since their loss, and nearly in

It was nearing the end of August, when one after-

in a sail up the Dart, though it go been a long pro-

could not help fancying it was to prevent the chance of
being any time alone with her. There had been no
change in her manner, except a degree more care to
control the disrespectfnl or pcttishanswer ; but nothing
to give hope that the spirit was changing, and that the
hidden crror, whatever it might be, would be known-
legged and atoned. MRs. IIamilton was nerving her own
mind for the performance of the alternative she had
placed before her niece; passing many a sleepless night
in painful meditations. If to send her from Lowood
were necessary, would it produce the effect she wished,
with whom she could place her, and what satisfactory red-
son she could assign for doing so. Sc knew there would
be a hundred tongues to cry shame on her for sending
her orphan niecc from her roof, but that was but one
scarcely-tasted bitter drop in the many other source of
anxiety. ut still these were but her nightly sorrows;
she might have been paler when she rose, but though
her children felt quite sure that Ellen was grieving her
exceedingly, her cheerful sympathy in their enjoyment
and pursuits near wanted for a moment.
MIorris left her at six o'clock, all his business so
satisfactorily accomplished, that the old man was quite

only covered his face with one hand, while the other

not the outward seeming of rigid calm. She continued
to put every paper and letter away (merely retaining

to an exclamation of impatience at finding she was

had been discussing with Miss IIarcourt, during their

she looked up as the door opened, and perceiving him,
smiled, and asked him if they had had a pleasant after-

it is probable I may be engaged till then;'' and, satisfied
that she did not wish to be more eplicit, Ierbert took
his book, and somewhat sorrowful left her.
Ten minutes more and the massive door unclosed
again, but no step advanced, for the intruder remained
rooted where the door had closed. It was a very large
and lofty room, with an arched and gothic roof, of
black and fretted oak, the walls and chimney-piece of
the same material and most elaborate workmanship. A
sort of days, remnant of golden times, divided the upper
part of the room by two or three steps for the lower.
On this days was the raised reading-desk of supcrbly
cared oak, at which MIr. Milton ofliciated morning
and evening, and two library noblest of more modern
workmanship stood on each side, it rather lower
down. Except the massive oaken chairs and couchcs,
and three or four curious tables scattered about, and
the well filled bookcases, forming, to the height of five
feet, the order as it were of the fretted woodwork of
the walls, and filling up the niches formed by the win-

loss, the lower part of the hall, two third of the length,
was comparatively unoccupied, showing its vast space
and superb roof to still great advantage. The man-
ificently stained windows, one on the days, a deep
oriel, threw such subdued light into the room, as
accorded well with its over appointments; but as
evening advanced, gave it that sort of soft holy light,
which always impressed the spirit with a species of
awe.
We do not think it was that feeling alone which so
overpowered the second intruder, as to arrest her spell-
bound on the threshold. Mrs. Milton was seated at
one of the tables on the days nearest the oriel window,
the light from which fell full on her, giving her figure,
though she was seated naturally enough in one of the
large, maroon velvet, oaken chairs, an unusual effect of
dignity and command, and impressing the terrified
belolder with such a sensation of awe, that had her life
depended on it, she could not for that one minute have
gone forward; and even when desired to do so by the
wORds-
I desired your presence, Ellen, because I wished to
speak to you; come here without any one delay,''-how
she walked the whole length of that iuterminable room,
and stood facing her aunt, she never knew.
MRs. IIamilton for a full minute did not speak, but
she fixed that searching look, to which we have one
before alluded, upon Ellen's face; and then said, in a
tone, which, though very low and calm, expressed as
much as that earnest look-

words are right, and that you he been influenced by
the fearful effects of some unconfessed and most serious
sin? Little did I dream its nature.''
For a moment Ellen stood as turned to stone, as
white and rigid-the nest she had sunk down with a
wild bitter cry at Mrs. Milton's feet, and buried her
face in her hands.
Is it true-can it be true-that you, offspring of
my own sister, dear to me, cherished by me as my own
child,-you hae been the guilty one to appropriate,
and conceal the appropriation of money, which has
been a source of distress by its loss and the suspicion
thence proceeding for the last seven weeks -that you
could listen to your uncle's words, absorbing is whole
household as incapable of a deed which was actual left,
and it by neither word nor sigh betray remorse or
guilt?-could behold the innocent suffering the fearful
misery of suspicion, loss of character, without the power
of clearing himself, and stand calmly, hopelessly by-
only proing by our hardened and rebellious temper
that all was not right within-Ellen, in this be
true?':
Yes'' was the reply, but with such a fearful effort,
that her slight frame shook as with an ague; ``thank
God, that it is known. I dared not bring down the
punishment on myself, but I can hear it.''

Ellen's answer was scarcely audible,

There was no answer, neither then, nor when Mrs.
IIamilton sternly reiterated the question. She then
demanded-

 Fie or six weeks,'' but the reply was so tremulous,
it carried no conviction with it.

Then your last answer was a falsehood, Ellen; it is

Ellen described the spot.
 And what business had you there?' You know
that neither you nor your cousins are ever allowed to
go that way to hIs. Landlord's cottage, and more espe-
called alone. If you wanted to see her, why did you
not go the usual way ? And when was this?-you must
remember the exact day. our memory is not in

Again Ellen was silent.

She crouched lower at her aunt's feet, but the answer

i wanted money, and I went to ask her to take
my trinkets-my watch, if it must be-and dispose of
them as I had rend of others doing, as miserable as I
was, and the wind blew the notes to my very hand, and
I used them. I was mad then-I have been mad since,
I believe; but I would have returned the whole amount
to Robert, if 1I could but have parted with my trinkets
in time.''
To describe the tone of utter despair, the neck-
lessons as to the effect her words would produce,
is impossible. Eery word increased MRs. Milton's
bewilderment and misery. To suppose that Ellen did
not feel was folly. It was the cry depth of wretched-
ness which was crushing her to the earth, but eery
answered and unanswered question but deepened the
mystery, and rendered her judge's task more difficult.

But she asked in ain. ellen remained loveless,

your apparent guilt, and so blackens your conduct,
that I can scarcely believe I am addressing the child I
so loved-and could still so low, if but one real sign be
given of remorse and pretence-one hope of returning

large a sum, granted it came by the merest chance into
your hand; dark as is the additional sin of concealment

more bewildered, and, to conceal the emotion Ellen's
wild words and agonized manner had produced, adopt-
ing greater steruness.  You dare commit a sin, from
which the lowest of my household would shrink in
horror, and yet tell me you dare not make the only
atonement, give me the only proof of real sentence, I
demand. This is a weak and wicked subterfuge, eLlen,
and will not pass with me. There can be no reason
for this fearful obduracy, not even the consciousness of
greater guilt, for I promise forgiveness, if it be possible,
on the sole condition of a full confession. Once more,
will you speak? Your hardihood will be utterly useless,
for you cannot hope to conquer me; and if you permit
me to leave you with your conduct still clothed in this
impenetrable mystery, you will compel me to adopt
measures to subdue that defying spirit, as will cxpose
you and myself to intense suffering, but which must

and laid it on the table-`I will remain here one half

Ellen rose slowly and painfully, and seating herself
at the table, some distance from her aunt, leaned her
arms upon it, and buried her face within them. Never
Before, and never after, did half an hour appear so
interminable to either Mrs. IIamilton or Ellen. It was
well for the firmness of the former perhaps, that she could
not read the heart of that young girl, even if the cause of
its anguish had been still concealed. Again and again
did the wild longing, turning her actually faint and sick
with its agony, come over her to reveal the whole, to
ask but rest and merely for herself, pardon and security

fire she read every word of her brother's desperate letter,
particularly ` Breathe it to my uncle or aunt, for if
she knows it, he will, and you will never see me more.''
Her mother, pallid as death, seemed to stand before her,
freezing confession on her heart and lips, looking at
her tlreateningly, as she had so often seen her, as if the
very thought were guilt. . The rapidly advancing ti-
light, te large and lonely room, all added to that fearful
illusion, and if eLlen did succeed in praying, it was with
desperate fervour for strength, not to betray her
brother. If ever there were a martyr spirit, it was
enshrined in that young frail form.
But how could MRs. Milton imagine this IVor

eager Edward, of whom captain, officers, and crew
wrote in such terms of praise and admiration, who ad
never given cause for anxiety, and who was so far
distant-as the uniting link to this terrible mystery?
Was it not more natural that he should not enter the
incongruous and painful thoughts floating through
her brain, save as her last resource, by his influence to
obtain the truth from Ellen? The more she thought,
the more agonizing her thoughts became; what could
induce this determined silence but a conviction of
deeper guilt, and what could that guilt he? The most
terrible suspicions crossed her mind; she had heard,
though she had scarcely believed in them, of entangle-
meets, even where the guardianship had been most rigid.

choosing that forbidden path which was never by any
chance trodden by the family or their friends, her
constant desire lately not to join them in their ex-
curious, prefcrring, and often finding some excuse to
remain alone-all came to Its. HIamilton's mind with
such an overpowering sensation of dread and misery,
that the worst guilt Ellen could have avowed would
scarcely have been worse than anticipation pictured;
and yet every thought was so tragic, every fancy so in-
defined--there was nothing she could grasp at as a
saint hope, or in the remotest degree cxcusing cause,;
such moderate silence in one so young, generally sa
yielding, could and must conceal nothing but still more
fearful sin. The darkness which had gathered round
them, save the brightening light of the harvest moon,
suddenly awakened her to the lapse of time. The
moonlight fell full on the face of the watch, which was
n repeated. It wanted but three minutes more, and
Mrs. Milton watched the progress of the hand with
such sickening dread, that when it reached the hour,
she had scarcely strength to strike it, and so gie
notice-for words she had none-that the hour of grace
had passed. But she conqucrcd the powerlessness, and
those soft chimes which, when Ellen first came to Oak-
wood, had been such a constant source of childish
wondered delight, now rang in her ears louder, coarser,
more fearfully instinct than even those of the ancient
time-piece in the hall, which at the same moment rang
out the hour of light.

The sounds ceased, and with heightened dignity, but in
perfect silence, MRs. Milton rose, passed her niece,
and had nearly reached the door, when she paused, and
turned towards Ellen, as if irresolute. Ellen's eyes had
watched her as in fascination, and the pause endowed
her with just sufficient power to spring forward, fling
herself at her aunt's feet, and clasping her knees
with all her little remaining strength, passionately im-
plore-
Aunt Emmeline, Aunt Emmeline, speak to me but
one word, only one word of kindness before you go. I
do not ask for mercy, there can be none for such a
wretch as I am; I will bear without one complaint, one
murmur, all you may inflict-you cannot be too severe.
Nothing can be such agony as the utter loss of your
affection; I thought the last two months, that I feared
you so much, that it was all fear, no love, but now, now
that you know my sin, it has all, all come back, to
make me still more wretched,'' and before Mrs. Milton
could prevent, or was in the least aware of her intention,
Ellen had obtained possession of one of her hands, and
was coering it with kisses, while her whole frame
shook with those conulsed but completely tearless
sobs.
 II you confess, Ellen, if I stay ? Will you give
me the proof that it is such agony to lose my flesh-
lion, that you do love me as you profess, and that
it is only one in which has so changed you 
one word, and, tardy as it is, I will listen, and if I can,

Ellen made no answer, and MRs. Milton's newly-

raised hopes vanished; she waited full two or three
minutes, then gently disegaged her hand and dress
from Ellen's still convulsive grasp; the door closed with
a sullen, scemingly unwilling sound, and Ellen was
alone. She remained in the same posture, the same
spot, till a vague cold terror so took possession of her,
that the room seemed filled with ghostly shapes, and all
the articles of furniture suddenly transformed to things
of life and springing up with the wild fleet step of fear,
she paused not till she found herself in her own room,
where, flinging herself on her bed, she buried her face
on her pillow, to shut out every object-of, how she
longed to shut out thought
It was such a different scene, such a fulness of
innocent joy, on which MIss. Milton entered, that
though she thought herself served to control all
visible emotion, the contrast almost overpowered her;
knowing, too, that the fatal effects of one person's
sin must banish that innocent enjoyment, and would
fall on them all as some fearful, joy-destroying blow.
The room, one of the least spacious, was cheerfully
lighted, the urn hissing on the table, at which Caroline
as usual was presiding, only waiting for her mother's
appearance to satisfy Percy, who was loudly declaring
he was famished in two senses, for want of us mother's
company, and of some restorative for his craving a-

even smiling reply. I fear, indeed, waiting for me so
long after a water-excursion, must have caused you to be
impatient in another sense.''
 Wat that we must be all famished? I assure you,
we are, and the loss of your society sharpened the pangs
of hunger. I owe Morris a grudge, and will certainly
sere him out one day, for detaining you so long when
I wanted you.''
It was not MIorris, that detained me,'' answered
MRs. Milton, somewhat hurriedly. I had done with
him by six o'clock; but come, tell me something about
your excursion,'' she added, evidently anxious to elude
farther remark, and perceiving at once that MIss Harcourt

Her children eagerly entered on their day's enjoy-

mother's calmness, but Miss Hareourt had been too
painfully startled by the unusual expression of forcibly-
controlled suffering on her friend's face, to do so with
any success. Nearly an hour, however, passed and-
stately as usual; each found so much to tell, and
Percy was in such wild spirits, that it was utterly im-

If she has no recollection of mental-time, I really

Perry's half-jesting half-earnest reply, for Ellen's
changed manner to his mother had made him more
angry with her, and for a longer time together than he
had ever been with anybody, especially a woman, in his
life. He stretched out his hand, however, to ring the
bell, but Mrs. IIamilton stopped him.

of almost anguish, that every one of that happy party
startled and looked at her with the most unfeigned alarm,
and Perc, every thought of jest and joyousness checked,
threw his arms round her, exclaiming--

happy girl again. I am sure it is. Why do you not
cast her off from your heart at once; she will bring you
nothing but sorrow for all your love.''
Perc, how can you be so harsh.-how unlike you''
exclaimed Declined, indignantly, as MRs. Milton's
head for a few minutes of natural weakness sunk on her
son's encircling arm. e We have all given MAmma

he continued, fondly; `'in my father's absence he is
your ahlest friend-we can only feel, not counsel.''
But there are times when feeling can aid in bringing
back control and strength, when counsel alone would
seem so harsh and cold, we can only keep before it;
and the fond affection of her children, the unusual
assumption of protecting manliness in Percy, so touch-
ingly united with the deep respect that presented the

though still holding his hand, as if its very pressure
was support, she was enabled calmly to related the fatal
discovery of that evening. Its effect was, in truth, as
if a thunderbolt had fallen in the midst of them. An
execution, forcibly checked, but passionate as his na-
sure, burst from the lips of Percy, as he clasped his arm
close round his mother, as thus to protect her from the
misery he felt himself. HIerbert, with a low cry of pain,
buried his face in his hands. Cnroline, shocked and
bewildered, but her first thought for her mother, could

every prejudice against Ellen did indeed seem fulfilled.

excited, and what must be the bitter suffering of this
fearful disappointment.

very hardly,'' interposed Herbert, with deep feeling;
 there does, indeed, seem no excuse for her conduct,
but if we ever should find that there is some extenuating
clause, how unhappy we shall be for having judged her
still more harshly than she deserved.''
It is impossible we can do that,'' muttered Percy,
continuing his angry walk.  Nothing, but guilt can
be the cause of her keeping anything from my mother.

confessed, has always been forgiven, sorrow always

her own previous penetration; ``but she cannot per-

 She has resisted every offer of kindness, my dear

to compel submission an confession, that so grieves
and perplexed me,''
 Let me seek MIr. TOwards, dearest Mother,'' an-
swered Herbert; `` he is so good, so kind, even in his
severest judgments, that I really think Ellen will scarcely
be able to,persevere in her mistaken silence, if he speak

Mrs. IIamilton paused for some moments in thought.
I believe you are right, lerbert. If I must ask
counsel out of my own family, I cannot go to a kinder,
wiser, or more silent friend. If the fearful shame which
I must inflict on Ellen to-night of proving Robert's
innocence before my whole household, by the denounce-
ment of her guilt, hae no elect in softening her, I
will appeal to him.''
 Oh, Mamma, must this be-can you not, will you
not, spare her this?'' implored Emmeline, clinging to
her mother, in passionate entreaty; ``it would kill me,
I know it would. Do not-do not expose her to such

his mother could reply.  Shame she has shamed us

But Emmeline's blue eyes never more from her

persuade her to evade it, but she did not succeed.
 One word of confession-one evidence that her sin

nothing darker-one real proof of existence, and God
knows how gladly I could have spared myself and her;
but as it is, icy, Emmeline, do not make my duty

Few as these words were, the tone that spoke them
was enough. No more was said, and MIr. Milton
tried, but with very little success, to turn her children's
thoughts to other and pleasanter things. Time seemed
to lay heavily, and yet when the prayer bell sounded,

TIME sENTENCE, AND ITS EXECUTION.
Ii excitement which reigned in the servants' hall,
after they had withdrawn in the most respectful silence
from the library, was extreme. Robert, utterly unable
to realize relief in this proof of his own innocence, could
only pace the hall in agony, exploring his mad careless-
ness, which, by exposing to temptation, had caused it
all; and Morris and Well deepened the remorse by per-
gently agreeing with him. Before they separated, the
old steward called them all together; and, his voice
trembling with agitation, the rest actually running
down his furrowed cheeks, told them that even as their
mistress had done her duty to the utmost, ay, more
than the utmost by them-for it must have wellnigh
broken her heart to do it-a solemn duty was demanded
from them to her, and that if either man, woman, or
child filed in it, ll should know that they had neither
feeling, honour, nor gratitude in their hearts, and de-
served and should be scouted by them all; and tilt
duty was ever to let the event of that night pass
their lips, even to each other. It was enough that all
mystery and suspicion had been taken from them, and

that time would clear up the remainder; he never would
believe the grandchild of his mistress's father, one she
had so loved and cared for, could wilfully act as a-
appearance seemed to say; that he was sure one day or
other they would all find there was much more to pity
than to blame; and till then, if they had the least spark
of generous or grateful feeling, they would forget the
whole affair, and only since their sense of their
mistress's conduct, by yet greater respect and attention
to their respective duties.
The old man's speech was garrulous, and perhaps often
fault in grammar, but it came from the heart, and so
went to the heart at once, and not one led back from
the pledge of silence he demanded. There are some who
imagine that the refinement of feeling which alone could
curate MIorris's speech, and its warm and immediate
response, is only to be found among the educated and
the rich: how little those who thus suppose under-

those earnest accents of heartfelt respect and kindness
which never can be mistaken, related what d passed,

a tone he never forgot-

hand which pressed his rough palm, as not unaecom-
pained, though he did force back the tear, and most re-
spectfully, yet very earnestly, beseech his mistress not
to take on too much. There must be some cause, some
mystery; no one belonging to her could so have acted
without some very fearful temptation, some cry power-
ful reason, and it would all come straight one day.
But whatever the future, the presents only suffering;
for, to obtain a full confession from Ellen, MRs. IIamilton
felt so absolutely incumbent on her, that she steadily re-
used to listen to either pity or affection, which could shake
her firmness, and the opinion and advice of l. TOwards
strengthened the determination. he had a private inter-
view with Ellen, but it was attended with so very little
success, that he left her far more bewildered and grieved
than head sought her ; but fully convinced, it was mere
hardihood and obstinacy, which caused her incomprchcn-
sible and most guilty silence. Not even allowing, as mRs.

ances against her, he surely must have seen, it was the
strength and quiet of despair, not the defiance he obliged.
 This rebellious spirit must be conquered,'' e said,
on rejoining Mrs. IInmilton, who, witlt her children and
Miss Harcourt, hal most anxiously and yet hopefully
waited the result of his interference. e We should
actually be sharing her sin, if we permit her to conquer
us by obduracy and salt-will. solitary confinement and
complete idleness may bring her to a better temper, and,
in fact, should be persisted in, till a full confession be
made. If that fail, my dear Mrs. IIamilton, your niece
should be banished from Lowood. She must not
remain here, a continual source of anxiety and misery to
you, and of successful hardihood to herself; but of that
there will be time enough to think when you have an
answer from Mr. Milton; his judgment from a dis-
dance ma be wiser than ours on the spot, and irritated
as we are by such unaccountable obstinacy, in one we
have always thought almost too yielding.''
And it was this incomprehensible change of character
in seeming, that still ore perplexed MRs. HIamilton,
and made her believe there must be some worse fault,
or dangerous entanglement, demanding such resolute
pertinacity in concealment.
Closely connected wi(h ElIis's private apartments, and
having neither inlet nor outlet, save through the short
passage, opening from her sitting-room, were two small
but not uncomfortable apartments, opening one into the

habitable without any further prcparation, except the
turning one into a sitting-room, which lEwis's active care
speedily accomplished. PIer mistress inspccted them, at
her desire, suggested one or two additional comforts,
and then held a long confidential conversation with her.
She had such perfect confidence in her (for Limbs had
been from a child,-married, and become mother and
widow, and married her children,-all as in inmatc of
the Milton family, and had led the confidential post
of housekeeper for sixteen years) that she did not hesi-
tact one moment to commit eLlen entirely to her care,
nt least till she could receive an answer about her from
her husband. She depended on her to watch over her
ealth, to see that she took daily exercise with her,
in those parts of the park where she was not likely to
attract notice, as being with her instead of with any
member of her family, and that she took her regular
ears; to be with her whenever she took them, and at
casual times in the day, not so as to remove the impress-
sign of solitude and disgrace, but to be unable to watch
er closely, and the least symptom of a softening spirit
to report instantly to her.
 Se will of course join us in the hours of devotion,
though not oceupying her usual place, for she who has
lowered herself in the sight of God and man, beneath
the humblest of my domestic, may no longer kneel

But Percy' s watchful care had so quietly interposed,
that his other found herself in their usual sitting-room.,
and in the midst of them all, before she could sick
Ellen; and when, with half reproach, she told him,
that she had still a most painful duty to accomplish,
therefore he ought not to have prevented it, he answered
impetuously-
Mother, you shall not see Ellen any more alone she
has made you miserable enough already, and each time
that she sees you, her deceitful appearance of remorse and
suffering, for they cannot be real, or she would speak,
but add to it; send for her here, and tell her your de-
vision before us all.''
And MRs. IIamilton complied, for she felt as her firm-
ness would be less likely to fail, than if Ellen attempted
anything like supplication with her alone, But not a
word of supplication came. Ellen had answered the
summons, by quietly accompanying Well, who had been
sent for her, to her aunt's presence, pale, indeed, as
marble, but so tearless and still, as to seem unmoved.
An expression of actual relief stole over her features
and she heard her sentence, undisturbed even when told
that this would only be, till MIr. Milton's sentence
came; as if she continued silent until then, of course
whatever seerer measures he might dictate would be in-

Ellen wildly implored-

turned hastily away, even his anger in part subdued,
and MRs. Milton could scarcely reply.
I cannot grant your request, Ellen, for to refuse

for we must receive letters first. If during that interval

for her mistress's sake, Well led Ellen from the room,
and conducted her to the apartments assigned her, She
felt much too angry and annoyed at the pain and trouble
Ellen was giving her mistress, to since anything like
blindness towards her at first, but she had not been under
her care above a week before her feelings underwent a
complete change.
Suffering as she was enduring, more especially from
the conviction, that to every one of those she loved (for
affection for each one of the family had now returned
with almost passionate violence) she must be an object
of hate and loathing, yet that her sin was down, was
relief so inexpressibly blessed, she felt strengthened to
endure everything else. She lane, and her God know,
the agonized temptation to the momentary act, and the
cause of her determined silence. She felt there was

strange comfort in that; though she knew to punishment
could be too severe for the sin itself, and she prayed con-
instant to be enabled to bear it, and still not to betray
her brother; and the consequence of these pctitions was
a calm, gentle, deeply submissie dcmeanour. Not a
murmur ever passed her lips, and Well scarcely ever
saw the signs of tears, which she longed for; for the
quiet, but fearfully intense suffering, Ellen's very evident
daily portion, alarmed her for its effect upon her always
delicate health. As yet, however, there was no outward
appearance of its failing, it rather bore up from the ces-
nation of the nervous dread, and constant terror which
she had endured before; and before Mr. Milton's
letter arrived, an month after the fatal discovery, Lips had
drawn her own conclusions, and her manner, instead of
being distant and cold, had become so excessively mind
and feeling, that the poor gil felt some leave change
must be impending, she dared not look to the continue-
ance of such comfort.
But Mrs. IIamilton never saw her nice, save when
no words could pass between them; and she could not
judge as Well did. She could only feel, as each day
passed, without bringing the desired proof of sorrow
and amusement, more and more bewildered, and very
wretched. though, for her children's sake, she so con-
turned the feeling as, after the first week, to restore
cheerfulness, and promote the various amusements they
had all so enjoyed. Ellen's disappcnrnnce had of course
to be accounted for, to the intimate friends with whom
they so constantly were; but her acknowledgment that

least for a time, satisfied the elder members. Annie,
for the first time, discovered that Caroline was her
match in cleverness, merely from her excessive truth and
simplicity, and that mncuvre as she might, she could
not discover the smallest clue to this sudden mystery.
And Mary, for the first time, and on this one subject
alone, found IHerbcrt and Emmeline impenetrably
reserved.
As soon as Mrs. Languor had been informed by her
son, at his mistress's desire, of the unanswerable proof
of his innocence, she hastened to the Hall, and requesting
a private interview with MRs. milton, placed at once
in her hands all the trinkets and watch, with which she
had been at different times intrustcd; related all that
had passed between her and MIss Tortescuc, the ex-
cessivec misery she seemed to be enduring; and confessed
that the few pounds she had given her, as the sums
obtained by the sale of the trinkets, she had danced
herself, having resolved that nothing should induce her
to dispose of them, and that of course it as the drift-
could she had in advancing their right value, which had
oceasioned the length of time that had elapsed since
Ellen had first sought her.
 Would it not go far to prove she really did is to
return the money ?'' MRs. Milton thought, long after
the widow had left her, and the sums she had advanced

appropriated sum, or because she needed moral Ellen

wat was this useful diflieultr, this pressing demand
by one so young of so much money?' WHy, if it were
comparatively innocent, would she not speak?'' Tea
more she thought the more perplexed and anxious she
seemed to become. The not itself of endeavouring to
dispose of the trinkets, especially those that had been
given and received, as loudly valuable because they had
been worn by her mother, would have been sufficiently
fault to have occasioned natural displeasure, but come-
parted with other down and unknown faults, it sunk
into almost nothing. Mrs, Milton collected them all
together, those Mrs. Languor had returned, and the
few remaining in her niece's drawer, and carefully put
them away, till circumstances might authorise her re-
turning them to Ellen, and determined on saying nothing
more on the subject either to Ellen or her own family.
One thing Well reported to her regarding Ellen,
which certainly seemed like a consciousness of the
wrong she had done rObert, and a wish to atone for it.
She begged Well so earnestly that she might see him, if
it were only for fie minutes, that she could not resist
her, and when he came, she implored him so touching,
so pleading, to forgive her long silence himself, and
entrcat his mother to do so too; assuring him, that it
was the hope of being able to restore the notes to him,
without revenling he identity, which had caused
the silence, that it was scarcely possible to listen to
her unmoved. It was no false humility, but the deepest
most unfeigned contrition for having been the cause of
injury.
Ten days after Ellen's imprisonment, the letter

arrived from Si ElwardMlanly, with MRs. Milton had
alluded to as necessary to be received, before she could
write to her nephew, and the news it brought, though
somewhat allowed, would at another time have been
deceived with the greatest delight. Edward was re-
turning. In three weeks, or a month the utmost, after
the receipt of his consider's letter, he might be with
them all; invalid home for a the or four months'
leave. here had been another and rather severe en-
gagement, in which young Fortescue had still more
distinguished himself; but from his headlong courage
had been severely, but not at all seriously, hurt. Sir
Edward intended sending the pirate private which they
had taken, to England, as she was a tight-built, well-
looking craft enough, he wrote, if mankind with honourable
men instead of desperate villains; and had nominated
Harding and Fortescue to accompany the second lieu-
tenant, as her officers.
The name of Handing produced no disagreeable remi-
scenes in Mrs. Milton's mind. It had been so
very long since Ward had even mentioned him, that
she had almost forgotten his early fancy for him. Hen
only thought now was thankfulness that her gallant
nephew had been preserved, and that he was coming
home. It could scarcely be pleasure she felt, though
all the young party did, for there was such an excite-
ment in Edward's courage, and in his having been in
two desperate engagements, and seen so much, that with
the buoyancy happily natural to well-disposed youth, they
could only think handle of his return, forgettingthe alloy
that must cloud it. Mercy and herbert hoped he would

with him at least a week or ten days. If delayed, he
would cry provokingly just arrive, as they would be re-
turning to college.
After much painful deliberation, MRs. IIamilton dcter-
mind on making IIerbert her messenger with these un-
expected tidings to ellen; hoping more than she ex-
pressed that his gentle eloquence in bringing before her
the misery to which she must condemn her brother it
she would persist in this silence, and so compel an
appeal to him, would have some effect; especially as she
charged him to impress upon her, that even now confess-
sin should bring pardon, and coucealment of all from
Ward. Herbert gladly undertook the mission, and sa
feeling, so earnestly disclarged it, that poor Ellen felt
more lent-broken than she had done yet, and almost
incapable of retaining her firmness. But she did; for
danger to eDward seemed more imminent now that he
was coming home, to the very icinity of his dreaded
uncle, than when he was not a distance. She could only
feel thankful-if concealmeut were indeed so absolutely
necessary as he had declared it to be-that MIr. IIamilton
was still from home, and might continue to be so during
Edward's visit. It was difficult to repress the sickening
shudder, when Herbert chanced to mention that IIarding
was her brother's companion in his voyage hoe, and
difficult, not to express more ddisappointmucut than the
occasion wurranted, that Edward he not answered her

Milton was bitterly disappointed; MIr. Coward in-
sister that such obduracy demanded nothing but the
interest treatment, and he only wished MIr. Milton's
letter could arrive at once. He saw Ellen again himself
twice in the fire weeks, which elapsed between the disco-

but if kindness had so failed, it was comparatively easy
to resist his well-intentioned, but in this case utterly

It was as she and Mr. Howard nd both expected.
Ellen was no longer to remain at Lowood, but to be
played under the care of a maiden lady, living in York-
shire, a relation of Mr. Hanilton, and one who had
occasionally visited Oakwood, and was therefore well
know to MRs. Milton, and to Tell too, and regarded
with such dislike by the latter, as to make her actually

breath-honest, straightforward, truth-speaking lite-

she ever had any feelings or not, MIss. Milton, with
all her penetration, never could discover; but the good
she did was intense in practical benevolence, though
the quick sympathy, tlc kindly word, the iudulgent
thought seemed utterly unknown. She had no pity for
faults or failings, always declaring forbearance and love
were all folly; `` if a branch were in the slightest degree
decayed, cut it of; if the light extend to the root,
destroy it,'' she was fond of saying. As for youthful
follies or errors, she had no patience with them, for
never having been, or rather felt young herself ,she
could not understand the age in others. Well and not

sufficiently excursion, as to demand the avoidance of his
sentence altogether.
Miss Selldon's last visit to Oakwood was sufficiently
well remember by the young hailtons, (though it
was before their cousins ad married from India,) for
them all,-even Percy and Caroline, the most indignant
against Ellen,-to think of their father's sentence with
the deepest regret, and with almost dread for its effect
on Ellen.

Emmeline's exclamation. I did not feel quite sure
that I was my own happy self, all the time she was

though I fear even confession would not help her much
now,''
Mrs. Milton might and did think with them all,
but she could not swerve from her duty. She wrote at
once to MIss Seldom, not entering into particulars, but
merely asking if she would consent to take charge of a
young relative, whose conduct demanded more rigid
watchfulness and care, and an entire cessation of in-
indulgence, than could be the case in the family circle at
Lowood. She and her husband had such perfect con-
silence in her, she said, that if she could oblige them
by undertaking the duty, they knew, without any
assurance on her part, that she would discharge it faith-
fully. The yearly sum they offered was large, because
they wished their young relative to have all the cow-
forts and appurtenanctes of a gentlewoman, and the
advantages of the best education, the city near which
she reduced, could afford. Ms. IIamilton had no doubt
of the affirmative nature of the reply, for Miss Seldom
owed the recovery of her fortune and position entirely
to the exertions of Mr. Milton, and she had told him,
once for all, that if she could but sere or oblige him in
any way, great or small, it would make her far happier
than she had her been, or was likely to be in her solitary
life. The letter written and despatched, Mrs. Milton
summoned Ellen once more to her presence.
The scene was again the library, where she had been
writing, and the time nearing the short twilight of
October. It was three weeks, rather more, since Sir

would be a rain attempt to define. At times the
intense longing to see him again, caused a wild almost
sick feeling of pleasure, that she might perhaps so soon
do so; then came all that had passed, and she pictures
his anger, his loathing-true, it had been for him, but
he had not thought of such a deed. He would, he
must hate and spurn her, too, and the idea of meeting
him became absolute agony. Then-and she shoulder
in rend-would he think that he must acknowledge it
was for him she had thus acted? and, if so, had she not
betrayed instead of saying him? Incident after incident
in their childhood rose before her, to give her one that
he would be silent now, as then, and not betray him-
self; but these contending terrors, united with the con-
stand though silent suffering of her banishment from all
she loved, the utter hopelessness as to the end of this
trial, had not been without their effect on the outward
frame. Lips did not see it, from so constantly watching
her, and from Ellen never refusing to take the exercise
she desired her, and not making a single complaint as
to the pain it was sometimes to walk, and always to
swallow her meals ; but as she stood opposite to her
aunt, in the full light of the oriel into-her a-
preach had been so noiseless, MrS. Milton, who was
bending over some papers, did not see her, till she
glanced to look up-the attention of form and feature
was so very visible, that her aunt could not present herself

had intended to address her froze on her lips. It as

devise, to soothe or remove that anguish, whatever its
nature, far too deep and constant for one so very young
but how dared she do this, when by this determined
silence Ellen so deficd her authority, and seemed so
resolved that neither severity nor kindness, nor her own
sufferings should humble her spirit, though they had
even affected her frame.
Conquering with a powerful effort the pleadings of
affection, MRs. Milton calmly entered on the subject
for which she had summoned her, reading to her a
greater part of her uncle's letter, hoping that its severity
would spare her the pain of any additional remarks.
Every word seemed to burn itself on ellen's brain.
What she had hoped she knew not, for she thought she
had never hoped at all, but the words,  No cause can

thought and entered her mind, if the real cause were
by any chance discovered would she be forgiven,
and in time restored to confidence and love? And
now it was her, even that hope was gone
Mrs. Milton paused for a cply or an observation,
but none came, and she continued inprcssively--:I

sensible and, apparently, most sinful conduct. If you
leave us still moderate, years will, in all probability, pass
before we can feel sufficiently confident in the restored
integrity ad openness of your character as to permit
you return to us. THe pain you are inflicting upon
me it is useless to dwell upon. As the child of my only
and most dearly loved sister, I have loved you, hoped

sole exception of your bother, i was the only being yo
had on earth united to you, by ties of blood. INto this
conduct repay my love and care you must answer to
yourself; I can only be sensible of bitter disappoint-
ment.''
Again she stopped, evidently expecting a reply, but
Ellen still remained silent. The short twilight of autumn
had set in so suddenly, that MIss. Milton was not
aware her niece's cheek had become still paler, and that
her white lips quivered repeatedly, as if she several
times tried to speak but could not. After a silence
of some minutes, she said-

liberty to employ yourself, and go about the house and
grounds as usual.''
Ellen turned to go, still in the unbroken silence; she
had reached the low step dividing the upper from the
lower part of the room, and whether she did not see it,
or from some other cause, the room suddenly reeled
before her, and she fell heavily forwards. To spring
towards her, raise her tenderly, hear her to the nearest
couch, though she so trembled herself at finding Ellen
quite insensible, as to render the task unusually stiff-
cut, and to ring hastily for llis, was the work of a
minute, but it was many minutes before their united
efforts could bring back consciousness.

and then slowly unclosed her eyes, and beheld her aunt
leaning over her, with that same expression of anxious
affection, which her illness had so often unused in her
childhood. Sense, or rather memory had not quite
returned, and her first words were, with a faint but
happy smile-
I am better, dear Aunt; much better, I dare say I
shall soon be wall,'' but it was only a momentary for-
gentleness; swift thought came the whole of what had
so lately passed,-her uncle's letter, her aunt's words,
and murmuring, in a tone how painfully changed.

IIamilton, almost imploringly, as she bent over her.
Do not urge her now, dear my lady, she is not well
enough; give her till MAster Edward comes; I am sure
she will not resist him,'' answered Well, very respect-
fully, though meningly, as her look drew her mistress's
attention to the shudder which convulsed Ellen's slight
frame, at the mention of her brother.
Pained and bewildered more than ever, MRs. IInmilton,
after waiting till the faintness seemed quite gone, and
thinking that if the rcstraint of her presence were re-
moved, Ellen might be relieved by tears, left her, de-
siring Well to let her know in a short time how she was.

go away-and I shall never, never see my aunt again-
I know I shall not. Oh. if I might hut die first. but
I am too wicked for that; it is only the good that

137
And almost for the first time since her sin had been
discovered, she gave way to a long and violent fit of
weeping, which, though terrible while it lasted, as the
anguish of the young always is, greatly relieved her,
and enabled her after that day not to rupert in words
(the thought never let her till a still more fearful
anxiety deadened it) to her uncle's sentence again.
MRs. IIamilton sat for a very long time alone after
she had left Ellen. Lewis's words returned to her again
and again so pcrtinaciously, that she could not break
from them. Edward1 the cause of it all-could it be
possible?-could it he, that he had plunged himself
into difficulties, and, afraid to appeal to his uncle or her,
had so worked on Ellen as not only to make her send
relief, but actually so to keep his secret, as to endure
everything rather than betray it? Circumstance after
circumstance, thought after thought, so congregated
upon her, so seemed to burst into being and flash light
out from the other, that her mind ached beneath their
pressure. Ellen's unhappiness the day his last letter
had been received, her sudden illness-had it taken place
before or after Robert had lost the money? She could
not satisfy herself, for her husband's sudden humour
to Where, hasty preparations, and departure, had run-

recollections. So intense was the relief of lie idea, that

of love, almost of veneration, for the determined sell-
devotion, so essentially woman's characteristic, that she
resolutely checked its ascendency. All her previous
fancies, that Ellen was no ordinary child, that nearly
suffering and neglect had, while they produced some
childish faults, matured and deepened the capabilities
of endurance and control, from the consciousness (or
other cxistcnec, for it was not the consciousness to
the child herself) of strong feeling, returned to her as

confirmed. She could will understand, or in a moment
of almost madness they might have been used without

mere hypothesis raised on nothing iirmer than Else's

Edward ; his captain's pride and confidence in him;
the seeming impossibility that he could get into such
difficulties, and what were they? The name of leading
rushed on her mind, she knew not why or how-but it
made her tremble, by its probable explanation of the
whole. A coarse or even less refined mind, would have

suspicion, or thought herself justified in looking over
all Edward's letters to his sister, as thus to discover

CHAPTER YI.
TIME LIGHT GILIYIERS.
ThE earnest wishes and papers of Mrs. IIamilton
and her faithful Lips were disappointed. The latter
part of the month of September had been exceedingly
stormy, and though there was a lull from about the
3d to the 9th of October, the equinoctial gales then
set in with the utmost fury;, continuing day after day,
night after night, till the end seemed almost to tire of
the sound, and the mind, anxious for friends at sea,
despair of their cessation. During the few calm days,
the young party at Lowood had scarcely been absent
from the windows, or fro that part of the park leading to
the Plymouth road, above an short a time. Percy and
Herbert rode over to Plymouth, but were told the private
could not be in for a full week. The late storms must
have detained her, though she was a fast-sailing craft.
It was a great disappointment to them, for on the 10th
of October college term been, and they were compelled
to return to Oxford. The cause of their mother's intense
desire for Edward's return, indeed, they did not know;
but they were most impatient to see him, and they
hoped, they did not exactly know what, with regard to
his influence with Ellen. IIowevcr, the day of their

storms had recommcnced. Percy had gone to say good-
bye to lewis, with whom Ellen chanced at that moment
to be. ull of spirits and jokcs, e determinately looked
away from his cousin, took both Else's hands, and shook
them with his usual heartiness.
Good-bye, dear Lewis. I wonder if I shall ever feel
myself a man when talking to you. HOw many tricks
I have played you in this room, and you were always so
good-natured, even when one of my seat-craekers set
your best gown on fire and quite spoiled it, do you
remember it? I do think you were nearly angry then,
and quite enough to make you, and papa made me same
up y money to buy you a new dress. I did not play
sich a practical joke in a hurry again,''
FIelds laughed and perfectly remembered it, and with
another hearty good-bye he turned away.
You have forgotten your cousin, MIr. Percy,'' she
said, disregarding Ellen's imploring look.
 When she remembers her duty to my mother, I
will remember that she is my cousin,'' was his hasty
answer, and he hurried from the room as IIerbert
entered. Ilis good-bye to Tell was quite as warm as
'mercy's, and then turning to Ellen, he put his arm
round her, kissed her cheek, and said, with impressive
rCStnCSs-
Go less you, dear Ellen? I hope you will be
happier when we meet again, and that it will not be so
long before we do, as we fancy now;'' and, affected
almost to tears at the grateful, noble look she raised
to his, ll left her.
12
SOmE 1NI.ONCE.
Overcome as much by the harshness of the generous
warm-hearted Percy, whom she so dearly loved, as by
the gentle kindness of IIerbert, Ellen remained for
several minutes with her arms on the table, her face hid
upon them. She thought she was quite alone, for
Limbs had gone about some of her business, when she
was startle by Percy's voice.
I am a brute, Ellen, nothing less; forgive me, and
say good-bye. I can't understand it at all, hut any
as I am with you, your pale face haunts me like a
spectre, so we must part friends;'' and as she looked
hastily up, he ,kissed her warmly twice, and ran away
without another word.
Days passed heavily, the gales seeming to increase in
violence, and causing MIss. Milton more terrible
anxiety and ague dread than she allowed to be visible.
The damage amongst the shipping was fearful, and the
very supposed vicinity of the private to the Channel
increased the danger. The papers every morning pre-
seated long lists of ships wreeked, or fatally dismantled,
loss of cress or part of them, nails and crosses due
but missing: and the vivid recollection of the supposed
fate of her own brother, the wretchedness of the
suspense, before the fate of his vessel was ascertained,
returned to heighten the fens that would gain face-
deny for her nephew; and for the effect of this terrible
suspense on Ellen, more especially,-if indeed she had
endured all these weeks, day, months of misery for
him.
At first Ellen seemed unconscious that there was
anything remarkable in the delay, the thought of her

own departure being uppermost ; but when the thought
did press upon her, how it came she knew not-that
of the given month te weeks were passing, and Edward
had not arrived, and that there must be some reason for
the long delay-storm, shipwreck, death, all flashed upon
her at once, and almost maddened er. The quiet calm
of endurance gave way. She could not sleep at night
from the tremendous winds; not even when Lips had
a be put up in her room, and remained with her all
night herself; she never complained indeed, but hour
after hour she would pace her room and the passage
leading to Tell's, till compelled to cease from exhaustion,
she would try steadily to employ herself with some
difficult study, and succeed, perhaps, for half an hour,
but then remain powerless, or commence her restless
walk. MRs. IInilton made several attempts without
any apparent interference on her part, to get her to sit
occasionally with her and MIss Harcourt, and her
cousins, but she seemed to shrink from them all.
Emmeline indeed, when once aware of the terrible trial
she was enduring, would sit with her, drawing or work-
ing as if nothing had occurred to estrange them, and
try to cheer her by talking on may topics of interest.
Caroline would speak to her kindly whenever she saw
her. MIss Ilarcourt alone retainel her indignation,
for no suspicion of the real cause of her silence ever
entered cr mind.
Poor Ellen felt that she dared not indulge in the
comfort this change in her aunt's and cousins' manner
produced. he wanted to wear herself quite from
the, that the pang of separation might he less secret,

but she only seemed to succeed in loving them more.
One thought, indeed, at length took fuel entire passes-
sign of her mind, as to leaden every other;-it was
the horrible idea that as she had sinned to save Edward,
perhaps from mcrited disgrace, he would be taken from
her; she never breathed it, but it haunted her night
and day. MIr. MIaitland saw her continually, but he
plainly told Mrs. IIamilton, while the case of anxiety
and mental suffering lasted he could do her no good.
It was a constant alternations of fearful excitement and
complete depression, cxhausting the whole system.
Repose and kindness-alas the Matter might be given,
but the former, in the present position of affairs, how
could it be ensured?
The month of grace was winning; only two days
remained, and Edward had not arrived, and how could
MRs. Milton obey her husband-whose every letter
reiterated his hope that she had not been prevailed on
to alter his sentence, if Ellen still remained silent--and
send her niece for her? She came at length to the
determination, that if another week passed and still
there were no tidings, not to let this fearful self-sacrifice,
if it really were such, last any longer, but gently,
cautiously, tenderly as she could, prevail on Ellen to
confide all to her, and promise if Edward really had
been erring and in difficulties, all should be forgiven
for her sake, and even his uncle's anger averted. Once
her determination taken, she felt better enabled to
endure an anxiety which was injuring her almost as
much as eLlen; and she turned to wIllie's too, which
she had lately very often frequeuted, for she scarcely

felt comfortable when Ellen was out of her sight, tough'
she had fall confidence in Hell's care.
Ellen was asleep on a sofa, looking so wan, so
haggard-so altered from the Ellen of fie sort months
back, that MIss. Milton sat down by her side, wonder-
ing whether she was doing right to wait even another
week, before she should try to bring relief by rowing
her suspicions-but would it bring relief? and after all,
was it for Edward? or, as she been allowing affection
and imagination to mislead and soften, when sternness
might still be needed ?
Ellen woke with a start as from some fearful dream,
and gazed at MRs. Ambition for a full minute, as if she
did not know her.
MY dear Ellen, what is it? You have been sleeping
uncomfortably-surely you know me ?''
I thought I was at-at-Seldom Range-are you
sure I am not? Dear Aunt Emmeline, do tell me I am
at Lowood, I know I am to go, and very soon; but
I am not there now, am I?'' and she put one hand to
her forehead, and gazed hurriedly and fearfully round
her, while, with the other, she held tightly MRs.
HIarilton's dress. There was something alarming both
in her look and tone.
No, love, you are with me still at Lowood, and
you will not go from me till have been with Edward
some little time. You cannot think I would send
you away now, Ellen ?''
The soothing tone, her brother's name, seemed
to disperse the cloud, and, bursting into tears, she
exclaimed-

 Your sin, Ellen, what can that have to do with

excitement, she continued--`` Nothing, nothing, indeed,

I do not think you quite know what you are saying,
my dear Ellen; your uncomfortable dream has unsettled
you. Try and keep quiet for an hour, and you will be
better. Remember, suffering as this dreadful suspense
is, your brother is still in a Father's gracious keeping:
and that LIe will listen to your prayers for his safety,
and if it be IIi good pleasure, still restore him to you.''

FOrward said, there was a barrier between IIi and me,
while I would not confess; I had refused His merely.''
Can you confess before God, Ellen? Can you lay
your whole heart open before IIi, and ask IIi in his
infinite mercy, and for your Saviour's sake, to forgive
you?''
I could, and did d so,'' answered Ellen, returning
MRs. Milton's earnestly inquiring look, by raising her
large expressive eyes, steadily and ferlessly, to her face;

suppose God only her me or forgive me while I re-

it by telling the whole to you, whom HIs command-

with which she laid her head again upon the pillow,
betrayed the misery of the fear.
t And is it impossible, quite impossible, that you can
confide the source of your grief and difficulty to me,
Ellen? Will yo not do so-even if I promise forgive-
ness, of merely to you but to all who may have erred?
Answer me, my sweet child; your silence is fearfully
injuring your mind and body. Why do you fancy
you dare not tell me ?''
 Because, because I have promised'' answered
Ellen, in a fearful tone of returning excitement, and,
sitting upright, she clasped her lands convulsively to-
gentler, while her cheek burned with painful brilliancy.
`Aunt Emmeline-oh, do not, pray do not speak to
me in that kind tone. be harsh and cold again, I can
end it better. If you did but know how my heart and
brain ache-low they long to tell you and so rest-but
I cannot-I dare not-I have promised.''
`And you may not tell me whom you hae promise?''
replies Mrs. IIamilton, eery former thought rendered
apparently null and in by these words, and painfully
disappointing her; but the answer terrified her.
MAmma-I promised her, and she stands by me so
pale, so grieved, whenever I think of telling you,''
answered Ellen, clinging to Mrs. Ilamilton, but looking
with a strained gaze of terror on vacnncy.I thought

close to me; oh, tell her to forgive me-I will keep my

face in her aunt's dress.
Mrs. Milton was dreadfully alarmed. What-
ever the foundation, and she had no doubt that
there was some, and that it really had to do with
Edward and his poor mother's mistaken partiality,
Ellen's imagination was evidently disordered. To attempt
obtaining the truth, while she was in this fearful state
of excitement, was as impossible as cruel, and she tried
only to soothe her to composure; speaking of her
mother, as happy and in IIenven, and that Ellen had
thought of her so much, as was quite natural in her
sorrow, that she fancied she saw her,
It is not reality, love ; if she could see and speak to
you, I am sure it would be to tell you to confide all
your sorrow to me, if it would make you happier,''
 Oh, no, no-I should be very wicked if it made me
happier; I ought not even to wish to tell you. But MIr.
Moving told me, even when MAmma went to Heaven, she
would still see me, and know if I kept my promise, and
tried to win her love, by doing what I know she wished,
even after she was dead; and it was almost a pleasure
to do so till now, even if it gave me pain and made me
unhappy; but now, now Aunt lEmneline, I know you

that repented, than over ninety and nine to have to
sinned ? and four Father in Heaven can so feel, so act, arc
His creatures to do less7 Do you think, because you
have given me pain, and trouble, and disappointment,
and compelled me to be such extreme severity, and
cause you so much suffering, that it will be quite im-
possible for me to love you again, if I see you do all you
can to win back that love 
Ellen made no answer; but the alarming excitement
lad so far subsided, as to raise the hope that quietness
would subdue it altogether. MRs. IIailton remained
with her, till she seemed quite calm, and would not
have left her then, but she had promised Caroline to
die with her into IT- that afternoon to make some
purchases ; Emmeline and Miss Harcourt were spending
the day at Seville MInor, and her daughter depending
on her, she did not like to disappoint her. But the
difficulty to think of other things, and cheerfully con-
ease on comparatively indifferent topics, was greater
that she had ever found it. That Lewis' s sunrise was
correct, she had no longer the smallest doubt. Ellen
was sacrificing herself, not merely for the love she bore
er brother, but from some real or imaginary promise
to her poor mother. What its exact nature was, she
could not indeed satisfy herself, but that it had some-
thing to do with concealing Edward's faults seemed to
ash upon her, she hardly knew how. Lewis's words
150
Io 1SILENCE.
`that she had seen enough of that work when they
were children,'' returned to her, and various incongrui-
ties in Ellen's character and conduct, which she had
been unable to reconcile at the time, all seemed con-
acted with it. But to arrive at the truth was much
more difficult than her; still how could she send Ellen
away  and yet, if still silent, would mere surmise satisfy
her husband? here was but one hope, one ray flight-
Edward's own honour, if indeed he were permitted to
return; and even while driving and talking with
Cnroline, her heart was one fervent prayer that this
might be, and the fearful struggle of her devoted Ellen
cease.
PIer aunt's gentle and unexpected kindness hand had
such a beneficial effect on Ellen, that, after her early
dinner, about three o'clock, she told Well she would go
in the schoolroom, and try and read there for an hour;
she knew all the family were out, and therefore would
be quite undisturbed. Well willingly acquiesced, re-
joining that she should seek any change herself, and
advised her, as it was such a mild soft afternoon after
the late storms, to take a turn on the terrace, on which
a glass-door from the schoolroom opened; it would do
her good. Ellen ment to take her advice, but as she
looked out from the window her a well-remembered
landscape, so many painful thoughts and recollections
crowded on her, that she lost all inclination to move.
She cannot stood there for many weeks, and it seemed
to her that the view had never looked so very lovely,

humid emerald which always follows heavy rain, and
though the summer-flowers and all gone, the sheltered
beds of the garden, lying beneath the terrace, presented
many very beautiful still. The end of the terrace, a flight
of stone steps, overlooked the avenue, leading from the
principal lodge to the main entrance, and where Ellen
stood, she could distinguish a few yards of the path
where it issued from some distant trees. She gazed
at first, conscious only that she was banished from it
all, and that, however long her departure might be
deferred, she must go at last, for her uncle's mandate
could not be disobheyed ; but gradually her eye became
fixed as in fascination. A single figure was emerging
from the trees, and dressed in theuniform of a mishap-
man-she was sure it was butit was a figure so tall, sa
slim, his step so lingering-it could not be Edward,
most likely some one of his messages, come to tell his
fate. He was taller even than Percy, but so much
slighter, so different to the boy for whom she had
parted, that, though her heart wounded and sunk till
faintness seemed to overpower her, she could not con-
vincc herself it was he. With an almost unconscious
effort she ran out, through the glass-door, to the steps of
the terrace; she could see him now distinctly, but not
his face, for is cap was low over his forehead; but as
he approached, he paused, as if doubting whether to go
up to the ill-door, or the well-known terrace, by which
he had always rushed into the schoolroom, on his daily
return from Mr. IIowuard's; and as he looked hastily up,
his cap fell back, and his eyes met Ellen's. A will but
checked scream broke from her lips, and all was an

impenetrable mist till she found herself in her brother's
arms, in the room she had quitted, his lips repeatedly
pressing her cheek and forehead, and his voice, which
sounded so strange-it did not seem like Edward's, it
was so much more deep and manly-entrcating her to
speak to him, and tell him why she looked so ill; but
still her heart so throbbed she could not speak. She
could only cling close to him and look intently in his
face, which was so altered from the happy, laughing
boy, that had he not been, from his extreme paleness
and attcnuation of feature, still more like their mother
when she was ill, his sister would scarcely have
known him.
 Dearest Ellen, do speak to me; what has been the
matter, that you look so pale and sad? Are you not
glad to see me?''

`And he? are you still within his power?'' inquired
Ellen, shrinking in terror from the expression of her
brother's face.
 No, Ellen, no; God forgive me-I have tried not to
rejoice; the death was so terrible, so nearly my own,
that I stood appalled, and, for the first time these two
years, knelt down to my God for pardon, mercy to
repent. The lightning struck him here he stood,
struck him beside me, leaving the withering smile of

CHAPTER VIII.
TIE STRUGGLE.
Mrs. IIALroN had been told at the lodge of her
nephew's arrival, and so powerful was her emotion, that
she leant back in the carriage, as it drove rapidly from
the lodge to the Hall, without the power of uttering a
word. Caroline was surprised, for his return seemed to
her only a cause of rejoicing;-she had no idea of the
mingled dread and joy, the trembling, lest Edward had
indeed deceived them all, and, if he had not, the
redoubled mystery of Ellen's conduct. While he was
absent she could think calmly on him as the cause of all,
but now that he was returned, her heart seemed to turn
sick with apprehension, and she had hardly strength to
inquire where he was, and great was her surprise when she
found his arrival was still unknown. Cnroline's joyful
exclamation, as she ran into the schoolroom to put
away some of her purchases, drew her there at once,
and for the first five minutes the intense thankfulness
that he was indeed safe and comparatively well,-that
whatever might be the secret change, his affection for
her, to judge by the warmth nd agitation of his
embrace, was unchanged, and she had that to work on,

alone occupied her mind and enabled her to regain her
calmness.
You lo, indeed, look as if you wanted English air
and home nursing, my dear boy,'' she said, after some
little time had elapsed, and Edward had seated himself
by her, his hand still clasped in hers;  Or Edward was
quite right to invalid you. kEmmeline does nothing but
talk of your wounds as making you a complete hero; I
am unromantic enough to wish that you had brought me
home more colour and more flesh, and less glory; but, I
suppose from being so pale, you are more like your poor
mother tan her;'' and she looked at him so earnestly,
that Edward's eyes, spite of all his efforts, sunk breath
hers. He answered gaily, however, and, in reply to
Caroline's numerous berries, entered into an animated
description of their voyage home and the causes of their
detention, in their being so often compelled to put into
port from the fearful storms they ad encountered, and
time slipped away so fast that the dinner-bell rung
before any one was prepared.
That Ellen should look paler than even when she had
left her in the morning, and be still more silent, did not
astonished Mrs. Ambition; the agitation of meeting her
brother was quite enough to occasion it; and she
advised her to remain quiet while they were at dinner,
that she might rcjoin them afterwards. She looked
as if she land been so very lately ill, that Edward was
not surprised at her having dined already; but many
little things that occurred during the evening-her ex-
essie quietness, the evident restraint between her and
Caroline, and he at first fancied, and then was quite her-

pain, between her and his aunt, startled and perplexed
him. She seemed restrained and shy, too, with him, as
if in constant terror. pOor child her aunt had advised
quietness while alone, and her mother's words rung i
her ears, till repose seemed farther off than her. After
all she had suffered before, and after the sending that
fatal letter, it had never reached him: she had utterly
failed in her attempt to save him. If she had, indeed,
confided at first in MRs. IIamilton, measures would have
been taken, she was sure, to ave secured him the
necessary relief, for whenever her uncle had sent him
his allowance it was through Sir Edward, not enough-
tearing the risk of the loss of a letter. There had been
times when, in the midst of her sufferings, Ellen could
realize a sort of comfort in the idea that she had saved
Edward and kept his secret; but where was this come-
fort now7 All she had endured, all she was still to
endure, was for nothing, worse than nothing; for if
ward knew her sin, feeling that it had brought
him no good, and given up, as she felt he must be,
to unrestrained passion, or he could not have given
vent to such fearful sentiments, she actually trembled
for its effect upon him and his anger on herself.
She had sometimes fancied that, perhaps, his errors
were not so great as he believed them, that he
would confess them when he fond only his kind
indulgent aunt at home, and so peace and hope
gradually dawn for both him and her. All her wish,
her hope now was, that MIss. IInmilton could be pro-

its cause or not, its effect on it would be so terrible,
that she felt any additional suffering to herself could
be better borne.
With these thoughts, no wonder she was silent, utterly
unable to subdue them as she wished, and evince natural
interest in all that had occurred to Edward; and tell him
all that had happened to herself during their long sea-
nation. Carolinc, however, was so animated; and when
Emmeline and Miss Harcourt returned, unable to come-
pretend what they could possibly be sent for, a full
hour earlier than usual, their astonishment and delight
at seeing Edward, prevented anything like a pause in
conversation, or unnatural restraint. His cousins found
so much to tell as well as to listen to, about Percy and
HErbert, as well as themselves; and Emmeline made
Edward tell her such minute particulars of their engage-
meets with the pirates, and how he was wounded, and
what Sir Edward said to him, that MIss. Milton,
anxious as she was-for the longer she was it her
nephew, the more convinced she was that he could not
meet her eye, and that is gaiety was not natural-she
could not help being amused in spite of herself.
Engrossed with thought how to arrive at the truth,
for which she so ardently longed, she entered the
library, when the prayer-bell rung, with her children ;
quite forgetting, till she had taken the place at the
reading-desk, which, in the absence of her husband
and sous, she always occupied herself, that she had
intended to desire Ellen to resume her usual place by
Emmeline, wishing to spare her any additional suffering

painful feeling on his part. It was an oversight, but
it vexed her exceedingly. She looked hastily round, in
the hope of being in time, hut Ellen was already in her
place, though she had evidently shrunk still more into
the recess of the lower window, as if longing for its
massive curtains to hide her, and her face was buried in
her hands. MRs. IInmilton would have been still more
grieved if she had sccn, as Well did, the beseeching
humble look, which as they entered Ellen had fixed
upon her, and that her pale lips had quivered with the
half-uttered supplication, which she failed in courage
fully to pronounce. Edward appeared too wrapt in his
own thoughts to notice it then; and as his aunt's
gently but impressive voice fell on his ear, the words,
the room, the whole scene so recalled the happy, and
comparatively innocent past, that it was with difficulty he
could restrain his feelings, till the attitude of kneeling
permitted them full went in tears, actual tears, when he
had thought he could never weep again. The contrast
of his past and present self, rendered the one more
brightly happy, the other more intensely dark than the
actual reality. The unchcckcd faults nd passions of
his early childhood had been the sole cause of his pre-
sent errors; but while under the gentle control of his
aunt and uncle and MIr. TOwards, he had not known these
faults, and, therefore, believed they had all come since.
DIe longed intensely to confide all his errors, all his
remorse, to MIr, TOwards, whom he still so dearly loved;
but he knew he had not courage to confess, and yet
hated himself for his cowardice.

even more than usually penetrating from anxiety), as
he arose, and became aware, for the first time, that
Ellen was not where he was accustomed to see her. He
kissed her only as she hurriedly approached im, but
perceiving she left the room with merely a faint good
night to the rest of the family, and no embrace, as
usual, from MIss. IInilton, he darted forwards, seized
his aunt's hand, and exclaimed-
 WhAt is the matter with Ellen, Aunt Emmelinel
VI is she so changed, and why is your manner to her
so cold and distant? and why did she kneel apart, as if
unworthy to join us even in prayers? Tell me, for pity's
sake'
 Not to-night, my dear Edward. It is a long tale
and a painful one, and I rely on you to help me, that
Ellen and myself may be again as we have been. It is
as much pain to me as to her that we are not. To.
morrow, I promise you, you shall know all. You have
had excitement enough for to-day, and after your ex-
hausting voyage must need rest. Do not fancy this an
evasion of your request; I have longed for your return
to influence Ellen, almost as much as for the happiness
of seeing you again.''
Edward was compelled to be satisfied and retire; but
though he did feel sufficient physical exhaustion, for the
comfort of his room to be unusually luxurious, his sleep
was restless and disturbed by frightful dreams, in which,
however cried the position, it always seemed that he
was in danger, and Ellen sncrificing herself to save
him.

On retiring for the night, Mrs. IIamilton discovered
a one on her dressing-table. She thought she knew
the writing, but from tremulousness it was so nearly
illegible, that it was with great difficulty she lecipherel
the following words:
I am so conscious I ought not to address you,
know so well that I have no right to ask any favour from
you, when I have given you so much trouble and pain,
that I could not have asked it, if you had not been a
very, very kind this morning. Oh Aunt Emmeline,
if indeed you can feel any pity for me, do not, pray.
do not tell Ward the real reason of my banishment
from Lowood; tell him I have been very wicked-
have refused to since any real repentance-but do not
tell him what I have done. He is ill, unhappy at
having to resign his profession even for a few months.
Oh l spare him the misery of knowing my sin. I know
I deserve nothing but severity from you-I lay no
right to ask this-but, oh if you have ever loved
me, do not refuse it. If you would but grant it, would
but say, before I go, that in time you ill forgive me,
it would be such comfort to the miserable-ELLEN,''
Mrs. Milton's eyes filled with tears; the word
`you'' had evidently been written originally, but par-
tially erased, and  the'' substituted in its stead, and she
could not read the utter desolation of one so young,
which that simple incident betrayed, without increase
of pain; yet to grant her request was impossible. It
puzzled her-for why should she so persist in the wish

expressed from the beginning that Edward should not
know it:' unless, indeed,-and her heart bounded with the
hope-that she feared it would urge him to confess him-
self the cause, and her sacrifice be useless. She locked up
the note, which she would not read again, fearing its deep
 humility, its earnest supplication, would turn her from
her purpose, and in praying fervently for guidance and
fitful sleep her night passed.
For some time after breakfast the following morning,
Edward and his aunt were alone together in the library.
It was with the utmost difficulty, he suppressed, suffi-
society to conceal, the fearful agitation which thrilled
through every nerve as he listened to the tale e ad
demanded. He could not doubt the use to which that
money had been applied. His sister's silence alone
would have confirmed it; but in that hour of madness,
--for what else is passion unrestrained by principle or
feeling -he was only conscious of anger, fierce anger
against the unhappy girl who had borne so much for
him. DIe had utterly forgotten the desperate words he
had written. DIe ad never received the intended relief.
STiLl within a week, a short week of his return, he had
been in Harding's power, and as Ellen's devotion had
saved him nothing, what could t wcigh against the
maddening conviction, that if he had one spark of
honour remaining, he st confess that he had caused
her sin? instead of saving, she had betrayed him; and
he left his aunt to seek Ellen, so evidently disturbed and
heated, and the interview itself had been so little satin-

as idulgently of error and difficulty as she could, with-
out betraying her strengthcned suspicions, that if she
had known how to do so, she would have forbidden his
seeing Ellen till he was more calm.
Unhappily, too, it was that part of the day when Else
was always most engaged, and she was not even in her
own room, so that there was no check on eDward's
violence. The control he lad cexcrcised while with his
aunt but increased passion when it was removed. DIe
poured forth the bitterest reproaches-asked how she
could dare hope relief so obtained, would ever he been
allowed to reach him?-what had she done but betrayed
him? for how could he be such an dishonoured coward
as to let her leave Oakwood because she would not
speak' and why had she not spoken-why not be-
tsnycd him at once, and not decoyed him home to
disgrace and misery? Passion had so maddened him,
that he neither knew what he said himself, nor heard
her imploring entreaties not to betray himself, and she
her would. She chng to his knees as she knelt be-
for him, for she was too powerless to stand, reiterating
her supplication in a tone that ought to have recalled
him to his better self, but the better self and been too
long silenced, and infuriated at her convulsive efforts to
detain him, he struck her with sufficient force to make
her, more by the agony of a blow from him, than the

arrived at one particular spot he knew not, for it was
one which of all others, in that moment of cxcite-
mcnt, he would gladly hae avoided. It was a
small glnde in the midst of the wood shelving down
to the water's edge, where he and Perry, with the
assistance of Robert, had en permitted to erect. a
miniature boat-house, and where Edward had kept a
complete ilotilla of tiny sessels. There were the trees,
the glad, the hot-house still, ay, and the vessels, in such
beautiful repair and keeping, that it brought back the
past so vividly, so overpowering, from the voiceless
proof, which it was, of the affectionate remembrance with
which he and his favourite tastes had been regarded,
been in his absence, that he could not bear it. He flung
himself full length on the greensward, and as thought
after thought came back upon him, bringing Ellen
before him, self-sacrificing, devoted, always interposing
between him and anger, as she had done from the first
hour they had been inmates of Onkwood, the thought
of that craven blow, those mad reproaches was in-
supportable; and he sobbed for nearly an hour in that
one spot, longing that some chance would but bring
MIr. FOrward to m, that he might relieve that fearful
remorse at once, but utterly unable to seek him of
himself.
Edward's disposition, like his mother's, was natural
much too good for the determined pursuit of evil. IIi
errors had actually been much less grave, than from
Harding' s artful representations he imagined them. DIe
never indulged in passion without its being followed by
the most agonizcd remorse; but from having certain-

ciously banished the religion which his aunt had so
tried to instil, and been taught by IIarding to scoff at
the only safe guide for youth, as for every age, God's
holy word, he had nothing whereon to lean, either as a
comfort in his remorse, a hope for amendmcnt, or
strength for self-conquest; and terrible indeed might
have been the consequences of GUarding's fatal influence,
if the influence of a home of love had not been still
stronger.
Two hours after he had quitted his aunt, he rejoined
the family, tranquil, but bearing such evident trees of
a mental struggle, at least so Mrs. Milton fancied,
for no one else notice it, that she still hoped she did
not exactly know what, for she failed in courage to ask
the issue of his interview with Ellen. She contcnted
herself with desiring Emmeline to tell her cousin to
bring her work or drawing, and join them, and she was
so surprised, when Emmeline brought back word that
Ellen had said she had much rather not, that she sought
her herself.
Ellen's cheeks, in general so pale, were crimson, her
eyes in consequence naturally brilliant, and she looked
altogether so unlike herself, that her aunt was more
anxious than ever; nor did her manner when asked why
she refused to join them, when Edward had so lately
returned, tend to decease the feeling.
 Emmeline did not say you desired it, or I should
have known better than to disobey,'' was her reply, and
it was scarcely lisrespectful; the tone seemed that of
spirit, crushed and goaded to the utmost, and so utterly
unable to contend more, though very here was quiver-

ing with pain. MRs. IIamilton felt bitter pain that
Ellen at length did indeed shrink from her; that the
disregard of her entreaty concerning her brother
appeared so to have wounded, that it had shaken the
affection which no other suffering had had power to
mock.
I do not desire it, Ellen, though I wish it,'' she
replied, mildly; ` you are of course at liberty to act as
you please, though I should have thought it most
natural that, not having been with Edward so long,
you should wish to be with him as much as possible
of he is at home.''
 DIe will not wish it; he hates me, spurns me, as I
knew he would, if he knew my sin To-day I was to
have gone to eldon Range; let me go at once then
neither he, nor you, nor any one need be tormented
with me any more, and you will all be happy again; let
me go, Aunt Emmeline, what should I stay to ?''
If you wish it, Ellen, you shall go next week. I
did not imagine that under any circumstances, you
could have expressed a desire to leave me, or suppose
that it would make me particularly happy to send you
away.''
 Why should it not you must hate me, too, or-or
you would not have refused the only-only favour I
asked you before I went,'' answered poor Ellen, and the
voice, which had been unnaturally clear, was choked
for the moment with sobs, which she resolutely forced
back. Mrs. Milton could scarcely hear it; taking
her ice-cold hands in both hers, she said, almost
tenderly-
168
SOmE INFLUENCE.
You ave reason to condemn me as harsh and cruel,
Ellen ; but time will perhaps explain the motives of my
conduct, as I trust and pray it will solve the mystery
of yours; you are not well enough to be left long alone,
and Well is so much engaged to-day that I do wish you
to be with me independent of your brother's society.
If you so much prefer remaining here, I will stay with
you, though of course, as Edward has been away from
us so long, I should wish to be with him also.''
It was almost the first time MIss. IIumilton had ever
had recourse in the management of her family to any-
thing that was not perfectly straightforward; and
though her present motives would have allowed much
deeper stratagems, her pure mind shrunk from her own
words. She wished Ellen to be constantly in Edward's
presence, that he might not be able to evade the impulse
of feeling and honour, which the sight of such suffering,
she thought must call forth; she could not bear to
enforce this wish as a command, when she had already
been, as she felt-if Ellen's silence were indeed self-devo-
lion, not guilt-so cruelly and so necessarily severe.
Ellen made neither reply nor resistance, but, taking up
her work, accompanied er and to the usual morning-
room, from which many a burst of happy laughter, and
joyous tones were echoing. Caroline and Declined
were so full of enjoyment at Ward's return, had so
many things to ask and tell, were so perfectly unsuspi-
pious as to his having any concern with his sister's full,
that if they did once or twice think him less lively and
joyous, than when he loft home, they attributed it

voyage and his wounds. Miss Harcourt, just as un-
suspicious, secretly accused eLlen as the cause of his
occasional abstraction: her conduct was not likely to
pass unfelt by one so upright, so honourable, and if he
had been harsh with her, as from Ellen's fearfully
drinking manner, and complete silence when they were
together, she fancied, she thought it was so deserved,
that she had no pity for her whatever.
The day passed briskly and happily enough, in seeming
to MRs. llamilton and Edward, in reality to all the other
member of the party-but one. The great subject of
regret was MIr. IIownrd's absence, he might be back at
the Rectory that evening, and Receive was sure he
would come to see Edward directly. As the hours
wanted, Ellen became sensible of a sharp and most un-
usual pain darting through her temples, and gradually
extending over her forehead and head, till she could
scarcely move her eyes. It had come at first so suddenly,
and lasting so short a time, that she could scarcely
define what it was, or why she should have felt so
suddenly sick and faint; but it increased, till there was
no difficulty in tracing it, and before prayer-time, had
become such fearful agony, that, if she had not been
inured to pain of all kinds, and endowed with extra-
ordinary fortitude and control, she must more than once
have betrayed it, by either giving way to faintness, or
screaming aloud. She had overheard Is. Milton

expect him every moment, and thought he would give
her something to relieve it, without her complaining.
INward had asked his cousins for some music, and
then, to please Emmeline, and sketched the order of
their engagement with the pirates, and o one noticed
her, for Mrs. milton's heart was sinking with dis-
appointed hope, as the hours passed, and there was no
sign to prove that her surmise was correct, and if it
were, that the truth would be obtained.
The prayer-bell rug, and as they rose, Edward's eyes,
for the first time since she had joined them, sought and
fixed themselves on his sister's face. Te paroxysm of
pain had for a few minutes subsided, as it had done
nlternately with violence all day, but it had left her a
ghastly pale, that he started in actual terror. It might
have been fancy, but i thought there was the trace of
his cowardly blow on her ple forehead, raised, and
black, and such a feeling of agony and remorse rushed
over him, that it was with difficulty he restrained him-
self from catching her in his arms, and beseeching her
forgiveness before them all; but there was no time
then, and they proceeded to the library. Every step
Ellen took appeared to bring back that fearful pain,
till as she sat down, and then knelt in her place, she
was sensible of nothing else.
The service was over; and as MRs. Milton rose
from the private prayer, with which each individual

very moment it turned sick and faint with terror.
Several of the. lower domestic had quitted the library
before Edward regained voice, and his first word, or
rather action, was to desire those that remained to stay.
 MIr sister has been disgraced, exposed before you
all,'' he exclaimed, in a tone of misery and determina-
lion, that so startled MIss lIarcourt and lis cousins,
they gazed at him bewildered, `and before you all
must be her esculpation. It was less for her sin than her
silence, and for the increased guilt while that appeared
to conceal, you tell me, she has been so severely treated.
Aunt Emmeline, I am the cause of her silence-I was
lie tepter to her sin-I hae deceived my commander,

For a full minute after these unexpected, startling
words there was silence, for none could speak, not even
Emmeline, whose first thought was only joy, that
Ellen's silence was not so guilty as it seemed. Edward
had crossed his arms on the reading-desk, and buried
his face upon them. The instantaneous change of sent-

those most prejudiced can scarcely be described ; but

which clasped the burning forehead, as if their rooted
pressure could alone still that agonizing pain, `my

Ellen clasped her hands from her forehead, and
looked up in MRs. Milton's face. Her lips moved as
if to speak, but in a moment an expression of agony
flitted over her face, a cry broke from her of such
fearful physical pain, that it thrilled through the hearts
of all who heard, and consciousness deserted her at the
same moment, that Mr. MInitland and MIr. Towards,
entered the room together.

CHAPTER I.
ILLNESS3 AND REMORSE.
173
It was indeed a fearful night will followed the close
of our last chapter. Illness, sufficient to occasion
anxiety, both in Herbert and Ellen, had been often an
inmate of Oakwood, but it had merely called for care,
and all those kindly smpathies, which render indisposi-
lion sometimes an actual blessing, both to those who
suffer and those who tell. But illness, appearing to
be but the ghastly vehicle of death, clothed in such fear-
ful pain, that no control, men of reason and strong will,
can check its agonized expression, till at last, reason
itself success beneath it, and bears the mind from the
tortured frame, this is a trial of no ordinary suffering,
been hen such illness has been brought about b what
may be termed natural causes. But when it follows, nay,
springs from mental anguish, when the sad watchers
feel that it might lapse been averted, that it is the con-
sequence of mistaken treatment, and it comes to the
young, to whom such sorrow ought to be a thing un-
known, was it marvel that Mrs. Milton, as she
stood by Ellen's bed, watching the alternations of death-
like insensibility, with paroxysms of pain, which nothing
could relief (for it was only the commencement of brain

foeer), felt as if she had indeed never known grief or
anxiety before. She had looked forward to Edward's con-
passion bringing hope and rest to all; that the aching
hand and strained nerves of her poor Ellen, only needed
returning love, and the quickness of assured forgiveness
for herself and Edward, for health and happiness gradu-
ally to return; and the shock of such sudden and terrible
illness, betraying, as it did, an extent of previous mental
suffering, which she had not conceived as possible in
one so young, almost unnerved her. But hers was not
a character to give way; the anguish she experienced
might be rend in the almost stern quiet of her face, in
her gentle but firm resistance to every persuasion to
move from Ellen's bed, not only through that dreadful
ight, but for the week which followed. The idea of
death was absolute agony; none but her God knew the
struggle, day after says, night after night, which slc
endured, to compel her rebellious spirit to submission to
IIi ill, whatever it might be. She knew earth's
dearest, most unalloyed happiness could not compare
with that of HEaven, if indeed it should he lIVes pleasure to
recall her; bitter thought would not bring peace. She
had no reason to reproach herself, for she had acted only
as imperativc duty demanded, and it had caused her
almost as much misery as Ellen. but yet the thought
would not leave her, that her harshness and cruelty had
caused all the suffering she beheld. She did not utter
those thoughtsaloud, she did not care give words to that
deep wretchedness, for she felt her only sustaining
strength was in her God. The only one who would

comfort, without a word fro her, her husband, was
far away, and she dared not sink; though there were
times when heart and frame felt so utterly exhausted, it
seemed as if she rust.
MIr. TOwards's presence al been an inexpressible re-

Not understanding her, except that Edward must be
naturally grieved at his sister's illness, MIr. ONward
sought him, and found him still in the library, almost
 in the same spot.
This is a sad welcome for you, Edward,'' he said,
kindly laying his hand on his shoulder, "`but do not be
touched cast down. Ellen is veryyoung, her constitution
MIr. Maitland assure us is good, and she may be spared
us yet. I came or on purpose to see you, for late as
it was when I returned from Esther, and found you had
]arrived, I could not defer it till to-morrow.''
]You thought you came to see the pupil you so loved,''
]answered Edward, raising his head, and startling MIr
Howard, both by his tone and countenance.  You do
not know that I am the cause of my poor sister's suffer-
ing, that if she dies, I am her murderer. Oh, Mr.

myself.''
Startled as ice was, MIr. IIownrd, well acquainted with
the human heart, its crrors, as well as its better impulses,
know how to answer this passionate appeal, so as to knit
its full conlidenceaud soothe at the same time. eDward
poured out his whole tale. It is needless to enter upon
it here in detail; suffice it, that the artful influence of
GUarding, by gradually determining the good prices-
signs of the home he had left, had prepared his pupil for an
unlimited indulgence in pleasure, and excitement,at eery
opportunity which offered. And as the pRince William
was rising off the coast of British America, and con-
instant touching at one or other of her poets, where
Harding, from lis seniority and usefulness, and eDward,
from his invariahle good conduct, were often permitted
to go ashore, these opportunities, especially when they
were looked for and see by one practised in deceit and
wickedness, were often found. It does not require a long
period to initiate in gambling. The very compelled re-
strain, in the intervals of its indulgence, but increased its
maddening cxcitcmcnt, and once given up to its blind
pursuit, Leading became more than ever necessary to
Edward, and of course is power over him increased.
But when i tried to make him a sharer and consider
in his own low pleasures, to teach him vice, cautiously
as he thought had worked, he failed; Inward started
back appalled, and though unhappily he could not break
from it, from that hour he misdoubtcd and shrank
away. But he had given an advantage to his fell tutor,
the extent of which he knew not himself. IIarding was

too well versed in art to betray disappointment. DIe
knew when to bring wine to the billiard-table, so to create
such a delirium of excitement, that Edward was wholly
unconscious of his own actions; and once or twice, he
led him into scenes, and made him sharer of such
vicious pleasures, that secured him as his slave; for when
the excitement was over, the agony of remorse, the
misery, lest his confiding captain should suspect him
other than he seemed, made him cling to FInding's
promises of secrecy, as his only refuge, even while he
loathed the man himself. It was easy to make such a
disposition believe that he had, in some moment of ex-
excitement, done something which, if known, wouldecpel
in the Any; Edward could never recall what, but he
beliesrel him, and became desperate. Harding told him
it was downright folly to think about it so seriously. It
was only known to him, and he would not betray him.
But Edward writhed beneath his power; perpetually he
called on him for pecuniary help, and when he had
none, told him he must write home for it, or in it at
the billiard-table, or he knew the consequences; and
Edward, though again and again he had resolved he
would not touch a ball or cut, (and the remorse had
been such, that he would no doubt have kept the
solemn, had it not been for dread of betrayal,) rather
than write home, would madly seek the first opportunity,
and play, and win perhaps enough, all but few pounds,
to satisfy his tormentor, and for these he would appeal
to his sister, and receive them as we know; ever ask
ing, nd so never hearing, the heavy price of individual
suffering at which they were obtained.

The seven or eight months which had clasped before
his last fatal appeal, had been oeeasioned by the ship
being out at sea. Sir Edward had mentioned to Mr.
IIanilton, that Edward's excellent conduct on board
had given him n longer holiday on share, when they
were off New York, to which place he had been de-
snatched on business to the Prcsident, than most of his
companions. Edward thought himself safe, for
Harding had been unusually quiet, but the very day
they neared land, he told him he must have some cash,
sneered at the trifling sum Edward lad by him, toll him
if he close to let him try for it fairly, they should have
a chance at billinrds for it; but if that failed, he must
pump his rich relations for it, for have it he must.
Trusting to his luck, for he had often won, even with
Harding, he rushed to the table, played, and as might
be expected, left off, owing his tormentor fifty pounds.
Harding's friends triumph, and his declaration that he
must trouble him for a cheque to that amount, signed
by the great millionuaire, Arthur Hnruilton, Esq., goaded
him to madness. He drank down a large draught of
brandy, and deliberately sought another table and
another opponent, nd won back fifteen: but it was
the last day of his stay on shore, as his slavery knew,
and it was the wretchedness, the misery of this heavy
left to the twenty merciless betrayed of his youthful
freshness and innocence, who had solemnly sworn if he
did not pay it by the next letters from his home, he
would inform against him, and he knew the conse-
quences, which had urged that fearful letter to Ellen,
from which all her suffering had sprung. Edward was

much too young and ignorant of the world's ways to
know that IIarding no more dared execute his threat
against him, than he could put his own head in the
lion's mouth, His remorse was too deep, his nothing
of his changed self too unfeigned, to believe that his
errors were not of the serious, fatal nature which
Harding taught him to suppose them; and the anguish
of a natural fine, noble, independent spirit may be
imagined. ALl his poor mother's lessons of his uncle's
excessie sternness, and determined pitilessness, towards
the faults of those less firm, and worthy than himself
returned to him, completely banishing his own power-
ances of that same uncle's excessive kindness. The one
feeling had been insensibly installed in his boyhood,
from as long as he could remember, till the age of
tell; the other was but the experience of eighteen
short months. Oh, if parents would but think and
tremble at the last importance of the first lessons which

There was much in the end tale he had heard to gie
hope, and Mr. TOwards longed to impart its comfort to
MRs. Milton; but he felt she could not listen. While
day after day passed, and the poor sufferer for another's
erros lay hoering between life and death, reason s
utterly suspended, that even when the violent agony of
the first seven days and nights had subsides into
lethargic stupor, alternating with such quiet submission
and gentle words, that, had it not been for their wander-
ing sense, one might have fancied intellect returning:
still reason was absent-and, though none said it aloud,
the fear would gain dominion that health might return
but not the mind. The first advice had been procured;-
what was distance, even then, to wealth-every reed
resorted to. Her luxuriant hair cut close, and ice itself
applied to cool that burning tlrobbing pain; but all
had seemed ain, till its cessation, at the end of seven
days, somewhat renewed Mr, MIaitland's hope.
Not one tear had MRs. Milton shed, and so exces-
give had been her fatigue, that Miss Harcourt and her
children trembled for her; conjuring her, for their
sakes, for her husband's, to take repose. MIr. Initland's
argument, that when Ellen recovered her senses, (which
he assured her now he had little doubt she would

presence still more than she could then, and her

of trial, which Mrs. Milton fully rcenlized, when Ellen's
convalescence permitted her to recall it, though at the
time it sccmcd unnoticed. That Caroline's strong mind
and good heart, should urge her to do everything in her
power to save her mother trouble, even to entreat WIlliam
and MOrris to show her, and let her attend to the weekly
duties with them, and accomplish them so carucestly
and well, that both these faithful domestic were
astonished and delighted, was not surprising: for hers
was a character to display its better qualities in such
cmergencies. ut that Decline should so effectually
house herself from the overwhelming grief, which had at
first assailed her at Ellen's fearful sufferings and great

And she did devote herself to Edward, and so success-
full-with her gentle sympathy with his grief, her
tender feeling towards his faults, her conviction of her
father's forgiveness, her unassumig but heart-breathing
pity, which ithout one word unduly introduced of a
subject so holy, for she felt herself much too lowly and
ignorant to approach it,-yet always led up his thoughts
to God, and from one so young, so humble, and, in
general, so joyous, had still greater effect in confirming
his returning religious hope, than had his teachers been
only those who were older and wiser than himself.
HOwever miserable he might be before she came, he
looked to her society, her eloquence, as comfort and
hope; and soon perceiving this, she was encouraged to
go on, though quite astonished-for she could not
imagine what she had done to deserve such commenda-
lion-when MIr. Howard, one day meeting her alone,
took both her hands in his, and with even unusual
fervour bade God bless her-for young, lowly, as she
was, she not only comforted the erring, but raised and
strengthened the penitent's trembling faith and hope.

sufferings, she did not think for a moment, that he could
imagine her never referring to his confession, originate
in displeasure.
Ton or twelve days had so passed, when one after-
noon, completely exhausted its two nights' wntchful-
ness-for though Nurse ILangford and Fancy were in
constant attendance on Ellen, she could not rest if she
heard that throwing cry for her, even thongl her pre-
sence brought no comfort,-she act to lie down
for a few hours on a couch in her dressing-room.
Cnroline had taken a book, though with not much in-
relation to read, to sit by her, and watch that her
sleep should not be disturbed. How, in those moments
of quiet did she long for her father feeling intuitively
how much heavier was her mother's trial without his
loud support. He had been written to by them all
since Edward's confession. MRs. llamilton had done
so in Ellen's room, only to beseech him to write for-
giving, forbearing, to the unhappy cause of all. She
did not dare breathe her feelings, even on paper, to him,
convinced that if she did so, control must give way, and
she was powerless at once; but her husband knew her
so well, that every suppression of individual emotion
betrayed more forcibly than the most earnest words, all
she was enduring.
Caroline lad kept her affectionate vigil nearly two
hours, when Edward's voice whispered,  MIss IIarceourt

be quite as watclful as yourself; only let me stay here,

possible. She left him, and Edward, drawing a low
stool to the foot of the couch, as if not daring to occupy
his cousin's seat, which was close by the pillow, gazed
on the mild gentle features of his aunt, as in their deep
repose they showed still clearer the traces of anxiety and
sorrow, and felt more keenly than ever the full amount
of misery, which his errors and their fatal concealment
had created.  Why is it,'' he thought, ` that man
cannot bear the punishment of his faults without causing
the innocent, the good, to suffer also?'' And is heart
seemed to answer, ` Because by those very social ties, the
strong impulses of love for one another, which would
save others from woe, we may be preserved and
redeemed from vice again and yet again, when, were
man alone the sufferer, vice would he stronger than
remorse, and never be redeemed,''
Mrs. IIamilton woke with that painful start which long
watchfulness always occasions, and missing Caroline,
yet feeling as if she were not alone, her eyes speedily
stood themselves in some surprise on the figure of her
nephew, who, unable to bear the thoughts the sight of
her exhaustion produced, and bent his head upon the
couch. Inexpressibly touched, and glad of the door-
tunity to speak to him alone, she called him to her, and
there was something in the tone that encouraged him to
fling himself on his knees by her side, and so like an
infant, saying, almost inarticulate-

line? Your silence has almost broken my heart, for it
seemed to say you never could; and when I look at my

in sending relief to you, she might be exsposing herself
to inconvenience or displeasure? Was there no scorn-
deration due to her?'
I never seemed to think of her, except as glad and
willing to help me, at whatever cost to herself,'' was
his reply. :I feel now the cruel selfishness of the belief
-but, oh, Aunt Emmeline, it was fostered in me from
my earliest childhood, grew with my growth, increased

know all my poor sister's neck and gentle worth, and it
makes me still more miserable. I never could think her

had become inmates of Oakwood Ellen lad constantly

Ellen's childish character, and none more so than the
disobedience which e related in our second part,
and which Edward's avowal of having himself moved

too, tlt MIr. World had thought it necessary, for
Ellen's perfect justification, to examine her letters and
papers, hut that all his appeals to her had been destroyed
but one-his last fatal enclosure, the exact contents of
which he had so utterly forgotten, written, as they were
in a moment of madness, that he shuddered himself as
he read it. He placed the paper in MRs. Milton's
hand, conjuring her not to recall her forgiveness when
she rend it; but she must see it, it was the only amends
he could make his poor ellen, to ejaculate her fully.
Was it any wonder it had almost dried her wild? or
that she should have scarcely known the means she
adopted to send him the relief, with, as he deserved,

thought rose to her mind, connecting, dining, explain-
ing eLlen's conduct from her sixteenth birthday, the day
she received it, to the discovery of her sin, and her
devoted silence afterwards, trifling incidents which she
had forgotten returned to all their weight of evidence,
and increase almost to agony her self-reproach, for not
seeing the whole before, and acting differently. She
remembered now Ellen's procrastination in writing to
Edward, the illness which followed, and could well
understand her dread lest the finding the notes should
be traced to that day, and so throw a suspicion on her
brother, and her consequent firmness in refusing to state
the day she had found them.
That long interview was one of inexpressible comfort
to Edward; but though his unfeigned repentance and
full confession gave his aunt hope for him, it did but
increase her individual trial, as she returned to Ellen's
couch and listened to wanderings only too painfully ex-
pained by the tale she had heard.

INSTANT IMPRESSIONS ERADICATED.

It was the seventeen day of Ellen's illness, and for
six and thirty hours she had slept profoundly, waking
only a very long intervals, just sufficiently to swallow
a few drops of port wine, which Mr. MInitlnnd had
ordered to be administered if she woke, and sunk
to sleep again. It was that deep, still, almost fearful
repose, for it is so like death, which we can scarcely
satisfy ourselves is life, except by holding a glass at
intervals to the lips, to trace if indeed it receive the
moisture of the great. And Nurse Languor, MRs.
Milton, and Edward had, through these long hours,
touched and scarcely stirred. For they knew that on
her waking hung hope or misery, return of intellect,
or its confirmned suspension. MIr. MIaitland had par-
ticularly wished Edward to be with her when she free-
vexed her senses, that his presence might seem as
natural as either of her cousins; but he warned him that
the least display of agitation on his part, or reference
to the past, in her exhausted state, might be fatal to
her. It was quite the evening. Widow Languor ad

to breathe freely, from the intensity of her hope that
ellen would recover. And if such were her feelings,
what were eDward's and MIss. IIamilton's? The former
was kneeling on the right of the bed, his eyes alter-
lately fixed on his sister, and tried in the core-
lid. MRs. lIamilton was on the opposite side, close to
Ellen's pillow, the curtain draw so far back, that the
least church on her patient's countenance was discern-
able. HOur after hour had so passed, the chimes that
told their flight scarcely heard by those anxious wntchers.
It was about eight o'clock, when a slight movement in
Ellen made her aunt's heart so throb, as almost to
deprive her of breath; her eyes unclosed, and a smile,
such as Mrs. IIamilton had not seen for weeks, nay
months, circled her lips.
 Dear Aunt, have i been ill? It seems such a long, long
time since l hae seen you, and my head feels so strange,
so light; and this room, it is my own, I know, but I
feel as if it did not belong to me somehow. Do make
my head clear, I cannot think at all.''
Do not try to think yet, ring. You late been
very, very ill, and to endeavour to think might hurt
you. Strength will soon return now, I hope, and then
your head will be quite clear again,'' replied Mrs.
IIamilton, quietly and caressingly, though she so
trembled with the change from sickening dread to her-
vain hope, that she herself scarcely knew how she spoke
at all.
 But what made me so ill, Anne? I feel as if it were
some great pain; I cannot remember anything clearly,
but yet it seems as if I had been very unhappy,-and

That I did not love you, my Ellen indeed, that was
only fancy. You ere very unhappy, as we were all,
for Edward did not come as soon as i expected him,
and the storms were very dreadful, and we feared his
ship might bare been recked, or cast ashore, some-

given him a sad welcome, but you must make up for

Ellen looked languidly, yet eagerly round, as her
aunt spoke, and her gaze fixed itself on her brother, who
was struggling violently to suppress the emotion, which
at the sound of her voice, in connected words, near
overpowerel him; and still more so,- when Ellen said,
more eagerly that she had yet spoken.-
 Dear Edward. come and kiss me, and do not look
so sad. I shall soon get well,''
He bent over her, and kissed her repeatedly, trying
in ain to say something,, but he felt so choked, ho

to desire the vague thoughts and memories which seemed

not take a distinct form. IVor eye wandered from him
for a moment to Nurse ILangford, who had come to the
foot of the bed, and that seemed another face connected
with the blank past, and then it fixed itself again on
Ward, and her pale face so worked with the colour
of thought, that MIss. milton became alarmed. She
saw too that Edward was growing paler and paler,
and trembled for the continuance of his control. Taking
Ellen's hand gently from his, and arranging her pillow
at the same time, so as to turn her face rather from him,
she said, playfully-
 You have looked at Edward long enough, Ellen, to
be quite sure he is safe at home. So now I shall be
jealous if you give him any more of your attention and
neglect me; you must take some nourislment, and try
to go to sleep again, for I must not have you try your
strength too much.''
If I could but remember clearly,'' answered Ellen,
sadly; ' it is all so vague-so dark-but I do not think
it was only because i did not come, that made me so
unhappy.''
 You are not going to be disobedient, dearest,''
replied Mrs. Milton, firmly, though fondly, as she
hastily signed to edward to leave the room, which he
most thankfully did, never stopping till he reigned his
own, and tried to thank God for IIi great mercy, but
could only sob. :I told you not to think, because to
do so might retard return of strength, and indeed you
must try and obeyed; you know Am very peremtory
sometimes,'' And the fond kiss with which she enforeed
the command seemed to satisfy Ellen, whose natural

193
submissiveness, combined with excessive physical went-
ness, caused her to obey at once, and not attempt to think
any more. She took the required nourishment with
returning appetite, and soon afterwards fell quietly and
apply to sleep again, her aunt's hand closely clasped
. in hers.
From that day, all fear of disordered intellect de-
parted, and gradually the extreme exhaustion gave way
before MIr. MIaitland's judicious treatment. Strength,
indeed, returned so slowly and almost imperceptibly,
that it was necessary to count improvement by weeks,
not days. And when, i weeks after her first seizure,
she was thought well enough to be carried to MRs.
MIlton's dressing-room, and laid on a couch there,
it was a source of gratitude and rejoicing to all. But
MIr. MIaitland and MRs. Milton soon saw, and with
intense anxiety, that with the physical strength memory
and thought had not fully returned, and that their
consequence was a depression so deep, as effectually
to retard her perfect recoery. She seemed to shrink
from all attention, all kindness, as utterly unleserved,
even from er cousins. She would look at Edward
for half an hour together, with an expression of sun-
fearing, that made the heart actually ache. At times
she would receive MRs. IIamilton's caressing and judi-
pious tenderness as if it were her only comfort, at
others, shrink from it, as if she had no right to it.
This will never do,'' M. Maitland said, about ten
days after Ellen's removal into her daily quarters, and
finding she was losing ground; `` there is something

so, you refer to the past. She remembers it all too
clearly I fear, so our not alluding to it does no good.
You must be the physician in this case, my dear MIss.
Ambition, for I am powerless.''
But though she quite agreed with him, how to
approach such a very painful subject required no little
consideration, but, as is very often the case, chance does
that on which we have expended so much thought.
One afternoon Ellen lay so still, so pale, on her
couch, that MIss. IlIamilton bent over her to listen if she
breathed, saying, as she did so, almost unconsciously-
 My poor Ellen, when shall I have the comfort of
seeing you well and happy again 2''
Ellen hastily unclosed her eyes, for she was not asleep,
-it had been only the stupor of painfully-cngrossing
thought, rendering her insensible to all outward things,

you could not have known or thought of anything,
but that relief seemed sent to our hand-had it

to give him the aid he demanded, and never have been

such an act, how could yo hae borne it, if it had con-

day, when you can look back more calmly on the last
few months, you will acknowledge with me, that great
as your suffering have been, they were sent in love, both
to him and to you.''
If they have saved him-saved him from a point-

Ellen did try to smile, but she was too weak to bear
this complete removal of a double burden without an
emotion that seemed more like pain than joy. She
Said her head on her aunt's shoulder, and wept without
restraint. They were the first tears she and shed since
her illness, and Mrs. IIamilton thanked God for them.
She did not attempt to check them, but the few words
she did speak told such affectionate sympathy, such
perfect comprehension of that young heart, that Ellen
felt as if a mountain of lend were dissolving from her.
'And now, my Ellen, that I have relieved you of a
painful dread, will you case my mind of a great
anxiety ?'' inquired Mrs. Milton, nearly an hour after-
wards, when Ellen seemed so relieved and called, that she
could talk to her without fear. `' You look surprised;
but it is a subject you alone can explain, and till it is

Tell me, when and how it was taken; and I think I can
prove to you that your poor mother would have re-
called it, had she had the least idea of the solemn hold
it had taken upon you.''
Thus encouraged, Ellen narratcd the scene that had
taken place in Widow Organ's cottage just before
Mrs. Milton arrived; and her mother's fears for
Edward, and dread of MIr. Milton, which it was very
evident, and now more than ever, had extended to both
her children. She said that Mr. Martin's assurance,
that her mother could see, and would love her in

Oakwood before it made her very unhappy, from its con-
stand interference with, and revelation of, her obedience
and duty to her aunt; that it had often caused her violent
headache, only from her vain attempts to satisfy herself
as to that which she ought to do. When Edward first
 went to sea, and all seemed so right and happy with
him, of course she became happier than she had ever
been before. Then came his difficulties, and her con-
fiction that she must save him and keep his secret.
That her reason and her affection often urged her to con-
fide all to her aunt, certain that she would not harshly
condemn Edward, but would forgive, and help him far
more effectually than she could; but she dared not, for
whenever she thought thus the figure of her mother
rose before her, seeming to reproach and threaten her
for exposing the child she so dear led to disgrace
and ruin; and this was so vivid-so constant-during
his last appeal, that she thought she must be going
mad; that nothing but the dread of not being firm
enough to keep Edward's secret, had withheld her from
confessing her sin at once to her aunt, especially when
her uncle had so solemnly denouncel it as theft, and
that when it was discovered it seemed actual relief,
though it brought such severe punishment, for she
knew no suffering for her could be too severe.
The tale, as Ellen told it, was brief and simple enough,
and that there was any merit in such a system of
self-devotion never seemed to enter her mind for a
moment; but to Mrs. IInmilton it revealed such an
amount of suffering and trial, such a quiet, systematic,
heroic endurance, that she unconsciously drew that
young delicate being closer and closer to her, as if her

love should protect her in future from any such trial;-
and from what had it all sprung ' the misery of years,
at a period when life should be so joyous and so free,
that care and sorrow lace it as too purely and too briefly
happy to approach? From a few thoughtless words,
from a thoughtless partial mother, whose neglect and
dislike had pronounced that disposition cold, unloving
and inanimate whose nature was so fervid, so imagine-
tie, that the utmost care should have been taken to
prevent the entrance of a single thought or feeling too
preeocious, too solemn for her years. It may be urged,
and with truth, that to an ordinary child the promise
might have been forgotten, or hopelessly laid aside,
without any harm according from it, but it was from
not caring to know the only character of the little
being, for whose happiness and virtue she was re-
possible, that the whole mischief sprung; and it is
this neglect of maternal duty, against which we would
so earnestly warn those who may not have thought about
it. It is not enough to educate the mind, to provide
bodily necessaries, to be indulgent in the gift of pleasure
and amusement, the heart must be won and taught;
and to do so with any love of success, the character
must be transparent as the day: and what difficulty,
what hindernnce, can there or ought there to be in of-
training this important knowledge to a mother, from
whose breast the babe has received its nourishment,
from whose arms it has gradually slipped away to feel
its own independence, from whose lips it has received
its first lessons, at whose once lisped its first prayer

 BUt how can she, if they are not all equally de-

Ellen's earnest face, on which joy and hope seemed
struggling with doubt, was sufficient answer.
All mothers do not think of their solemn response-

have tended to waken your mother's consciousness of
her duty, and so, without any fault in yourself, my
Ellen, hae occasioned her too great partiality for
Edward. But do you remember her last words ?''
Ellen did remember them, and acknowledged they
had so increased her affection for her mother, as to
render the promise still more sacred to her.
I feared so, dearest; but it is just the contrary effect
which they should have had. When she called on to her,
and blessed and kissed you as fondly as she did Edward,
she said she had done you injustice, had failed in her
duty to you, and it so grieved her, for it was too late
to atone for it then; she could only pray to God to raise
you up a kinder parent. I hae trielto be that, for her

Ellen's tears were falling fast and freely, but they
were hardly tears of pain. lIe aunt's words seemed
to disperse a thick mist from her brain and heart, and
for the first time, to satisfy her that she might dismiss the
painful memory of her promise, and dismiss it without
blame or disobedience to her mother.
MRs. IIamilton had begun the conversation in them-
being, for it seemed so difficult to accomplish her object
without undue condemnation of her sister; but as eLlen,
clasping her arms about her neck, tried to think her

just the same, and she would try to guard him and her-
self from doing long, that lcr mother should love her

actually diseased. It was not at all surprising; for much
older and stronger and wiser persons would have kept-
experience the same, under the same pressure of grief,
and terror and remorse. But what can I do to cure
this morbid imagination, Ellen?'' she continued, play-
fully ; ` sentence you, as soon as to get well, to a
course of rathematics, six hours each day ?''
i am afraid my poor hand will be more stupid at
figures than ever,'' replied Ellen, trying to smile too.
 Then I suppose I not think of something else.
Will you follow Emmeline's example, and tell me every-
thing, however foolish or founded it may seem, that
comes into this little head-whether it worries or pleases
you? You have nothing, and you will have nothing

and if you will do this, you will give me more comfort
indiidually, and more security for the furtherance of
your happiness, as far as my love can promote it, than
any other plan.''
GIrl playfulness had given place to renewed earnest-
ness, and Ellen, as if in the very thought of such perfect
confidence dwelt security and peace, so long unknown
other, gave the required assurance so eagerly and grate-
fully, that Mrs. IIamilton was satisfied and happy.

imagine what could so have altered their feelings towards
her, but with that evident gratitude and pleasure which
encourages a continuance of kindness. Emmeline was
always kind, but it was indeed happiness to feel she might
talk with and share her amusements, as in former days;
and that, instead of thinking she ought not to receive
her aunt's affection, the only thing she asked in return
was her full confidence. The inexpressible rest to poor
Ellen which that conversation gave is not to be describe.
It was so blessed, so soothing, that it seemed too un-
natural to last, and the secret dread thither uncle would
not feel towards her and eDward as her aunt did was its
only alloy. Edward, too, was cheerful, and almost

having as soon as she was strong enough, to remove the
false impressions which his severity had given, and
with never ceased to grieve and reproach him, caused
his almost daily visits to be anticipated by her with as
much gladness as they had before brought dread.
`And now that anxiety for ellen is at and, I must

Oakwood had resumed its regular happy aspect, though
Ellen was still upstairs. Morris and Lips had once more
the happiness of their beloved mistress's superintendence,
and proud were they both, as if Caroline had been their
own child, to show all she had done, and so unostenta-
tiously, to save her mother trouble, when she had been
too anxious to think of anything but Ellen; and the
mother's heart swelled with a delicious feeling of grate-
rude to Him who, if in making her so acutely sensible

of her children, for the young men had evidently grown
anxious on the subject too. It was not likely that the

crew of the hapless Seen quickly deserted her. Captain
Have was the last to descend, and, as he did so, a block
of iron, loosened from its place, fell cornerwise, and struck
sharply on Edward's forehead, almost stunning him for
the moment, as he watched the captain's descent. He
felt the blood slowly trickling down his temple and
cheek; but he was not one to be daunted by pain: he
resumed his station at the helm in unbroken silence,
only speaking when directions were absolutely necessary,
and the only in a few brief sailor-terms. They had
scarcely proceeded a third of their way, when the waters
boiled and foamed as tossed by some strange whirlpools,
and it required all Edward's address and skill as steers-
man to prevent the frail boat from being drawn into
the other. The case was soon displayed, and every
heart shuddered, for ten minutes later, and help would
indeed have been in vain. 1he unfortunate vessel had
sunk-been swallowed up in those rushing waters; the
suction of so large a mass, producing for a brief interval
the effect of a whirlpool. The silence of awe and of
intense thankfulness, fell on the heart of every man,
and more than all on his, who had so far recovered his
first emotion as to gaze wonderingly and adriringly on
the boyish figure at the helm, whose voice was utterly
unknown, and those features the fitful light, and the
youth's stedfast gaze on his rowers, prevented his
tracing with any certainty.
The crowds had increased on the shore, watching
with intense eagerness the return of the boat; but the

portentous reigned. A huge sea had concealed her for
several minutes, and Mr. Howard, who during these
two long hours had remained spell-bound on the beach,
groaned alone in his agony; again she was visible,
driven on with fearful elocity by the tide, nearer, nearer
still. DIe thought he could distinguish the figure of his
friend: he was sure he could hear the voice of Edward,
urgiug, comanding, directing a landing somewhere, in
contradiction to the opinion of others. They were
within a dozen yards of the shore, but still not a sound
of gratulation was heard. Every eye was fed, as in
the fascination of terror, on a wave in the distance, in-
ereasing in size and fury as it rapidly approached. It
asked the boat-it stood impending over the frail thing
as a mighty avalanche of waters-it burst; the boat
was seen no longer, and a wild and terrible cry sounded
far and near along the beach

OREBODINGS.
ThE whole of the day MRs. IIamilton had vainly tried to
shake off most unwonted gloom. Convinced herself
that it was greatly physical, from the unusual oppressive-
ness of the weather relaxing the years, which had so
many months been overstrained, yet her thoughts
would cling to MIr. MIaitland's words, that her husband
might be coming home himself; but if the accounts of
Ellen's danger and edward's confession had recalled
him, he ought to hae arrived full two or three weeks
previous. The gale that swept round her, the awful
and unnatural darkness-the remarkable phenomcna at
that season of lightning-and the long loud thunder-

from the gale, appallel the whole household; and there-

tempest, should become in that fearful anxiety almost a
certainty of agony. It was well, perhaps, that her un-
selfish nature had an object to draw her in some slight
degree out of herself, for er firmness, her trust beyond
the accidents of earth, all seemed about to fail her, and
make her for the time being most wretched. As the
storm and closeness increased, so did Ellen's feverish
restlessness: her nerves, not yet full restored, felt
strung almost to torture, with every flash and clap and
blast. She tried to laugh at her own folly, for though
often terrified when a little child at the storms in India,
those of England had never affected her at all, and she
could not understand why she should feel this so child-
she. But argument is of little moment in such cases;
and MRs. Milton, satisfying her that she could no
more help her present sensation than her physical
weakness, tried to soothe and amuse her, and in so
doing partially cheered herself. She did not leave her
till past midnight, and then desiring Mrs. Languor to
sit up with her till she was comfortably asleep, retired to
her own bedroom. Never since her husband's absence had
its solitude felt so sat-so heavily opprcssive; thought
after thought of him thronged her mind till she fairly
gave up the effort to struggle with them.  Will his

and the deep stillness, the gloom only broken by a
small silver lamp, and the fitful light of the fire seemed
but a solemn answer. She buried her face in her clasped
hands, and the clock struck two before that inward con-

meek-trusting faith to IIi, who still watched over her
and her beloved ones; and after an earnest voiceless
prayer, she drew her little table, with its books of de-
motion to the fire, and rend thoughtfully, prayerfully,
for another hour, and then sought her couch. But she
could not sleep; the wind had again arisen, and fearing
to lie awake and listen to it would only renew her
usual agitation, she rose at four, dressed herself,
and throwing on a large shawl, softly traversed th
passage, and entered her niece's room; finding her, as
she fully expected, as wakoeful and restless as herself,
with the addition of an intense headache. She and
persuaded Nurse Languor to go to bed, but the pain
had come on since then, and made her more restless
and feverish than afore. She could not lie in any
posture to get ease, till at last, about six o'clock, come-
lately exhausted, she fell asleep, sitting almost upright
in her aunt's arms, her head leaning against her as
she stood by the bedside. Tearing to disturb her, MRs.
IIamilton would not move, desiring the morning prayers
to be said without her, and MIss IlIarcourt and her
daughters not to wait breakfast, as she would be it
with Ellen when she awoke. That she was stiff and
exhausted with three hours' standing in one position she
did not heed, perhaps scarcely felt, for woman's loveliest
attribute, that of a stone and utterly unselfish nurse,
was hers to perfection. But she did not refuse the cup
of chocolatc Caroline brought her herself, and with
affectionate earnestness entreated her to take.

Cnroline very unwillingly obeyed, and about a quarter
of an hour afterwards, Is. IIamilton was startled by the
sound of a carriage advancing with unusual elocity to
the house. It stopped at the main entrance, and she
had scarcely time to wonder who could be such very
early visitors, when a loud scream in the voice of
Emmeline rung in her ears; whether of joy or grief
she could not distinguish, but it was the voice of her
child, and the already tortured nerves of the wife and
mother could not hear it without a sensation of terror,
counting to absolute agony. She Said Ellen's head
tender on the pillow, watched over her, though he
lies so trembled she could scarcely support herself,
saw with intense relief that the movement had not dis-
turned her quiet sleep, and calling MRs. Languor from
an adjoining room, hastily descended the stairs, though
how she did so, and entered the breakfast-room, she
always said she never knew. Many and eager and glad
voices were speaking at once; the very servants througed
the hall and threshold of the room, but all made ay
for her.

It was some time before the recovered, for mind and

as he clasped her in his arms, beseeching her only to
speak to him, and gazed on her death-like countenance,

her, he had not imagined one half she had endured.
IIi voice-his kiss-seemed to rouse the scattered
senses, even more effectually than Miss Harcourt's
anxiously proffered remedies; but she could not speak,
she only looked up in his face, as if to be quite, quite
sure he had indeed returned; that her vague fancies
of danger, even if they had fonndation, had merged in the
most blissful reality, that she was no longer alone, and,
leaning her head on his bosom, was only conscious of a
thankfulness too deep for words; a repose that, since his
departure, she had not known for a single day. Neither
she nor her husband could believe that it was only six
months since they had been separated. It seemed, and to
Mrs. Milton especially, as if schemes have livedthrougl
years in that time, it had been so draught with sorrow.

tinued the affectionate girl, kneeling down by her
mother, and clinging to her, adding, in a suppressed
terrified voice, ``It was so like death,''
MRs. Milton read in a moment that Emmeline's
playfulness was only assumed to hide strong emotion;
that she was trying very hard for complete control,
but so trembling, that she knelt down, literally because
she could not stand. It was such a proof of her en-
deavour to profit by her mother's gentle lessons, that
even at that moment it not only gave her the sweetest
gratification, but helped her to rouse herself.
`Indeed, 1 think you are perfectly right, Emmy,'' she
said, quite in her usual voice, as she pressed her child a
moment to her, and kissed her cheek, which was almost
as pale as her own. `I will not submit to any scolding,

the expression upon it, it seemed to speak so many

she would grasp his whole meaning at once, but little
did she guess the whole.

keep away from him, even that short distance, but
neither she, nor either of the others, connecting her

rain and spray and so uneurled, as to lay heavy and
damp upon his pale forehead, she imprisoned n long
silent kiss upon it, and looking altcrnately at him and
her husband, seemed powerless to realize any other

Mr. IIamilton drily, but most eloquently, narrated
the events of the previous ight, dwelling only suffi-
gently on his immincnt peril, to evince the real im-
pretence of Edward's extraordinary exertions, not to
harrow the feelings of his listeners more than need be.
That the young officer's determined opposition to the
almost angrily expressed opinions of Captain IIarvey
and Old Coins as to the better landing-place, had saved
them from the effects of the huge was, which had burst
like a water-spot a minute after they had all leaped in
safety on shore, almost overwehing the projecting sand
to which Coins had wished to direct the boat, and so
proving at once Edward's for superior national no-

inevitably have been upset, and its crew washed by the
receding torrent back to sea. Slavery and Rolling a-

Edward to say so to him, but he had vanished the

not otherwise since, his gratitude. Coins and Grey re-

to have guided the boat to and from the sinking vessel,
in such a sea, was so impossible, that none would have
attempted it; Old Coins ending, with the superstition
of his class, by a declaration, that his disappearance con-
rinced his already more than suspicion, that it was some
good angel in a boy's likeness; for Arthur Milton
would never have been permitted so to perish: an ex-
planation, MIr. IHIamilton added, lauglingly, that might
suit his Emmy, but was rather too fancitul for him.
However, lis young preserver wasnowhere to be found,
but, to his extreme astonishment, and no little relief (for
now that he was so near home, his anxiety to hear of
all, especially Ellen, whom he scarcely dared hope to
find alive, became insupportable), MIr. Howard suddenly
stood before him, grasping both his hands, without the
power for a minute or two to speak. MIr. Milton
overwhelmed him with questions, scarcely giving hi
time to answer one before he asked another. They had
nearly reached the hotel, when Captain BArely's bluff
voice was heard exclaiming-
 Here he is, MIr. Hamiltonl e is too exhausted to
escape our thanks and blessings now. What could the
yongster have tried to hide himself for?''
But before Mr. IIamilton could make any rejoinder,
save to grasp the young man's hands strongly in his
own, MIr, IIovard said, eagerly-
 Oblige me, Captain IHIarvey; take that boy into our
hotel, it is only just round the corner; make him take
of his dripping jacket, and give him some of you
sailor's stuff. He is not quite strong enough for his
exertions to-night, and should rest at once.''

Captain IIarrey bore him off, almost carrying him,

faint and powerless.
 Do you know him, Towards? woman what is he?''
But MIr. TOwards did not, perhaps could not reply, but
buried his friend on to the hotel; and entered the room,
where, having called for lights and all the ingredients of
god-punch, which he vowed the boy should have instead
of the brandy and water he had called for, they found
Edward trying to laugh, and protesting against all
coddling; he was perfectly well, and he would not got
bed, and he could not imagine what right Captain
Diary had to he a sailor, if he thought so much of a
storm, and a blow, and a wetting.
 Nor should I, if you were sailor-igged; but what
business have you with this overgrown mast of a figure,
and a face pale and delicate as a woman's ?''
And so like his dying mother it was, that Mr. FAmily-

stupefied. Believe our eaders to imagine the rest; and
how Captain Have carried the seemingly marvellous
news that the brave young officer was Mr, IIamilton'e

a period for his return, knowing the comfort it would
be to his home; but M. MIlton could not bear the
idea of leaving his friend in his voluntary banishment

Edward's return, and the diseoeries thence proceeding,
his anxiety and, let it be owned, his extreme displeasure
against his nephew, prompted his return at once
POrtion not only conquered every objection to his
immediate departure, but tried, and in some measure
succeeded, to soften his anger, by bringing before im
many points in Mr. TOwards's letter, showing real
good and true repentance in the offender, which a first
perusal of a narrative of error had naturally overlooked.
The seas, however, were so fearfully tempestuous and the
winds so aderse, that it was impossible either to leave
Force, or get a letter conveyed to Scotland, for a full
fortnight after the Sense'last voyage. Nothing but the
extreme urgency of the case, increased by the fact that the
attention of the Green nt Wick had given MIr. Milton

By the time they reached the lAnd's End-they had
come westward of eNgland instead of castward as they

could not weather out another storm. The calm that

though the constant shiftings of the wind, which was
now not more than what in sailor's palace is called a

which we have before described, banished every human

slight figure with such immense exertions,-though some
time had passed, and a social, happy breakfast, round
which all still lingered, had enabled them to subdue too
painful emotion, and only to be conscious of the most
deep and grateful joy.
Pray do not call it disfiguring, Aunt; I am quite
proud of it. Last night I could have dispensed with
such a striking mark of affection from the poor Seen,

the room before any one could reply.

again; and I am sure he will be morally brave too,''
pleaded Emmeline; her sister and Miss IIarcourt joining
in the entreaty and belief, and Mrs. IIamilton looking
in his face, without uttering a word. Mr. IIamilton's
answer seemed to satisfy all parties,
Ellen meanwhile had awoke, quite refreshed, and all
pain gone, been dressed, and covered to her daily
quarters, the events of the morning entirely unknown to
her; for though the joyful news, spreading like wild-
fire through the house, had reached MRs. Lord's

enough, even without a message to that effect from

that the only effectual way of removing it was to let

party assembled in his wife's dressing-room, which, in
its clegant appurtenances-signs as they were of a most
refined and beautiful taste-certainly deserved a higher
appellation; but boudoir, Percy had always declared
did not harmonize at all with the old English comnforts
of Oakwood, and he would not have a FRench word to
designate his mother's room especially. Ellen was on
her sofa working; Edward, who she thought had only
returned that morning, at her side reading; Caroline
and Emmeline drawing, the one with some degree of
perseverance, the other with one at all. It seemed as
if she could not sit still, and her wild sallies and snatches
of old songs repeatedly made MIss IIareourt look up
from her book, and MRs. Milton from her work, sur-
praised.
Feeling, lI cannot draw,'' exclaimed Cnroline, at
length; ``you are making the table as restless as
yourself,''

still speak plain matter-of-fact, when I am going all I
can to make you poetical.''
 But what am I to promise on now, Emmeline ?-the
table or yourself? because at present they are the only
subjects under consideration, and I really cannot see
anything very poetical in either.''
Not can in me, Line?'' archly replied kEmmeline,
bending down, so that her face should come before her
sister instead of her copy, which was a very pretty small
marble figure.  Now, if you were not the most de-
remained piece of prose in the world, you would find
poetry even in my face,
For, to the artist no more gazed
On features still and cold;
DIe stood, beilder'd an amazed,
As living charms unfold.
`As if touch'd by you orient ras,
The stone to life had warm'd;
For round the lip such bright smiles play,
As never sculptor form'd.
There, Caroline, that is what you ought to have felt.
If I can make poetry on my own face-''
 Poetry on yourself. Why, Emmeline, I thought
you were repeating a verse of some old poet with view
I am unacquainted. I really beg your pardon, I did
not know your favourite Muse had lubbed of followed

 Nor did I till this moment. She feared for her
reputation near such a lover of prose as you are, and
so touched me with inspiration. I am exceedingly

obliged to her; but even if I failed to make you poetical,
Caroline, you night have emulated Cowper, and instead
of singing the Sofa,' song the  able.' Indeed, I
think a very pretty poem might be made of it. Look
at the variety of tasteful and useful things laid on a
table-and there it stands in the mist of them, in-
moveable, cold, insensible, just like one on whom we
heap favours upon favours, and who remains so wrapped
in self as to be utterly indifferent to all. Now, Cnroline,
put that into thyme, or blank verse, if you prefer it;
it is a new idea at least.''
So new,'' replied her sister, laughing, ``that I
think I will send it to grey, and request him to turn
it into a Greek or Latin ode; it will be so much grander
than my English version. You have so astonished
MAmma, Emmeline, by your mad mood, that she has
actually put down her work,''
I am so glad replied Declined, springing to her
mother's side; I like other people to be as idle as
myself.''
But there is a medium in all things, young lady,'
answered her mother, half gravely, half in Emmelinc's
own tone; ``and I rather think your conscience is
telling you, that it is not quite right to desert one Mouse
for another, as you are doing now,''
e Oh, but my drawing must wait till her Muse inspires
me again. Poetry does not always come, and her visits
are so delightful ''

only working when the fit of inspiration comes upon
you-in plain words, only when you feel inclined-
you will fritter life away without one solid thought or
acquirement. you think now, perhaps, habituated as
you are to employment, that this is impossible; but you
are just of an age to demand very strict watchfulness
over yourself to prevent it. Now that you are emerging
from the routine of childhood's lessons, and too old to
be compelled to do that which is right, and,-rendering
your task of control still more difficult,-more sunset-
table to poetry, and what you term inspiration, that her,
you must try and infuse a little of Caroline's steady
matter-of-fact into for poetry, instead of almost
despising it, as so cold and disagreeable. Now, do not
look so very sad and so very serious, love, and jump at
the conclusion that I am displeased, because I speak
seriously. I love our joyousness far too dearly to
check it, or is you to do so, especially in your own
family; but just as you have learned the necessity of,
and cinced so well and so feeling, control in em-
tons of sorrow, my kmmeline, so I am quite sure you
ill trust my experience, and practise control, been in
the pleasant inspirations of poetry and joy.''
Emmeline sat very quiet for several minutes; she
was just in that mood of extreme hilnrity which renders
control excessiely difficult, and causcs the least check
upon it to be felt as harsh and unkind, and almost to
bring tears. She was not too perfect to escape feeling
all this, even though the person who had caused it was
the mother she so denrly loved ; but she did not give
way to it. A few minutes' hard struggle, and the

momentary temper was so conquered, that, with an even
more than usually warm kiss, she promised to think
quite seriously on all her mother said, and, an effect far
more difficult, was just as joyous as before.
I have made so many mistakes in my drawing,
Mamma, I really do not think I can go on with it to-
day; do let me help you, I will take such pains with
my work, it shall be almost as neat as yours; and then,
though my fingers are employed, at least I may go on
talking.''
MRs. IIamilton assented, telling her she might talk as
much as she pleased, with one of those peculiar sills of
approval which ever made Emmeline's heart throb, for
they always told her, that the thoughts and feelings,
and secret struggle with temper, which she imagined
must be known only to herself, her mother by some
mysterious power had discovered, and rewarded.
 Edward, what are you so deep in ?-`Fragments of
Voyage and Travels'-I thought it was something much
deeper than that by the deep attention you are giving
it. You should dip in ocean, not in fragments of

smiling.

that hook, which I did merely because I had a lurking

was a sailor, I was so charmed with the tricks you all

So handsome,'' e replied, again smiling, ``that I
fear you would not have preserved your incognita half
an hour, especially with those flowing curls.''
 My dear Emmeline, do tell me, what has made you
in this mood ?'' asked Ellen; `` last week you were so
sad, and the last the days you have been-''
SaId enough to frighten you, Ellen; ah, if you did
but know the reason.''
 You had better satisfy her curiosity, Emmy,'' said
MRs. Milton, so eaningly, that Emmeline's ready
mind instantly understood her.  Tell her all that did
occur in that awful storm three days ago, as poetical
and lengthily, as you like; no one shall interrupt
you, if you will only be very careful not to exaggerate
or alarm,''
Edward gave up his seat to his cousin, and Emmeline
launched at one into a most animated description of
the storm and the shipwreck, and the rescue; cleverly
contriving so to hide all names, as to elude the least
suspicion of either the preserved or the preserver
having anything to do with herself, Ellen becoming so
exceedingly interested, as to lose sight of the question
which at first had struck her, what this could have to do
with Emmeline's wild spirits.
 You do not mean to say it was his own father he
saved ?'' she said,as her cousin paused a minute to take
breath;  your tale is coming so like a once,

I should think them so intense, so sacred, as to be

even by your vivid fancy, Emmy.''
I don't know, Ellen, but I think I can imagine
them; you may shake your lead, and look wise, but I
will prove that i can by and by. But what do you think
of my hero?''
 That I should like to know him, and admire him

tinued Emmeline, playfully putting back Edward's hair,
that Ellen might see the scar, She understood it in a
moment, and clasping her arms round her brother's
neck, as he knelt by her, tried hard to prevent emotion,
but could not, and burst into tears.
 Tears, my little Ellen; I said I would only be
greeted with smiles,'' exclaimed a rich deep voice close
beside her, and before she had time to fear his presence,
she felt herself clasped with all a father's fondness in
her uncle's arms; er head resting on his shoulder,
and his warm kiss on her cheek.

sin; but even if I still wish the temptation had been
resisted, you hae indeed suffered for it, more than the
harshest judgment could desire; let it be forgotten as
entirely and fully as it is forgiven.''
In a very few minutes Ellen's composure was so fully
restored, and her hensy dread so subsided, that the relief
seemed to her almost a dream. Could it be possible that
it was the relative she had pictured as so harsh and stern.

and pitiless to youthful crror, who had drawn a chair
else by her sofa, and caressingly holding her hand in
his, and looking so kindly, so earnestly, in her altered
face, was trying to amuse her by telling her so many
entertaiuing things about Here and In. Merton, and
his voyage home, and alluding to her brother's courage,
and prudence, and skill, in such terms as almost brought
the tears again Mr. IIamilton was inexpressibly shocked
at the change which mental and bodily suffering had
wrought in his niece. There is always something pecu-
hardly touching and appealing to the best emotions in
youthful sorrow or suffering of any kind; and her trial
had been such an aggravated one-combining such
agonised remorse, for an act, which the harshcst judge-
ment, knowing all points of the case, could scarcely
pronounced as other than involuntary, with the most
heroic but perfectly unconscious self-sacrifice, and
not only terror for her brother's fate, but nan almost
crushing sense of misery for his faults,-that the pallid
face, and frame so delicately fragile, had still deeper
claims for sympathy and cherishing than even when
caused by ordinary illness. The loss of her unusually
luxuriant hair, except the soft bands which shaded her
face, visible under the pretty little lace cap, made her
look much younger than she really was, and so delicately
transparent had come her complexion, that the blue
veins were clearly traceble on her forehead, and throat,
and hands ; the only soft lash seemed longer than before,
as it swept the pale cheek, the brow more pencilled,
and the eye, whether in imagination from her friends
knowing all she had endured, or in reality, was so

expressise of such deep quiet feeling, that the whole
countenance was altered and so improved that it seemed
as if the heavy sallow child was rapidly changing into
one of those sweet, loreable, heart-attractive girls, who,
without any actual beaut, can never be passed un-
noticed.
At Ellen's earnest request, MIss. IIamilton had, as soon
as she was strong enough, read it her, morning and
evening, the devotional exercises which were read below
to the assembled family. MRs. Milton soon perceived,
and with no little pain, that Ellen shrunk from the
idea of being well enough to rejoin them, in actual
suffering. Here again was an effect of that some isid
imagination, of whose existence, until the late events,
in one so quiet, seemingly so cold, MRs. Milton had
not the least idea of. Ellen had been so long face-
tomed to be silent as to her feelings, in fact, carefully
to conceal them, that much as she might will and
intend to be unreserved, her aunt feared it would cause
her some difficult to he so, and she could not hope
to succeed in controlling imagination unless she ere.
That night, however, Ellen's unresered confidence gave
her hope. When the devotional esercises, in which
she had joined with even more than usual earnestness
and fervour, were concluded, she said, with almost
Emmeliue's confidence, as she laid her hand on her
aunt's,
I am so very, very happy to-night, dear Aunt, that
I am afraid I do not think enough of what is past. I
did so rend my uncle's return-so tremble at what his
sentence would be on Edward and myself, that even

your kindness would not remove the weight; and now,
that I have found it all so groundless, and he is so kind

have thought more of his anger than the anger of God.
MY sin remains the same in IIi sight, though you and
Uncle IIamilton hae so fully forgiven it, and-and-
I do not think I ought to feel so happy.''
 Indeed, my dear Ellen, I think you may. Our
heavenly Father is still more merciful than man, as
M. Inward so clearly proved to you, in the long
conversation you had with him. We know, by His Holy
Word, that all He asks is sincere repentance for sin,
and a firm conviction that in Ilim only we are made
sufficiently righteous for our existence to be accepted.
I believe, Ellen, that IIi forgiveness was yours, long
before I could give you mine, for He could read your
heart, and sins the reason of your silence, and all the
remorse and suffering, which, from the appearances
against you, I might not even guess; and that, in HIs
compassionating love and pity, DIe permitted your in-
ceased trial; remaining even the failure of the relief to
Edward, to convince you, that, not even in such a fearful
case as yours, might crror, however involuntary, prosper.

of joy or sorrow, to Him. Associate Him with your
eery thought, and believe me, my own Ellen, your
very happiness will both law you nearer to Him, and
be an acceptable offering in his sight.''
Ellen listened eagerly, gratefully; she felt as if, with
every word MIss. Milton said, the film of doubt and
ague fancies was dissolving from her mind, and, after
a short pause, she said-
1when you do not think, Aunt Emmeline, my
inability to pray for so long a time, was a proof that
God had utterly forsaken me it made me still more
wretched, for I thought it was a sure sign that I was
so irredeemably wicked, DIe had left me to the devices
of my own heart, and would never love or have mercy
on me again. Even after you lad quite forgiven me,
and proved to me my promise was a mistaken one and
not binding, I still felt the difficulty to pray, and it was
so painful.''
Such inability is very often so entirely physical,
my dear Ellen, that we must not think too much about
it. Our simple duty is to persevere, however little
satisfactory our emotion; and put our firm trust in
one heaven Father, that He will deal us, and permit
His countenance so to shine upon us again, as to derive
comfort from our prayers. Your inability before your
illness was the natural consequence of MIr. Howard's
severe representations, which he has since assured me,
he never would have used, if he could have had the least
idea of the cause of your silence. You, my poor child,

couflicting feelings and duties to be able to realize this;

and I am not at all astonished, that when you must
cared for the comfort of prayer and trust, the thought
that by your silence you were failing in your duty to
me and so disobeying God, should utterly have pre-
vented it. Since you severe illness the inability has
been entirely physical. As strength and peace return,
you will regain the power, and realize all its come-
fort. Try, and under all feelings trust in and love
God, and do not be too much elated, when you can think
seriously and pray joyfully, or too desponding we
both fail you. In you present state, physical causes
alone, so often occasion these differences of feeling in
house of devotion, that if we thought too much about
them, we should constantly think long, and be very
miserable. Try and prove your desire to love and serve
God, in your daily course and secret though, my
Ellen, and you will be able to judge of your spiritual
improvement by action and feeling, far more truly and
justly than by te moon in which you pray,''
The earnestness of truth and feeling was always so
impressed on Its. Milton's manner, whenever she
addressed her youthful charge, that her simplest word
had weight. HAppy indeed is it when youth-that
season of bewildcring doubt and question, and visit,
often mistaken fancies, and too impetuous feeling-has
the rich blessing of such affectionate counsels, such a
friend. WHy will not woman rise superior to the petty
employments and feelings too often alone attributed to
her, and endeavour to fit yourself for such twice blessed

A fortnight after Mr. Milton's arrival, Ellen was
well enough to go down stairs for part of the day, and
even to read and write little. She was so very anxious
to commence her studies, which for so many months
had been so painfully neglected, that it was a great
trial to her, to find her head was not yet strong enough
for the necessary application. There were many, very
many priations and trials, attendant on conalescence
after so severe an illness, known only to Ellen's own
heart, and to her aunt's quick sympathy; and she very
quickly learned in them the meaning of Mrs. Hamiltou's
words regarding religion in conduct and feeling, as
well as in prayer. She tried never to murmur, or dwell
on the wish for pleasures which were denied her, but
to think only on the many blessings which surrounded
her. It was not an easy task so to conquer natural
feeling, especially as the trial and its conquest was often
known only to herself; but the earnest wish, indeed,
to become holy in daily conduct, as well as in daily
prayer, never left her mind, and so enabled her at
length fully to obtain it.

bond's public as well as domestic worth, she would have
had it fully now. IIi danger and his preservation once

joyously exclaimed Emmeline, as she ran into the
usual sitting-room, one of those lonely afternoons, that,
the first days of MArch so often bring, promising spring
long before she really comes. `It is such a picturesque
cottage, and Dame Coins and Susan, and a host of
little ones, look so nice, and so clean, and so pretty, and
happy; it does one's heart good to look at them.''

Mrs, Calling is really a sensible woman. dO you

 Yes, my dear. She has brought up her own large
family and her poor orphan grandchildren so atmi-
rably, in the midst of their extreme poverty, and bears
such a name for kindness, amongst her still poorer
neighbours, that I truly respect and admire her. She
is quite one of those in whom I have often told you
some of the very loftiest virtues are to be found; and
yet to see her, as she trudged about in her homely
humble fashion, never dreaming she is doing or has
lone anything remarkable in her hard-working life, who

Caroline, smiling.

neck.

 You are very seldom proud now, dearest Line, and
I was the foolish one not to have guessed what you

First tell Mamma,'' interrupted Caroline, that
WIlliam Gray has chosen to be a partner with Rolling in
the more extended fishing and boating business, which
Papa has secured them, instead of entering into busy-
ness by himself; this has been settled since you were
there, I think.''
 Yes, my dear, I did not know it ; but Mrs. Calling
must like it, for she regretted very much that her sons
were all scattered in different trades, and her little
grandson, whose taste pointed to the sea, not old enough
to go out with his grandfather.''
 But only listen to my plan, MAmma, dear William
Gray and Susan Coins cannot possibly see much of
each other, without falling in love; and they will make
such an industrious pretty couple, and Papa will give
them a cottage to themselves, and I will go to their
wedding l''
Just such a plan as I should expect from your
giddy brain, Emmy. But how do you know that Gray
has any desire for a wife?'
 Oh, because Edward said he could not help remark-
ing, even in the midst of that awful scene, how mourn-
fully he said, he would bear a hand, for he had neither
mother, sister, nor wife to pipe for him; now if he mar-
rid Susan, he would have a very pretty wife to lament
him

Poor Susan, I fancy she wouldrather not become his
wife, if it he only to mourn for him, Emmy; rather a

Oh, but MAmma dear you know that I dont mean
exactly and only that; somebody to be interested for
him, and lore him. No one can be happy without
that.''
` Susan was telling me, Mamma, how thankful sheis
to you, for finding her and her sister employment,
that they might be able to help the family,'' rejoined
Caroline. I was quite pleased with her manner of
speaking, and she blushed so prettily when MIss
Harcourt praised the extreme neatness of her work,''
 Al, MAmma, if you could but hear all they say of
you:'' again burst forth Emmeline, who it seemed
could not be quiet, going from one subject to an-
ther with the same eager zest; 'if you had but

pride, when she saw you enter their former miser-

it her to tell, and listened to all her troubles, just

such hope behind you, as had not been theirs for many

and respect is so easy, so delightful, that there is no
merit in obtaining it. We ought only to be thankful,
when granted such a station and such influence as will
permit extended usefulness and thought for others,
without wronging our own.''
 Yes; but, Mamma, many people do a great deal of
good, but somehow or other they are not called,''
 Because, perhaps, in their earnest desire to come-
polish a great deal of good, they may not think quite
enough of little things, and of the quick sympathy with
other person's feelings, which is the real secret of win-
king love, and without which, sometimes even the
greatest benefit is not alued as it ought to be. But
did you see Old Coins himself?'
 He came in just before we left, and was so delighted
to see Papa sitting in his inglenook, and only wished

 Yes, but Edward wanted him, and they are in the

earnestly at her brother all the time he spoke, and then
turned her face away, and a few quiet tears trickle
down her cheek. Edward's arm was very quickly round
her, and le whispered so many fond words and earnest
assuranees, united with his conviction that it would
still be a whole month, perhaps more, before he
should be summoned, as he had never to remain with
his family till the a ucen as ready to sail, that she
rallied her spirits, and, after remaining very quiet for an
hour, which was always her custom when she had had
any struggle with herself, for the frame felt it,-though
neither word nor sign betrayed it,-she was enabled
fully to enjoy the grand delight of the cening-Percy
and Herbert's arrival.
Enter week was indeed one of family joy and thank-
fulness, not only that they were all permitted once more
to be together, but that the heavy clouds of sin and sun-
fearing had rolled away from their roof, and pleasure of
the sweetest, out cenduring, because most domestic
kind, reigned triumphant. Percy's astonishment at
Edward's growth, and the alteration from the handsome,
joyous, rosy boy, to the pale, almost care-worn looking
youth (for as long as Ellen bore such vivid traces, of
all she had endured for his sake, and was, at it were, the
constant presence of his errors, Edward tried in vain to
recover his former spirits,) was most amusing.

The lays passed much too quickly. Feeling wished
a dozen times that the days would be twenty-four instead
of twelve hours long. The weather was so genial that it
added to enjoyment, and allowed Ellen the delight,
known only to such prisoners to sickness as she had
been, of driving out for an hour or two at a time, and
taking gentle walks on the terrace and in the garden.
The young men were to return on the MOnday, and on
the Saturday previous a little excursion had been
planned, to which the only drawback was that Ellen

as to visit Alice Seaton, whom we mentioned in a
former chapter. Mr. IIamilton had succeeded in find-

one of the neighbouring towns, a few miles from where
she and her aunt now lived, enabling young enton to
spend every Sabbath with them; and Alice now kept a

so well as never to want sclolars. It had been a long

were both at home and at leisure the last day in Easter,
it had been fixed upon for the visit. Percy was revelling
in tlc idea of driving his mother and Miss IIarcourt in
a new barouche, and the rest of the party were to go on
horseback. But a dispute had arisen who should stay
with Ellen, and Edward insisted upon it, it was His
right, and so they thought it was agreed.
I wish, dear Pcrcy, you would prevail on Edward
to accompany you,'' pleaded Ellen, fancying herself alone
with him, not seeing HIerbert who was reading at a
distant table.
I wish, dear Ellen, you were going with us,'' he
answered, mimicking her tone.
 But as I cannot make him go. It always makes
him more unhappy when I am prevented any pleasure
than it does myself; and I cannot bear to keep him by
me four or five hours, when this lovely day, and the
exercise of riding, and, above all, your company, Perry,
would make him, at least for the time, almost his own
merry self again.''
 Thanks for the implied compliment, cousin mine,''
replies Percy, with a low bow.
 Reward me for it, and make him go,''
DOwn on I be so gallantly, as to make him leave
you alone?''
Oh, I do not mind it, I assure you I am well

Dear Percy, what can you mean? If you knew
how hard I find it to be patient sometimes, you would
not praise me.''
I mean that the last time I was at home, I was
blind and cruel, and added to your sufferings by my
uncalled-for harshness, and never had an opportunity
till this moment to say, now grieved I was-when the
truth was known.''
`Pray do not say anything about it, dear Perry,''
entreated his cousin, the tears starting to her eyes, as
he kissed her warmly; ' it was only just and natural
you should have felt indignant with me, for causing
Aunt Emmeline so much misery, and allowing all the
enjoyment of your holidays. I am sure you need not
reproach yourself;--but will you make Edward go?''

he met Herbert.

that Edward will go, Ellen.''

Whatever Ellen might have said to convince him she
could be happy alone, the beaming look of pleasure on
her countenance satisfied all parties as to the excellence
of this arrangement; and happy, indeed, the day was.
Herboert seemed to understand her expressed feelings
so fully; and that always makes the charm of cover-
station, whatever its subject. We do not require the e-
passion in words of sympathy,-it is an indescribable
something that betraysits existence. Favourite authors-
and Herbert was almost surprised at Ellen's dawning
taste and judgment in literature-the delights of Nature
after a long confinement, as if every flower were more
sweet, every bit of landscape, or wood, or water more
beautiful, and the many holy thoughts and pure joys
springing from such feelings, were all discussed, either
costly in their sitting-room, or in their ramble in the
garden; and after Ellen's early dinner, which IIerbert
shared with her as lunch, she proposed what she
knew he would like, that her drive should be to Groevillc
Mayor, and they might spend a full hour with their
friends, and yet be back in time. Herbert assented
gladly; and the warm welcome they received, Mrs

Groeille's kind care of Ellen, and Mary's eager chat
with her and Herbert, and the number of things they
seemed to find to talk about, made the hour literally
fly ; but Herbert, enjoyable as it was, did not forget his
charge, and drove her back to Oakwood, while the sun
still shone bright and warmly: and when the party re-
turned, which they did only just in time to dress for
dinner, and in the wildest spirits, the balance of pleasure
at home and abroad, would certainly have been found
quite equal.
Ellen still continued quietly to lie down in her
own room while the family were at dinner, for she
was then sufficiently refreshed to join them for a few
hours in the evening. Perecy and Emmeline, at dinner
that day, kept up such a fire of it and mirth, that it
was somewhat difficult for any one else to edge in a
word, though Edward and Caroline did sometimes con-
tried to bring a whole matter against themselves. Just
as the dessert was placed on the table, however, sounds
of rural music in the distance, dancing nearer and
nearer, caused Percy to pause in his wild sallies, and
spring with Edward to the window, and their clear-
nations soon compelled all the party to follow their
example, and send for Ellen to see the unexpected sight
too. Banners and pennons floated in the sunshine, and
the greater part of the national inhabitants of Dartmouth
were marshnlled in goodly array beside them, headed
by Captain leaves and his crew, with Old Coins in
the midst of them; they were all attired in the ne
clothing which MIr. Milton had presented to them;

face, the very peculiar curls in which his really yellow
hair was twisted, and the quit of tobacco, from which
even, on this grand occasion, he could not relieve his
mouth and cheek. A band of young men and girls
surrounded the first banner, which, adorned with large
bunches of primroses and violets up the staff, bore the
words `` IInmilton and Benevolence;'' and amongst
them Emmeline speedily recognized William Grey and
Susan Calling, walking side by side, she looking down
and smiling, and he so earnestly talking, that she his-
peered to her mother with the greatest glee, that her
plan would take place after all. Then came a band of
sturdy fishermen, chums and esatates of Coins,
and then a band of boys and girls, from all MIr. Milton's
own village schools, decked in their holiday attire, and
holding in their hands tasteful garlands of all the
spring flowers they could muster, and bearing two large
manners, one with the words,  Fortescue for ever All
hail to British sailors ;'' and the other, a representation
of the scene on the beach that eventful night, and the
sinking vessel in the distance. The workmanship was
rude indeed, but the effect so strikingly descriptive, that
MIss. IIamilton actually shuddered as she gazed, and
grasped almost unconsciously the arm of her nephew as
he stood by her, as if the magnitude of the danger, both
to him and her husband, had never seemed so vivid
before.
The windows of the dining-room had been thrown
widely open, and as the rustic procession came in sight
of those to whom their whole hearts tendered homage,

they halted; the music ceased, and cheer on cheer re-
sounded, till the very echoes of the old park,were startled
out of their sleep, and sent the shout back again. Percy
was amongst them in a moment, singling out Old Coins,
whom he had tried repeatedly to see since is visit
love, but never found him, and grasped and shook
both his hands with the full vehemence of his character,
pouring out the first words that chose to come, which
better expressed his grateful feelings to the old man
than the most studied speech. William Grey had already
received substantial proofs of his gratitude, and so he
had then only a kind nod, and a joke and look at the
pretty, blushing Susan, which said a vast deal to both,
and seemed as if he quite second Emmelinec's plan,-
mingling joyously with all,-he had bluff words, after
their own hearts, for the men, smiles for the maidens,
and such wild jokes for the children, as lost them all
decorum, and made them shout aloud in their glee.
Herbert scorned him quite as well as his quicker
nature would allow. Edward had hung back, been
hen his name was called outlustily, as if he could not
bear such homage.

be half complete without you,'' whispered MRs. FAmily-

The cloud dispersed from brow and heart in a no-
ment; and he was in the midst of them, glad and buoyant
almost as Percy, while the cheer which greeted him
was almost overpowering to his sister, so much humble
yet earnest feeling did it speak.
You really should have given us timely notice of
your intentions, my good friend,'' said Mr. HIamilton,
warmly grasping Captain Heaven's hand. ` At least
we might have provided some substantial refreslent
after your long march, as I fear we have but slender
fare to offer you, though Well and Morris are busy
already, I am happy to see.''
And urged on by their own delight at this homage both
to their master and his young preserver, who had
become a complete idol amongst them, a long table was
speedily laid in the servants' hall, covered with a variety
of cold meats, and bread and cheese in abundance, and
horns of cydcr sparkling brightly beside each trencher.
Fruit and cakes eagerly sought for by Emmeline, were
by her distributed largely to the children, who remained
seriously grouped on the lawn, their glee at the treat
lieightenedby the sweet and gentle manner of its bestowed.

receiving and returning their greeting, thanking them for
the help they had so sufficiently given her brother, made
them still wonder and happier than before. After an
hour and a half of thorough enjoyment-for their
humble homage to worth and goodness had been received
in the same spirit as it had been tendered-the procession
marshalled itself in the same order as it had come; and
rude as the music was, it sounded, as Emmeline de-
cared, really beautiful, becoming fainter and fainter
in the distance, and quite picturesque the effect of the
manners and pennons, as they gleamed in and out the

IIi own by this time gave universal satisfaction.
The talents of his sisters had been so cultivated, as a
means of glancing home-happiness, and increasing
their own resources, that their musical evenings were
always perfect enjoyment. Cnroline, indeed, improed
as she was, still retained her love of admiration suffi-
society, to find still greater enjoyment in playing and
singing when there were more to listen to her, than
merely her own fairy, but the feeling, in the security
and pure atmosphere of Oakwood, was kept under control,
and she could find real pleasure in gratifying her brothers,
though not quite to the same extent as Emmeline.
Percy, after comfortably settling Ellen, threw himself
on the most luxurious chair he could find, stretched out
his legs, placed his head in what he called the best
position for listening and enjoying, and then called for
duets on the harp and piano, single pieces on both, and
song after song with the most merciless rapidity.
 Your sisters shall neither play or sing to you any
more,'' his mother, at length, lauglingly said, ``unless
you rouse yourself from this disgraceful idle fit, and
take your lute, and join them.''
Mother, you are lost to every sensation of mercy
after all my exertions, where am I to find breath?''

It was so very close to him as he approached the

pcrformed, Percy declared with professional coat.
Now don't go, Percy, we want your voice in a song.

voice has deserted him, or I should enlist him also.

I cannot sing it, dear Caroline; do not ask me,''
answered Emmeline, with a confusion and timidity,
which at home were perfectly incomprehensible.
 WHy, my little Emma, I am quite curious to hear this
new song; do not disappoint me'' said her father, in-
couragiogly.
 But after Caroline I cannot sing worth hearing,'
still pleaded Emmeline.
 MY dear child, I never heard you make such a
foolish excuse before; your mother and myself never
find any difference in the pleasure that listening to
your music bestows, however one performer may be
more naturally gifted than the other.''
I declare I must sing it, if it be only for the mystery
of Tiny's refusing,'' said Percy, laughing. Come,

The words, however, seemed sufficiently satisfactory
for them readily to join in it. Emmeline still hesitated,
almost painful; but then gathering courage, she sat
down to her harp, and, without any notes before her,
played a few bars of one of those sweet thrilling Irish
melodies, so suited to her instrument, and then come-
menaced her song, the sweetness of her voice, and clear-
ness of articulation atoning well for her deficiency in
the power and brilliant which characterized her sister.
The words were exceedingly simple, but sung with deep
feeling, and heart-appealing as they were, from the
subject, we hope our readers will judge them as
evidently as Emmeline's hearers.

Emmeline's voice had at first trembled audibly, but
seeming to deride courage from her sister and brother's
accompaniment, which, from their knowledge of music,
was so beautifully modulated as to permit her sweet
voice to be heard above all, and every word clearly
distinguished, it became firmer and more earnest as she
continued, till she forgot everything but the subject of
her song. For full a minute there was silence as she
ceased, but with an irresistible impulse Mr. Milton
rose from his seat, and, as Emmeline left her harp, he
clasped her in his arms.
 How can I thank you, my Emmeline, and all

with more emotion than he generally permitted to be

Percy, as Emmeline, breaking from her father, sat down
on her favourite stool at her mother's feet, and hid her face
in her lap. Mrs. Milton laid her hand caressingly
on those soft curls, but, though she smiled, she did
not speak.
She will not tell, and you will none of you guess,''
said Cauroline, laughing.
e You are in the secret, so out with it,'' said Ward.
 Not I; I am pledged to silence.''
Mother, dear, tell us for pity,'' pleaded IIerbert.
I can only guess, for I am not in her confidence, I
assure you,'' she replied, in the same playful tone, and
raising lmmeline's lowered hand, she looked a moment
in those conscious eyes.  Dictated by my Emmeline's

shape, in the recesses of her own fanciful brain-is not

as her sister's face was again concealed.

with a most affectionate kiss; and her mother looked at
her with such an expression of gratified pleasure, that
she could not helpaeknowledgiug to herself, such pure

answered kmmeline, forgetting, in her surprise at her
cousin s penetration, that she betrayed herself.
 Because I should have felt the same,'' said Ellen,
simply.
Then 1 must have explained myself very badly, my

And so I transform oneMIuse into another,'' exclaimed
Perrys, who, in his sister's absorbed attention, had neared
her unobserved, and catching her round the waist, bore
her to the upper end of the room, and n minute after-
words she was enjoying her waltz, with as much childish
glee, as if neither poetry or reflection could hae
anything to do with her.
Why is poetry a dangerous gift, dear Aunt?'' in-
quite Ellen, who had listened earnestly to all Mrs.
IIamilton had said.

poetry. To an well-regulated mind and temper, the
danger is not of the same serious kind, as to the irregu-
late, but merely consists, in the powerful temptation
it too often presents to neglect duties and employments
of more consequence for its indulgence. There is a
species of fascination in the conposition of even tlc
most inferior poetry, which urges its pursuit, as giving
so little trouble compared to the pcrseveranee necessary
for music and drawing, and such a vast amount of
pleasure, that it is difficult to withdraw from it. ThiS
is still more strongly the case when the young first
become conscious of the gift, as Emmeline is now. As
she gets older, and her taste impulses, she will not be
satisfied with her efforts, unless they are very superior
to the present, and the trouble she will take in correct-
ing and improving, will remove a great deal of the
too dangerous fascination attending it now; still I am
not anxious, while she retains her confidence in my
affection and experience, and will so control the enjoy-
mcnt, as not to permit its interference with her the
more serious employments.''
Ellen listened really, and they continued conversing
on many similar topics of interest and improvement,

gloom ever marked the signal for the hour of devotion,
but lighter pleasures always ceased a few minutes before,
that they might better realize the more serious thought
an service.
MIs. IInmilton had never ceased to regret the dis-
grace she had inflicted on Ellen, in not permitting her
to retain her own place with the family, at least in the
hours of devotion, for it seemed more difficult to remove
that impression than any of her other trials. Returning
he niece's startled look with one of the sincerest affect-
lion, she said-
 You will remain with us to-night, my dear ellen,
will you not ?''
If you wish it, Aunt.''
I do wish it, dearest, most earnestly. It is so long
since I have had the happiness of seeing all my children
round re in this solemn hour, and till you join us, I
cannot feel quite sure that you have indeed forgiven an
act of severity, which, cold I but have suspected the
truth, I should peer have inflicted.''
 Forgiven :-you'' repeated ellen, in utter astouish-
ment, but rising instant. aunt immense, dear
Aunt Emmeline, pray do not speak so; why did
on not tell me your wish before? I would have con-
queer my own disinclination to enter the library
weeks ago; indeed, indeed, it only seemed associated
with my own guilt and misery.''
MRs. IIamilton drew her arm fond in hers, refusing
for her the aid of either of the young men, who had all
hastened towards her, and led her herself to the library,
and to her usual place beside Emmeline. MAny an

was directed towards her by the assembled household,
the greater part of who had not seen her since the
night of Edward's confession; and the alteration in her
appearance, the universal sympathy which her danger-
out illness and its cause had cnlle forth, even in the
humblest and most ignorant-for it is the heart, not the
mind, which is required for the comprehension of self-
devotion-her very youth seeming to increase its many-
rude, lad inspired such a feeling of love, that could she
have known it, would have prevented that painful sense-
lion of shyness.
MAny, many thoughts thronged her mind, as her
uncle's impressive voice fell on her ear; thoughts,
which though they prevented her following the words
of the prayers, and caused the tears, spite of every effort,
to stream through her slender fingers, yet turned into
thankfulness and praise, ere the service ceased, that fiery
as the ordeal had been, she could still recognize a hand
of love, and bless God, not only for the detection of her
involuntary sin, but for every pang she had endured.
The next lay was Sandy, bringing with it all sorts of
quiet sober pleasures of its own, only alloyed by the
thought that it was the last day of Perry's and HErbert's
visit. The following morning they started for Oxford,
MIr. Hanilton and Edward intending to accompany
them part of the way, and then proceed to Ashburton,
where the former had business, and then make a little
tour through Plymouth home. The next day was so
beautifully fine and genial, that Emmeline declared it
would lo ellen the greatest possible good to go with
her a few miles out of the park, to see a waterfall she

te sky more brillantly blue, than they ever had been be-
fore; and that the very sound of the water, as it rushed
down a black rock, and threw up spray, which the rays
of the sun rendered so beautifully iridescent, as to seem
like a succession of rainbow, was a whole volume of
poetry in itself.
'And what extraordinary vision do you think that

Ellen, (whom her aunt now observed looked agitated and

MIr. MIlton and Edward entered almost imme-
lately afterwards, the latter evidently very much
agitated, the former so tranquil and cheerful, that the
momentary vanity of his wife was calmed directly. DIe
laughed nt their bewilderment, and said that an im-
portant letter had reached him at Ashburton, summon-
ing him to llymouth, and so he thought he would just see
low all was going on at Lowood first. This was not
at all a satisfactory reason from MIr. IInmilton. Edward
evidently tried to answer Ellen's inquiries quietly, but
he could not, and exclaiming, ` You tell her, my dear
Uncle I cannot,'' ran out of the room. MIr. IIumilton
instantly changed lis jesting her, so far as quietly
and nflcctionnately to sent his niece beside him, and tell

directly.
It is a trial, my dear Ellen, a very hard one just now,
under all circumstances; but i am sure you will bear
it with fortitude, for Edward's sake. The only draw-
back to his happiness in being again permitted to for-
low his profession, is the thought of the trial it will be
to you.''
 ut when must we part? when must he leave Oak-

of quiet sorrow, her uncle could not for the moment
reply.

A low cry escaped involuntarily from Ellen's lips, as
she buried her face on the cushion of the couch where
she was sitting, and an exclamation of surprise and re-
great broke fro all. MRs. Milton felt it almost as
much as ellen, from it only her own unspoken anxiety,
as to whether indeed his home influence would see
him from temptation in future, but that she could enter
into every thought and feeling which in Ellen met so
aggravates the actual parting,-always a sorrow in itself
After a few minutes Ellen raised her head, and, though
her cheek was perfectly colourless, eery tear was
checked.

Only beg him to come to me, that we may spend the

long sorrow, to enter into his naturally glad anticipations,
that her brother felt as if he could not love, nor one-
rate her enough.
DIe was obliged to leave Oakwood (accompanied by
his uncle) so early the next morning, that all his pre-
relations had to be complete by that night. Else's
activity, though she could not endure the ideas of his
going, speedily and satisfactorily settled that matter.
Robert Languor, who had only regained his natural
light-heartedness since Ellen had taken her usual place
in the family, always declaring is carelessness had been
the origin of all her misery, was another so active in his
service, that Edward had only to give a hint of anything

he wanted, even if it could only be procured at some
distance, and it was instantly obtained.
The hours wore on, the evening devotion were con-
clouded, but still the family lingered in the library: so
many things there seemed to say, for MIr, IIamilton and
MIss IIarcourt would not let the conversation flag, and
Edward would talk and laugh as if he were only going
from home for a few days. Midnight chimes, but still
MRs. Ilamilton felt as if she could not give the signal
for separation: but when one struck, there was a
general start, and an unanimous declaration it could not
be so late.
 I assure you it is,'' Mrs. Milton cheerfully said;
``and poor Reward will get no sleep, if we do not scpa-
rate at once. DIe must certainly send you a box of art-.
ficial roses, for this unusual dissipation will bear all the
natural ones way. Ellen, love, I must be cruel enough to
resist that pleading look; remember, your full strength
as not yet returned.''
She spoke kindly, but firmly, and there was a general
move. ward lughingly promised to send lis cousins
the very best box of rouge he could procure at Ll-
mouth, and wished them good night as gaily as if they
should meet as usual the next morning. Once only his
voice faltered,- ellen, love, good night My own
sister, God in IIenven bless you?'' were all he said, the last
sentence escaping as if involuntarily, as if he he merely
meant to say good night; and for more than a minute
the brother and sister were clasped inch other's arms.
There were tears in Mrs. Milton's eyes, and her

husband's were most unwonted dim, for words were
not needed to reel to them the trial of that moment
to those two young hearts. To Ellen's especially, for
her lot was woman's-to endure until time should prove
the reality of Edward's resolution, ad mark him indeed
the noble character his disposition so fondly promised.
IIi was active service, the banishment of thought by
dee. Breaking from her brother, and not daring to
address either her aunt or uncle, lest her control should
fail her too soon, Ellen hastened from the room.
Go to her, Aunt Emmeline; oh, tell her I will
ever, never cause her to suffer again .'' implored
Ward, as soon as he could speak, and clasping his
aunt's hand,  She has been struggling with herself
the whole evening for my sake, and she will suffer for
it to-morrow, unless she gie it vent, and she will weep
less painfully if you speak of comfort.''
 She will be better alone a little while, my dear boy;
young as she is, she knows where to seek and find come-
fort, and her tears will flow more freely, conscious only
of the presence and healing of her God. I shall not
part from you now. Well wanted me for some directions
about your things, and I will come to you in your room
afterwards,''
MRs. lIamilton knew the human heart well. When she
went to Ellen, the paroxysm of natural sorrow had had
bent, and her sympathy, her earnestly expressed con-
action, that the trill of beholding crror and remorse in
one so beloved would not occur again, could bring come-
fort. The tears indeed might still are flowed the faster
perhaps at the voice of kindness, but there was dealing
in them; and when her aunt left her to go to eDward,

she sent him a fond message that she was better, and in
a few days would be happy, quite happy, for his sake.
It was late before MIss. IIailton quitted her nephew.
We will not repeat ull that passed between them, all
that that fond, watchful relative so earnestly, so as-
appealing said. Not much in actual words of counsel
had she ever before addressed him, feeling that that
duty was better performed by Mr. Forward and his
uncle. She hat simply tried to influence him by the
power of love, of forbcnrance, of sympathy with his re-
more, and pity for his errors. In the wretchedness,
the fearful anxiety, ellen's danger and painful illness
had occasioned herself indiidually, she had near
spoken, or even let full a sentence which could reproach
him as the cause of all; and therefore, now that she
did give her anxious affection words, they were so
spoken, that her nephew never forgot them.

interview, '` as if nothing could tempt me to ear again;

so for its own sake. It bears a name within it which I
think will ever keep it sacred in your care, as it has

Edward opened it eagerly,  Charles Manners l'' he

only too soon realized. I never saw him again; and
that little book indeed increase in value.''
Iler voice faltered, for even yet the memory of her
brother was so dear to her that she could never speak of

surface that it should be equally valuable to him,

`And not likely, my dear boy; think of the lapse
of years. But painful as it is, we must separate,
Edward: I must not detain you from rest and sleep
any longer. Only give me one promise,-if ever you
are led into temptation and crror again, and it may be-
for our strongest esolutions sometimes fail us-write to
me without the smallest hesitation, openly, freely; tell
me all, and if you need aid, ask it, and I will give it;
and, if it be possible, avert your uncle's displeasure. I
have no fear that, in telling you this, I am weakening
your resolution, but only to prevent one fault becom-
ing many by concealment-from dread of anger, and
therein the supposed impossibility of amusement.
Remember, my beloved boy, you have a claim on me
which no error nor fault can remove; as, under Prove-
dance, the preserver of my husband, I can never change
the anxious love I bear you. You my indeed male me

look on your noble deed with all the love, the admire-
lion it deserves. Promise me that, under any difficulty
or error, small or great, you will write to me as you
would have done to your own beloved mother, and I
shall haste no fear remaining.''
Edward did promise, but his heart was so full he
could not restrain himself any longer, and as MRs.
IIamilton folded him to her heart, in a silent but tearful
embrace, he went on her shoulder like a child.

With Ellen, too, mrs. IInmilton's anxious care was
bringing in fair promise of success-the mistaken in-
influence of her childhood, and their increased effect from
a morbid imagination, produced from constant suffering,
appearing indeedabout to be holly eradicated. Anxious
to remove all said associations connected with the
library, MRs. Milton, having catherine herself to
superintend eLlen's studies, passed long mornings in that
ancient room with her, so deligltfully, that it became
associated only with the noble authors whose works, or
extracts from whom, she read and recalled in, and

expausivc idea, such calling and earnest truths, that
she felt becoming to herself a new being. Lively and
thoughtless as Declined she could not now indeed
become, alike as their dispositions naturally were; but
she was more quietly, enduringly happy than she had
ear remembered herself.
here was only one alloy, one had thought, that would

required many, many pcrsuasions and many assurances,
that she never could be quite happy, unless it was
accomplished, which could prevail on her to grant it.
Ellen knew, felt, more and more each week, that she
could not rest till she had laboured for, and obtained,
and returned into her aunt's hands the full sum she
had so involuntarily appropriated. Te only means
she could adopt demanded such a seemingly winter-
black period of self-denial, patience, and perseverance,
that at first, as Well represented and magnified all con-
acted with it, she felt as if indeed she could not nerve
herself for the task, much as she desired to perform it;
but prayer enabled her to face the idea, till it lost its
most painful aspect, and three months after Edward's
departure she comnencel the undertaking, resolved
that neither time nor difficulty should deter her from
its accomplishments. WHat her plan was, and whether
it succeeded, we may not here inform our rcaders.

Greatly to Caroline's delight, the following October
was fixed for them to lease Oakwood, and, after a
pleasant tour, to make the long anticipated visit to
London. There would then be three or four months quiet
for her to have the benefit of masters, before she was
introduced, and MRs. Milton fondly hoped, that the
Last year's residence at home, draught as it had
been with so much of domestic trial, and displaying
so many honeful and admirable traits in Caroline's
disposition, would hae lessened the danger of the
ordeal of admiration and gaiety which she so

page 'ill disclose.
1o Emmeline this arrangement was a source of ex-

It was again the 7th of June, and Ellen's birth-
day. Accustomed from the time she became an image
of Oakwood to regard the anniversary of her birth in
the same serious light as MRs. Milton had taught
her cousins-as a day of quiet reflection, as well as of
thankfulness and joy, as one that closing and recom-
mencing another year of their individual lives, taught
them that they were becoming more and more responsible
beings-it was not much wonder that Ellen the whole
of that day should seem somewhat less cheerful than
usual. She had indeed had many source of thankful-
ness and joy during the past year, but a heart and
mind like hers could not recall its principal event with-
out a return of sorrow. Mrs. IInmilton would not
notice her now unusual sadness until the evening, when
perceiving her standing engrossed in thought beside
one of the widely-opened windows, ear which Caroline
was watering some lovely flowers on the terrace, she
gently approached her, and, putting her arm round her,
said, fondly-

more such very silent meditations. that there is some-
thing to regret in the retrospect of the last year, I

her fondly. `I hope I shall never be caught in a net,
nor exposed to such horrors and danger as poor Madame

worry you; but believe me, when I assure you that folle-

I would bring it to you myself.''
Any other time I would punish your constant

Ellen had placed in MRs. Lnngford's hands, and never
had had the courage to inquire for, and the few her

much security dwelt in it.  Mamma, make her put

Zenobia did in her golden chains.''
 I think you might find prettier single, Emmeline,''
replied Mrs. IIamilton, smiling, as she granted her
request, by throwing the chain round Ellen's neck, and
fastening the bracelets on her wrists.
