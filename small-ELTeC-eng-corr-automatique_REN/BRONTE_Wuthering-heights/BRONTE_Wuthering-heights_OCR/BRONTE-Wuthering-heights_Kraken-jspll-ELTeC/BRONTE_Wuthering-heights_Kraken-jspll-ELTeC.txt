excessive slant of a few, stuntel firs at the
end of the house; and by a range of gaunt
thorns all stretching their limbs one way, as
if craving alms of the sun. Happily, the ar-

and the corners defended with large jutting

YEstERDAY afternoon set in misty and cold. I
had half a mind to spend it by my study
fire, instead of wading through heath and mud
to Wuthering Heights.

brushes, and coal-scuttle; and raising an in-

heaps of cinders. This spectacle drove me
back immediately; I took my hat, and, after a
four miles walk, arrived at Ileatheliff's garden
gate just in time to escape the first feathery
flakes of a snow shiver.
On that bleak hill to the earth was hard
with a black frost, and the air made me shiver
through every limb. Being unable to remove
the chain, I jumped over, and, running up the
flagged causeway bordered with straggling
gooseberry bushes, knocked vainly for admit-

howled.

the handle to essay another trial; when a

hailed me to follow him, and, after marching

at length arrived in the large, warm, cheerful

It glowed delightfully in the radiance of an
immense fire, compounded of coal, seat, and
wood: and near the table, laid for a plentiful
evening meal, I was pleased to observe the

never previously suspected.

rising and reaching from the chimney piece two
of the painted canisters.
Her position before was sheltered from the

whole figure and countenance. She was slender,
and apparently scarcely past girlhood: an ad-

that I have ever had the pleasure of behold-
ing : small features, very fair; flaxen ringlets,
or rather golden, hanging loose on her delicate
neck; and eyes-had they been agreeable in
expression, they would have been irresistible-
fortunately for my susceptible heart, the only
sentiment they evinced hovered between scorn
and a kind of desperation, singularly unnatural
to be detected there.
The banisters were almost out of her reach;
I made a motion to aid her; she turned upon
me as a miser might turn, if any one at-
tempted to assist him in counting his gold

proper person to ask me.'
She flung the tea back, spoon and all; and
resumed her chair in a, pet, her forehead for-
granted, and her red under-lip pushed out,
like a child's, ready to cry.
Meanwhile, the young man had slung on
his person a decidedly shabby upper garment,
and, erecting himself before the blaze, looked
down on me, from the corner of his eyes, for
all the world as if there were some mortal
feud unavenged between us. I began to doubt

In the absence of clear proofs of his con-

afterwards, the entrance of Heathcliff relieved
me, in some measure, from my uncomfortable

When the preparations were finished, he

we discussed our meal.
I thought, if I had caused the cloud, it was

was not. My neighbour struck me as for-

remarked, turning to my neighbour.
This was worse than before: the youth grew
crimson, and clenched his feet with every a-

smothered the storm in a brutal curse, muttered
on my behalf, which, however, I took care not

He fixed his eye on me longer than I cared

 How must I do?'' I continued, with rising
irritation.
There was no reply to my question; and,
on looking round, I saw only Joseph bringing
in a pail of porridge for the dogs:; and Mrs.

had fallen from the chimney-piece as the re-

WIth these words she suddenly splasheda

his accidental merriment expiring quickly in
his habitual moroseness.
I was sick exceedingly, and dizzy and faint;

of old-fashioned couch, very conveniently de

In fact, it formed a little closet, and the ledge
of a window, which it enclosed, served as a
table.
I laid back the panelled sides, got in with
my light, pulled then together again, and felt
secure against the vigilance of Heathcliff, and
every one else.
The ledge, where I placed my cuadle, had a
few mildewed books piled up in one corner
and it was covered with writing scratched on
the paint. This writing, however, was nothing
but a name repeated in all kinds of characters,

In vapid listlessness I leant my head against

minutes when a glare of white letters started
from the dark, as vivid as spectres-the air
swarmed with Catherine; and rousing myself
to dispels the obtrusive name, I discovered my
candle wick reclining on one of the antique
volumes, and perfuming the place with an
odour of rested calf-skin.
I snuffed it off, and, very ill at ease, under
the influence of cold and lingering nausea, sat

I shut it, and took up another, and another,

was select; and its state of lilapidation proved
it to have been well used, though not altogether
for a legitimate purpose; scarcely one chapter
had escaped a pen and ink commentary, at
least, the appearance of one, covering every
morsel of blank that the printer had left.
Some were detached sentences; other party
took the form of a regular diary, scraled in
an unfored, childish hand. At the top of an
extra page, quite a treasure probably when

an excellent caricature of my friend Joseph,
rudely yet powerfully sketched.

the unknown Catherine, and I began, forth-

deep in our road; and, as to floundered on,

For a moment I considered it absurd that I

into my own residence. Then, a new idea
flashed across me. I was not going there; we

Branderham preach from the text-'` Seventy

We crowded round, and, over Miss Death's

saw him wronged.
He seemed a sullen, patient child; hardened,
perhaps, to ill-treatment: he would stand
Linley's blows without winking or shedding
a tear, and my riches moved him only to
draw in a breath, and open his eyes as if he

I hoped heartily we should have peace now.

in, and laughing everybody who would not do
the same. A wild, wick slip she was-but,
she had the bonnet eye, and sweetest smile,
and lightest foot in the parish; and, after all,
I believe she meant no harm; for when once
she made you cry in good earnest, it seldom
happened that she would not keep you come-

She was much too fond of Ieatheli. The

greatest punishment we could invent for her
was to keep her separate from him: yet, she
got chided more than any of us on his account.
In play, she liked, exceedingly, to get the
little mistress; using her hands freely, and come-
handing her companions: she did so to me,
but I would not bear leaping, and ordering:
and so I let her know.
Now, Mr. Earnshaw did not understand
jokes from his children: he had always been
strict and grave with them; and Catherine, on
her part, had no idea why her father should be
crosser and less patient in his ailing condition,
than he was in his prime.
His peevish reproofs wakened in her a
naughty delight to provoke him; the was never

rue that we ever reared thee''
That made her cry, at first; and then, being
repulsed continually hardened her, and she
laughed if I told her to say she was sorry for
her faults, and beg to be forgiven.
But the hour came, at last, that ended Mr.
Earnshaw's troubles on earth. He died
quietly in his chair one Ootober evening, seated
by the fire-side.
A high wind clustered round the house, and
roared in the chimney: it sounded wild and

made her still; she leant against her father's
knee, and Hentholiff was lying on the floor
with his head in her lap.
I remember the master, before he fell into
doze, stroking her conny hair-it pleased him
rarely to see her gentle-and saying-

I joined my wail to theirs, loud and bitter;
but Joseph asked what we could be thinking
of to roar in that way over a saint in Heaven.
He told me to put on my cloak and run to

could not guess the use that either would be
of, then. However, I went, through wind and
rain, and brought one, the doctor, back with
me; the other said he would come in the
morning.
Leaving oseph to explain matter, I ran
to the children's room; their door was ajar, I
saw they had never laid down, though it was
at midnight; but they were calmer, and did
not need me to colonel them. The little souls
were comforting each other with better
thoughts than I could have hit on; no parson
in the world ever pictured Heaven so beauty-

In. HonEY came home to the funeral; and
-a thing that amazed us, and set the leigh-

wife with him.
WHat she was, and where she was born he
never informed us; probably, she bad neither
money nor name to recommend her, or he

the preparing for the burial, and the presence
of the mourners..
I thought she was half silly from her be-
haviour while that went on; she ran into her
chamber, and made me come with her, though
I should have been dressing the children; and
there she sat shivering and clasping her hands,
and asking repeatedly-
t Are they gone yet ?'
Then she began describing with hysterical
emotion the effect it produced on her to see
black; and started, and trembled, and, at last,
fell a weeping-and when I asked what was
the matter' answered, she didn't know; but
she felt so afraid of dying.
I imagined her as little likely to die as my-
self. She was rather thin, but young, and
fresh comnplexioned, and her eyes sparkled us

that mounting the stairs made her breathe very
quick, that the least sudden noise set her all in

symptoms portended, and had no impulse to
sympathize with her. We don't in general

Young Earnshaws was altered considerably in
the three years of his absence. He had grown
spare, and lost his colour, and spoke and
dressed quite differently: and, on the very day
of his return, he told Joseph and me we must
therefore th quarter ourselves in the back- kit-

he would have carpeted and paper a small

She expressed pleasure, to, nt finding a

prattled to Catherine, and kissed her, and ran
about with her, and gave her quantities of

tired very soon, however, and when she grew
peevish, Kindly became tyranniol. A few
words from her, evening a dislike to Heath-
cliff, were enough to rouse in him all his old
hatred of the boy. He drove him from their
company to the servants, deprived him of the
instructions of the curate, and insisted that he
should labour out of doors instead, compelling
him to do so, as hard as any other lad on the
farm.
He bore his degradation petty well at first,

She lifted a mouthful to her lips; then, she

I could not half tell what an infernal house
we had. The curate dropped calling, and no-
body decent came near us, at last; unless,
Edgar Lion's vi-its to Miss They might
be an exception. At fifteen she was the
queen of the country-side; she had no peer:
and she did turn out a haughty, headstrong
creature I own I did not like her, after her
infancy was past; and I vexed her frequently
y trying to bring down hoer arrogance; she
never took an aversion to me though. She
had a wondrous constance to old attachment;
even Heathcliff kept his hold on her affections
unalterahly, and young London, with all his
superiority, found it difficult to make an
equally deep impression.
He was my late master; that is his portrait
over the fireplace. It used to hang on one

test, she imposed unwittingly on the old lady
and gentleman, by her ingenious cordiality;
gained the admiration of Isnbella, and the
heart and soul of her brother-acquisitions
that flattered her from the first, for she was
full of ambition-and led her to adopt a double
character without exactly intending to deceive
anyone.
In the place where she heard Heathcliff
termed a `` vulgar young ruffian,'' and ` worse
than a brute,'' she took care not to let like
him; but at home she had small inclination to
practise politeness that would only be laughed

would bring her neither credit, nor praise.

appearance there was distasteful to Catherine;
she was not artful, never played the coquette,
and had evidently an objection to her two
friends meeting at all: for when Hleathcliff
expressed contempt of' London, in his presence,
she could not half coincide, as she did in his
absence; and when Into evinced disgust,
and antipathy to Hlentheliff, she dare not treat
his sentiments with indifference, as if deep-

consequence to her.

In the first place, he had, by that time, lost

books, or learning. His childhood's sense of
superiority, instilled into him by the favours
of old MIr. Earnshaw, was faded away. He
struggled long to keep up an equality with
Catherine in her studies and yielded with
poignant though silent regret: but, he yielded
completely; and there was no prevailing on

pleasure, apparently, in exciting the aversion

Catherine and he were constant companions
still, at his seasons of respite from labour; but,
he had ceased to express his fondness for her
in words, and recoiled with angry suspicion
from her girlish caresses, as if conscious there
would be no gratification in lavishing such
marks of affection on him. On the before-

whose flushed cheeks betrayed signs of warm

she sprang forward, took both his hands, and

about the period that my narrative has reached
-a bright, frosty afternoon; the ground bare,
and the road hard and dry.
I came to a stone where the highway
branches off on to the door at your left hand;
a rough sand-pillar, with the letters W. I.

the south-west, T. G. It serves as guide-post

The sun shone yellow on its grey head, re-
minding me of summer; and I cannot say
why, but all at once, a gush of child's sense-
tions flowed into my heart. Kindly and I
held it a favourite spot twenty years before.
I gaze long at the weather-worn block;
and, stooping down, perceived a hole near the
bottom still full of snail-shells and pebbles
which we were fond of storing there with
more pecrishable things-and, as fresh as red-

and conquered the worst shock of what was
denominated n brain fever. No mother could
hae nursed an only child more devotedly than
Edgar tended her. Day and night, he was
watching, and patiently enduring all the an-
annoyance that irritable nerves and a shaken
reason could inflict: and, though Beneath re-

would only recompense his ears by forming
the source of constant future anxiety, in fact,
that his health and strength were being said-
fixed to preserve a more ruin of humanity, he
knew no limits in gratitude and boy, when
Catherine's life was declared one of danger;
and hour after hour, he would sit beside her,
tracing the gradual return to bodily health,
and flattering his too sanguine hopes with the
illusion that her mind would settle back to its

The first time she left her chamber, was at
the commencement of the following March,
MIr. London had put on her pillow, in the

eye, long stranger to any gleam of pleasure,
caught them in waking, and shone delighted as
she gathered them eagerly together.

 The snow is quite gone; down here, day-

WHo knew she was really better, and there-
fore, decided that long confinement to a single
place produced much of this despondency, and
it might be partially removed by a change of
one.
The master told me to light a fire in the
many-week's deserted parlour, and to set an
easy-chair in the sunshine by the window;
and then he brought her down, and she sat a
long while enjoying the genial heat, and, as
we expected, revived by the objects round her,
which, though familiar, were free from the
dreary associations insulting her hated sick-
chamber. By evening, she seemed greatly ex-
haunted; yet no arguments could persuade her
to return to that apartment, and I had to a-
range the parlour sofa for her bed, till another
room could be prepared.
To obviate the fatigue of mounting and de-
spending the stairs, we fitted up this, where

parlour: and she was soon strong enough to

Ah, I thought myself, she might recover,
Be waited on as she was. And there was you-

ended that of another; we cherished the hope
that in a little while, MIr. Lion's heart would
be gladdened, and his lands secured from a
stranger's ripe, by the birth of an heir.
I should mention that Isabella sent to her
brother, same six weeks from her departure a
short note, announcing her marriage with
Heathecliff. It appeared dry and cold; but at
the bottom, was dotted in with pencil, an of-
sure apology, and an entreaty for kind three-
brain, and reconciliation, if her proceeding
had offended him; asserting that she could not
help it then, and being done, she had now no
power to reveal it.
Into did not reply to this, I believe; and,
in a fortnight more, I got a long letter which
I considered odd coming iron the pen of a

elevate his torch to a level with my face, squint

CHAPTER XIV.
As soon as I had perused this epistle, I went to
the master, and informed him that his sister
had arrived at the Heights, and sent me a
a letter expressing her morrow for Mrs. Into'a
situation, and her ardent desire to see him;
with a wish that he would transmit to her, as
early as possible, some token of forgiveness by
me.
 Forgiveness ' said Into.  I have
nothing to forgive her, Ellen-you may call at
Wuthering Heights this afternoon, if unlike,

and say that lIE am not angry, but Am sorry to
have lost her: especially as i can never think
she'll be happy. It is out of the question my
going to see her, however; we are eternally
divided; and should she really wish to oblige
me, let her persuade the villain she has a-
red to leave the country.''
And you wont write her a little note,
sir2'' I asked, imploringly.
 No,'' no answered.  It is needless. My
communication with Heathcliff'a family shall
be as spring as his with mine. It shall not
exist 
MIr. EDgar's coldness depressed me exceed-
ingly; and all the way from the Range, I
puzzled my brains how to put more heart into
what he said, when I repeated it; and how to
soften his refusal of even a few lines to con-
sole Ieabella.
I dare say she had been on that watch for
me since morning: lI saw her looking through
the lattice, as I came up the garden causeway

and I nodded to her; but she drew back, as if
afraid of being observed.
I entered without knocking. There never
was such a dreary, dismal scene as the formerly
cheerful house presented1 I must confess
that, if I had been in the young lady place,
I would, at least, have swept the hearth, and
wiped the tables with a duster. But she al-
ready cartoon of the pervading spirit of neglect
which encompassed her. Her pretty face was
wan and listless; her hair uncurled; some
locks longing blankly now, and some care-
less twisted round her head. Probably she
had not touched her dress since yester evening.
Whindale was not there. Mr. Heathcliff sat
at a table, turning over some papers in his
pocket-book ; but he rose when I appeared,
asked me how I did, quite friendly, and offered
me a chair.

stranger as a born and bred gentleman, and his
wife as a thorough little slatternl
She came forward eagerly to greet me; and
held out one hand to take the expected letter.
I shook my head. She would't under-

Oh, I have nothing,'' I replied, thinking
it best to speak the truth at once.  My
master bid e tell his sister that she must not
expect either a letter or a visit from him at
present. He sends his love, ma'am, and his

that after this time, his household, and the
household here, should drop intercommunica-
lion; as nothing good could come of keeping
it up.
Mrs. Ienthcliff's lip quivered slightly, and
she returned to her seat in the window. 1her
husband took his stand on the hearthstone,
near me, and began to put questions concern-
ing Catherine.
I told him as much as I thought proper of
her illness, and he extorted from me, by cross-
examination, most of the facts connected with
its origin.
I blamed her, as she deserved, for bringing
it all on herself; and ended by hoping that he
would follow MIr. Lion's example, and avoid
future interference with his family, for good or
evil.

ANoTHER week over- and I am so many day
nearer health, and spring I have now heard
all my neighbour's history, at different sitting
as the housekeeper could spare time from more
important occupations. I'll continue it in he

on the whole, a very fair narrator and I don't
think I could improve her style.

In the evening,'' she said, `' the evening
of my visit to the Heights, I knew as well as
if I saw him, that MIr. IIeathclif was about
the place; and I shunned going out, because 1
still carried his letter in my pocket, and didn't
want to be threatened, or teased any more.
I had made up my mind not to give it till
my master went somewhere; as I could not
guess how its receipt would affect Catherine.
The consequence was, that it did not reach
her before the lapse of three days. The fourth

after the family were gone to church.
There was a man servant left to keep the
house with me, and we generally made a pray-
time of locking the doors during the hours of
service; but on that occasion, the weather was
so warm and pleasant that I set them wide
open; and to fulfil my engagement, as i knew
he would be coming, I told my companion
that the mistress wished very much for some
orange, and he must run over to the village,

and get a few, to be paid for on the morrow.
He departed, and I went up-stairs.
Mrs. Into sat in a loose, white dress,
with a light shawl over her shoulders, in the
recess of the open window, as usual. Her
thick, long hair had been partly removed at
the beginning of her illness: and now, she
wore it simply combed in its natural tresscs
over her temples and neck. Her appearance
was altered, as i had told Heathcliff, but when
she was calm, there seemed unearthly beauty
in the change.
The flash of her eyes had been succeeded by
a dreamy and melancholy softness: they no
longer gave the impression of looking at the
objects around her; they appeared always to
gaze beyond, and far beyond-you would have
said out of this world-Then, the paleness of
her face, its haggard aspect having laughed

the touching interest, which she wakened, and
invariably to me, I know, and to any person
who saw her, I should think, refuted more tan-

as one doomed to decay.
A book last spread on the sill before her, and
the scarcely perceptible wind fluttered it

divert herself with reading, or occupation of
any kind; and he would spend many an hour

She was conscious of his aim, and in her
better moods, endured his efforts placidly; only
slowing their uselessness by now and then
uppressing a wearied sigh, and cheeking him
at last, with the saddest of smiles and kisses.
At other times, she would turn petulantly
away, and hide cr face in her hands, or even
push him off angrily; and then he took care
to let her alone, for he was certain of doing
no good.
wTIIERING HEICITTFE,
Gimmerton chapel bells were still ringing
and the full, mellow flow of the beck in the
valley, came soothingly on the ear. It was

mentioned before, which expressed no recognise-
lion of material things either by ear or eye.

said, gently answering it in one hand that rested
on her knee. e You must read it medium-

There was a start, and a troubled gleam of
recollection, and a struggle to arrange her
ideas. She lifted the letter, and seemed to

she sighed; yet still I found she had not
gathered its import; for upon my desiring to
hear her reply she merely pointed to the
name, and gazed at me with mournful and
questioning eagerness.

the sunny grass beneath, raise its ears, as if

Mrs. Into bent forward, and listened
breathlessly. The minute after a step try-
versed the hall; the open house was too
tempting for Heatheliff to resist walking in:
most likely he supposed that I was inclined to
shirk my promise, and so resolved to trust to his
own audacity.
With straining eagerness Catherine gazed
towards the entrance of her chamber. He did
not hit the right room directly; she motioned
me to admit him; but he found it out, ere 1
could reach the door, and in a stride or two

The two, to a cool spectator, made a strange

Heatheliff went to the back of her chair,
and leant over, but not so far as to let her see
his face, which was livid with emotion. She

herself on the arm of the chair. At that
earnest appeal, he turned to her, looking at-
absolutely desperate. His eyes wide, and wet,
at last, flashed fiercely on her; his breast
heaved convulsively. An instant they held

seemed directly insensible. THe flung himself
into the nearest seat, and on my approaching
hurriedly to ascertain if she had fainted, he
guashed at me, and foamed like a mad dog
and gathered her to him with greedy jealousy.
I did not feel as if I were in the company of a
creature of my own species; it appeared that
he would not understand, though I spoke to
him; so, I stood off, and held my tongue, in
a94t perplexity.
A movement of Catherine's relieved me a
little presently: she put up her hand to clasp
his neck, and bring her cheek to his, as he held
her: while he, in return, covering her with
frantic caresses, said wildly-

OuT twelve o'clock, that night, was born
the Catherine you saw at Wuthering Heights,
a puny, seven months' child; and two hours
after the mother died, having never recovered
sufficient consciousness to miss Heatheliff, or
know Edgar.
The latter's distraction at his bereavement

after effects showed how deep the sorrow sunk.
A great addition, in my eyes, was his being

motive was seeing Mr. Heatheliff. If he had
remained among the larches all night he would
have heard nothing of the stir at the Range,
unless, perhaps, he might catch te gallop of

had come nearer he would probably be aware,
from the lights flitting to and fro, and the open-

sensitive was his aversion, that he refrained
from going anywhere where he was likely to
see or hear of Heathcliff. Grief, and that to-
gather, transformed him into a complete her-
it: he threw up his office of magistrate,
ceased even to attend church, avoided the evil-
late on all occasions, and spent a life of entire
seclusion within the limits of his park and
grounds: only varied by solitary rambles on
the moors, and visits to the grave of his wife,
mostly at evening, or early morning, before
other wanderers were abroad.
But he was too good to be thoroughly un-
happy long. He didn't pray for Catherine's
soul to haunt him: Time brought resig-

bent, tender love, and hopeful aspiring to the
better world, where, he doubted not she was

so opposite in similar circumstances. They

He took her education entirely on himself,

him to come to her, if possible, for she had

The summer shone in full prime; and she

I could scarcely refrain from smiling at this
antipathy to the poor fellow; who was a well-

rabbits and game. Still, I thought I could

A .TrEE, edged with black, announced the
day of my master's return. Isabella was dead:
and he wrote to bid me get mourning for his
daughter, and arrange a room, and other a-

Catherine ran wild with joy at the idea of
welcoming her father back: and indulged
most sanguine anticipations of the innumera-

The evening of their expected arrival come.
Since early morning, she had been busy, or-

in her new black frock-poor thing her
aunt's death impressed her with no definite
sorrow-she obliged me, by constant worrying,
to walk with her, down through the grounds, to
meet them.

rolled in sight.

arm, as soon as she caught her father's face,
looking from the window. He descended,
nearly as eager as herself; and a considerable
interval elapsed, ere they had a thought to
spare for any but themselves.
Will they exchanged caresses, I took a
peep in to see after Into. He as asleep,

Into never had.
The latter saw me looking; and having
shaken hands, advised me to close the door,
and leave him undisturbed; for the journey
had fatigued him.
They would fain have taken one glance;
but her father told her to come on, and they
walked together up the park, while I hastened
before, to prepare the servants

The carriage stopped; and the sleeper,
being roused, was lifted to the ground by his
uncle.
 This is your cousin They, London,'' he
said, putting their little hands together.
 She's fond of you already; and mind you
don't grieve her by crying te-night. Try to be
cheerful now; te travelling is at an end, and

All three entered, and mounted to the library

I proceeded to remove Lion's cap, and

lightened into a faint smile.
 Oh, hell do very well,'' said the master to
me, after watching them a minute.  Very
well, if we can keep him, Ellen. The company
of a child of his own age will instil new spirit
into him soon: and by wishing for strength

when a maid stepped out of the kitchen, and
informed me that Mr. Hentheliff's servant,
Joseph, was at the door, and wished to speak
with the master.
I shall ask him what he wants first,'' I said,
in considerable trepidation.  A very unlikely
hour to be troubling people, and the instant
they have returned from a long journey. I don't
think the master can see him.,''
Joseph had advanced through the kitchen,
as I uttered these words, and now present-

Sunday garments, with his most sanctimonious
and sourest face; and holding his hat in one
hand, and his stick in the other, he proceeded
to lean his shoes on the mat
 Good evening, Joseph,'' I said, coldly.

surveying the range of closed doors.
I perceive he was bent on refusing my me-
action; so very reluctantly, I went up to the
library, and announced the unseasonable visit-
her; advising that he should be dismissed till
next day.
MIr. London had no time to empower me to
do so, for he mounted close at my heels, and
pushing into the apartment, planted himself
at the far side of the table, with his two fiste
clasped on the head of his stick, and began in
an elevated tone, as if anticipating opposition.

her commendation of him to his care, he
grieved bitterly at the prospect of yielding
him up, and searched in his heart how it might
be avoided. No plan offered itself': the very
exhibition of any desire to keep him would
have rendered the climate more peremptory:
there was nothing left but to resign him.
However, he was not going to rouse him from
his sleep.

said he-
 As we shall not have no influence over

London was very reluctant to be roused
from his bed, at five o'clock, and astonished
to be informed that he must prepare for fur-

by stating that he was going to spend some
time with his father, Mr. Heathcliff, who
wished to see him so much, he did not like to
defer the pleasure till he should recover from
his late journey.

 It lies a little distance from the

 He had business to keep him in the

required her to reside in the south.''

WAs had sad work with little They that day:
she rose in high glee, eager to join her cousin:
and such passionate tears and lamentations
followed the news of his departure, that Red-
far, himself, was obliged to soothe her, by a-
forming he should come back soon; he added,
however,  if I can get him;'' and there were
no hopes of that.
This promise poorly pacified her; but time
was more potent; and though still, at inter-
vale, she inquired of her father, when Into

would return; before she did see him again,
his features had waxed so dim in her memory
that she did not recognise him.
When I chanced to encounter the house-
keeper of Wuthering HEIghts, in paying busy-
ness-visits to Gimmerton, I used to ask how
the young master got on; for he lived almost
as secluded as Catherine herself, and was never
to be seen. I could gather from her that he
continued in weak health, and was a tiresome
inmate. She said MIr. Heathcliff' seemed to
dislike him ever longer and worse, though he
took some trouble to conceal it. DIe hal an
antipathy to the sound of his voice, and could
not do at all with his sitting in the same room
with him many minutes together.
There seldom passed much talk between
them; Into leant his lessons, and spent hi
evenings in a small apartment, they called the
parlour; or else lay in bed all day; for he
was constantly getting coughs, and cold, and
aches, and pains of some sort.

And I never knew such a faint-hearted
creature,'' added the woman;``nor one so

the window open, a bit late in the evening
Oh t's killing a breath of night aisle And
he must have a fire in the middle of summer:
and Joseph's 'bacca pipe is poison; and he
must always have sweets and painters, and
always milk, milk for ever-heeding naught
how the rest of us are pinched in winter-and
there he'll sit, wrapped in his furred cloak in
his chair by the fire, and some toast and water,
or other slop on the hob to sip at; and if
Harden, for pity, comes to amuse him-Glare-
ton is not bad-natured, though he's rough-
they're sure to part, one swearing, and the
other trying. I believe the master would re-
list Earnshaw's thrashing him to a mummy, if
he were not his son: and, I'm certain, he
would be fit to turn him out of doors, if he
knew half the nursing he gives hissecln. But
then, he wont go into danger of temptation:

he never enters the parlour, and should Into
show those ways in the house here he is, he
ends him up stairs directly.''
I divined, from this account, that utter lack
of sympathy had rendered young Heatheliff
selfish and disagreeable, if he were not a
originally; and my interest in him, conse-
gently, delayed; though still I was moved
with a sense of grief at his lot, and a wish
that he had been left with us.
Mr. Edgar encouraged me to gain inform-
lion; he thought a great deal about hi, I
fancy, and would have run some risks to see
him; and he told me once to ask the house-
keeper whether he ever came into the village'
She said he he only been twice, on horse-
back, accompanying his father: and both times
he pretended to be quite knocked up for three
or four days afterwards.
That housekeeper left, if I recollect rightly,

Time wore on at the Range in its fore

On the anniversary of her birth we never
manifested any signs of rejoicing, because it
was, also, the anniversary of my late mistress's
death. Her father invariably spent that day
alone in the library; and walked, at dusk, a
far as Gimmerton kirkyard, where he would
frequently prolong his stay beyond midnight.
Therefore Catherine was thrown on her own
resources for amusement.
This twentieth of March as a beautiful
spring day, and when her father had retired,
my young lady came down dressed for going
out, and said she had asked to have a ramble
on the edge of the moors with me; and MIr.
London had given her leave, if we went only a
short distance, and were back within the hour.
 So make haste, Ellen' she cried. 1

 No, it's not,'' she said.  Ve gone very

I put on my bonnet, and sallied out;
thinking nothing more of the matter. She
bounded before me, and returned to my side,
and was off again like a young greyhounl;
and, at first, I found plenty of entertainment
in listening to the larks singing far and near;
and enjoying the sweet, warm sunshine; and
watching her, my pet, and my delight, with
her golden ringlets flying loose behind, and her
bright cheek, as soft and pure in its bloom,
as a wild rose, and her eyes radiant with
cloudless pleasure. She was a happy creature.
and an angel, in those days. It's a pity she

But term were so many hillocks and banks
to climb and pass, that, at length, I began to be
weary, and told her we must halt, and retrace
our steps
I shouted to her, as she had outstripped me,
a long way; she either did not hear, or did not
regard, for she still sprang on, and I was come-
pulled to follow. finally, she dived into a
hollow; and before I came in sight of her
again, she was two miles nearer Wuthering
Things that her own home; and I bEheld a
couple of persons arrest her, one of whom I

They had been caught in the fact of plan-

The Heights were Heathcliff's land, and he
was reproving the poacher.

said, as I toiled to them, expanding her hand
in corroboration of the statement.  I didn't
mean to take them; but papa told me there
were quantities up here, and I wished to see
the eggs.''
Heatheliff glanced at me with an ill-mean-

party, and, consequently, his malevolence to
wards it, and demanded who ``papa'' was?
 MIr. Notion of Thrushcross Range,'' she
replied.  I thought you did not know me,

 You suppose papa is highly esteemed and

She pointed to Sharpen, the other divine-

rough as ever.

Heathliff pushing me aside.  But I have

you and she would be the better for a little
rest. Will you just turn this nab of heath,

any account, accede to the proposal; it was

he had seized; but she was almost at the door-

full speed. Her appointed companion did not
pretend to escort her; he shed off by the road

` And In resolved she shall never approach

us up the path, hastened to penitent door. My

She also got a trick of coming down early
in the morning, and lingering about the kit-
then, as if she were expecting the arrival of
something; and she had a well drawer in a
cabinet in the library which she would trifle
over for hours, and whose key she took special
care to remove when she left it.
One day, as he inspected this drawer, I of-
served that the play-things, and trinkets which
recently forced its contents, were transmuted
into bits of folded paper.
My curiosity and suspicions were roused; I
determined to take a peep at her mysterious
treasures; so, at night, as soon as she and my
master were safe up stairs, I searched and red-
daily found among my house keys, one that
would fit the look. Having opened, I emptied
the whole contents into my apron, and took
them with me to examine at leisure in my on
chamber.
Though I could not but suppose, I was still
surprised to discover that they were a mass of

nearly without intermission.
Poor They, frightened from her little to-

I esteemet it a duty tu supply its look, as
much as possible, with mine; an inefficient
substitute, for I could only spare two or three
hours, from my numerous diurnal occupations,
to follow her footsteps. and then, my society
was obviously less desirable than his.

to accompany her on a stroll to the bottom of
the park; a formal walk which she generally
affected if low-spirited; and that she inward-
able was when MIr. Edgar had been worse than
ordinary; a thing never known from his con-
passion, but guessed both by her and me from
his increased silence, and the melancholy of
his countenance.
She went sadly on; there was no running
or bounding now:; though the chill wind might
well have tempted her to a race. And often,
from the side of my eye, I could detect her
raising a hand, and brushing something of her
cheek.
I gazed round for a means of diverting her
thoughts. On one side of the road rose a
high, rough bank, where hazels and stunted
oaks, with their roots half exposed, held un-
certain tenour: the soil was too loose for the
latter; and strong winds had blown some
nearly horizontal. In summer, Miss Catherine

in the branches, swinging twenty feet above

and her light, childish heart, still considered
it proper to scold every time I caught her at
such an elevation; but so that she knew there
was no necessity for descending. From dinner
to tea she would lie in her breeze-roeked

to gather some hips that bloomed stole on the
summit branches of the wild rose trees, she-

In stretching to pull them, her hat fell off;
and as the door was locked, she proposed
scrambling own to recover it. I bid her be
cautious lest so got a fall, and she nimhly dis-
appeared.
But the return was no such easy matter; the
stones were smooth and neatly consented, and
the rosebushos, and blackberry stragglers could
yield no assistance in re-ascending. I, like a

on the first occasion of my sitting up in the

to walk about the garden, for refreshment. I
did detect a figure creeping along the inner

The man took his charge stealthily across

by the casement-window of the drawing-room,
and glided noiselessly up to where I awaited

She put the door gently to, slipped off her
snowy shoes, united her hat, and was proceed-

myself. The surprise petrified her an instant:
she uttered an inarticulate exclamation, and
stood fixed.

and i've never missed going a day since you
fell ill; except thrice before, and twice after
you left your room. I gave Michael books and
pictures to prepare Hamlin every evening, and
to put her back in the stable; you mustn't
scold him either, mind. I was at the Heights
by half-past six, and generally stayed till half-
past eight, and then gallopped home. It was
not to amuse myself that I went; I was often
wretched all the time. No and then, I was
happy, once in a weeks perhaps. At first, I
expected there would be sad work persuading
you tolet me keep my word to London, for I
had engaged to call again next day, when we
quitted him; but, as you stayed up stairs on
the morrow, I escaped that trouble; and while
MIchael was threatening the lock of the park
door in the afternoon, I got possession of the
key, and tell him how my cousin wished me
to visit him, because he was sick, and couldn't

with him about the pony. He is fond of read-
in, and he thinks of leaving soon to get mar-

I preferred giving him my own, and that satin-

mind dreamily about among the bloom, and
the larks singing high up over head, and the
blue sky, and bright sun shining steadily and
cloudless. That was his most perfect idea
of heaven's happiness-mine was rocking in n
rustling green tree, with a west wind blowing,
and bright, white clouds flitting rapidly
above; and not only larks, but throstles, and
blackbirds, and linnets, and cuckoos pouring
out music on every side, and the moors seen at
a distance, broken into cool dusky bells; but

should fall asleep in his, and he said he could
not breathe in mine, and began to grow very
snappishly. At last, we agreed to try both as
soon as the right weather came; and then we
kissed each other and were friends. After
sitting still an hour, I looked at the great
room with its smooth, uncarpeted floor; and
thought how nice it would be to play in, if we
removed the table; and I asked Listen to call
Villa in to help us-and we'd have a game at
blind-man's buff-she should try to catch us-

there was no pleasure in it, he said; but he
consented to play at all with me. WE found

as if he wanted me to speak to him. I only
told him to leave my horse alone, or else it
would kick him.

surveyed its legs with a smile.

of penning his peculiar personal sufferings, and

Into did not appear to remember what

His lack of interest in the subjects she started,
and his equal incapacity to contribute to her

not conceal her disappointment. An indefinite
alteration had come over his whole person and.

Catherine's face was just like the landscape

poor little heart reproached itself for even that
passing forgetfulness of its cares

Heathelif' had the key in his hand that re-

with a sort of surprise at her boldness, or,
possibly, reminded by her voice and glance, of
the person from whom she inherited it.
She snatched at the instrument, and half

fingers; but her action recalled him to the

Regardless of this warning, she captured
his closed hand, hands contents again.

Henthcliff glanced at me a glance that kept

me from interfering a moment. Catherine was
too intent on his fingers to notice his face. He
opened them, suddenly, and resigned the object
of dispute; but, ere she had well secured it,
he seized her with the deliberate hand, and,
pulling her on his knee, administered, with
the other, a shower of terrific alas on both
sides of the head, each sufficient to have ful-
filled his threat, had she been able to fall.
At this diabolical violence, I rushed on him
furiously.

with that and the rage, l staggered dizzily

They ran to me instead of London, and
knelt down, and put her burning cheek on my

into a corner of the settle, as quick as a mouse,

Catherine pushed another to him, and wiped
her face. I felt disgusted at the little wretch's
composure, since he was no longer in terror for
himself. The anguish he had exhibited on the
moor subsided as soon as ever he entered
Wuthering Heights; so, I guessed he had been
menaced with an awful visitation of wrath, if
he failed in decoying us there; all, that a-
couplished, he had no further im:cattle
fears.

tinued, after sippiag some of the liquid. ` And

We entered together; Catherine was there,
making herself useful in preparing some vege-

more sulky, and less spirited than when I had
seen her first. She hardly raised her eyes to
notice me, and continued her employment with
the same disregard to common forms of polite-

out the letter and flung it on the floor beside

would have called it, the younger doing his

afternoon, I was busy getting up linen in the

the window panes, rarying her amusement by
smothered bursts of songs, and whispered eja-

impatience in the direction of her cousin, who
steadfastly smoked, and looked into the grate.

 Catherine, by instinct, must have divined
it was moderate perversity, and not dislike,

remaining an instant, undecided, she stooped,
and impressed on his cheek a gentle kiss.
 The little rogue thought I had not seen

I shook my head reprovingly: and then
she blushed, and whispered-

 The intimacy, thus commenced, grew ra-

After breakfast, Catherine insisted on my

The following evening was very wet, indeed
