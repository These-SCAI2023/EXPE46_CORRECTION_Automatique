spite of these fields being flat, and low, ny, in spite of th

wealth, is struggling on for bread for his children, through
the vicissitudes of lowered wages, short hours fewer hands
employed, &c. And when he knows trade is bad, and could
understand (t least partially) that there are not buyers
enough in the market to purchase the goods already made,
and Consequently that there is no demand for more; when
he would bear and endure much without complaining, could
he also see that his employers were bearing their share; he is,
I say, bewildered and (to use his own word) ``granted''

Large houses are still occupied, while spinners' and weavers
cottages stand empty, because the families that one filled
them are obliged to live in rooms or collars. Carriages still
roll along the streets, concerts are still crowded hy suh-

customers, while the workman liters away his unemployed
time in watching these things, and thinking of the pale, nn-
complaining wife at home, and the wailing children asking in

Amy danced off into the conservatory which openend out
of the room, before the giant, pale, unwashed, nnshaven

his hair with old country hit, and every now and then steel-

engaged.
To when the funeral sy cme, Mrs. Davenport was neatly
arrayed in black, a satisfaction to her poor heart in the midst
ofhersorro. Barton and WiLson both accompanied her, as
she led her two elder boys, and followed the coffin. It was
simple walking funeral, with nothing to grate on the feeling
of any; far more in accordance with its purpose, to my mind,
than the gorgeous hearses, and nodding plumes, which form
the grotesque funeral pomp of respectable people. here
was no '`rattling the bones over the stones,'' of the paupers
funeral. Decently and quietly was he followed to the grave
by one determined to endure her woe meekly for his sake.
The only mark of superiors attendant on the burial con-
crowd the living and joyous, far more than the red, or the
zorrowful. When they arrived in the churchyard, they halted
befor a raised and handsome tombstone; in reality a wootaen
mockery of stone rerpectabilities which adorned the burial-
ground. It was easily rsisel in a very few minutes, and below
was the grave in which paper bodies were piled until within
a foot or two of the surface; when the soil was hollowed over
and stayed down, and the aden cover went to do tempo-
rary duty over another hole.' But little they rocked of this

Sally relinquished it unwillingly. She had, however,
the pleasure of seeing Mary dimple and blush as she read
the letter, which seemed to assay the water was not indifferent
to her.

her eyes at last. `I have said I won't meet him while father

a factory worker, listening outside, observed, ``She spun it

half the feeling she put into it that night, the lecturer must
have been hard to please, if he did not admit that his ex-
operations were more than fulfilled.
When it was ended, Mary's looks told more than words
could have done what she thought of it; and partly to keep
in a year which would fain have rolled out, she brightened into
 laugh, and said, `for certain, th' carriage is coming. So

doors; and there as an unusual silence of footsteps in the
little paved courts.
Mary had to change her Clothes after her walk home; and

But Mary would not let him so rest. he ran in and brought

rumtnsge up their little bit of provision while he changed by
the fire, talking all the while as gill as she could, though
her father'a depression hung like lel on her heart.
kFor Mary, in her seclusion at Miss Simmonds',- where

men, when they petition with all the force of their rough,
untutored words to le heard concerning the distress which

the people; which was crushing their lives out of them, and
stamping remarks over the land.

pretended to embrace self, at the expense of the misery, the
run, of one falsely termed beloved. She need not be pen-

I um obliged to you, Sir, for telling me what you have.
You may think I am a fool; but I did think yo meant to
marry me all along; and yet thinking so, I felt I could not
love you. Still felt so I had gone so far in keeping com-
many with you. Now, Sir, I tell you, if I had loved you before,
I don't think I should have love in now you have tool me
you meant to ruin me; for that's the plan English of not
meaning to marry me till jut this minute. I said I was sorry,
and humbly begged your pardon; that was before I knew
what you were. Now I acorn you, Sir, for plotting to ruina
pees girl. Good night.'
And with a wrench for which she had reserved all ler
strength, she lew off like a holt. They heard her flying foot-
steps echo down the quiet street. The next sound was Sully's
laugh, which grated on Mr. Parents' ears, and keenly irr
rated him.
And what do you find so amusing, Sally2'' asked he.
Oh, Sir, I beg your pardon. I humbly beg your pardon,
as Mary says, but I can't hel laughing, to think how she "s out-
witted us,'' (he was going to have said, ``outwitted yon,''
but change the pronoun.)
Why, Sally, hd you any idea she was going to fly out in
this style''
eNo, I hadn't to be sure. But you did think marrying
her, why (if may be so boll as to ask) did you go and tell her
you and no thought of doing otherwise by her2 That was
what put her up at last''
Why I had repeatedly before led her to infer that
marriage was not my object. I naver turned she could have
been a foolish as to have mistaken me, little provoking ro-
cancer though she bol So I actually wished her to know
what a sacrifice of prejudice, of-- of myself, in short, I was
willing to make for herself; yet I don't think she was aware
of it after all. I believe i might have any ldy in Manchester
15
if I liked, and yet I was willing and ready to marry s poor
dress-maker. Don't you understand one now and don't you
see what a sacrifice I was making to humour her? and all tono
avail.''
Sally was silent, so he went on:
My father would have forgiven any temporary con-
nein, tar sooner than my marrying one so far beneath me in
rank,''
i thought you said, Sir, your mother was a factory girl,''
reminded Sally, rather maliciously.
Yes, yes-but then my father was in much such a
station; at any rate, there was not the disparity there is be-
tween Mary and me.''
Another pae.
Then you mean to give her up, Sir. She made no bones
of saying she gae you up.''
No, I do not mean to give her up, whatever you and she
may please to think. I am more in love with her than ever;
even for this charming cnpricious ebullition of hers. She 's1
come round, you may depend upon it. Women always do.
They always have second thoughts, and find out that they are
best in casting off a lower. Mind I don't say I shall offer her
the same terms again.''
With a few more words of no importance, the allies
parted.

Whereupon she broke into a table wil of felt-reproach, that
her outward show of misery was not grenier; as if any cries, or
tens, or loud-spoken words could have told of such pangs at
the heart as that look, and that thin, piping, altered voice
But think of Mary and what she was enduring Picture to
yourself (for I cannot tell you) the armies of thoughts that met
and clashed in her brain; and then imagine the effort it cost her
to be calm, and quiet, and even in a faint way, cheerful and
smiling at tines.
After a while she began to stir about in her own mind for some
means of spring the poor mother the trial of appearing as a
witness in the matter of the gun. She had made no allusion ta
her summons this morning, and Mary almost thought she must
have forgotten it; and surely some means might he found to
nravaent that additional sorry. Bha must speech about it: easy,
if necessary, she must sse Me, Iridgenorth, with all his truth-

thess two last lays, hal ao concealed agony, an hidden her
inward woo anl bewilderment, that she began to the con-
friendee, and to have faith in her own powers of meetingany one
with a possibly fair show, whatever might be rending her life
beneath the cloak of her deception.
Accordingly, as soon as Mrs. Davenport came in after morn-
into church, to ask after the two lone women, in she had heard
the report Mary hm t ive (o much better as regarded Mrs.
Wilson than what they h genre the night before it would have
beon) -s soon as this kind-hearted, grateful woman cme in,
Mary, telling her her process, went off to fetch the doctor who
intended Alice.
He was shaking himself after his morning's round, and happy
in the anticipation of his unsy's dinner; but he was a good-
tempered man, who found it difficult to keep a i w

So quietly that it was unnatural under the circumstances. It

bodily illness could have done. If she had raved in delirium, or
moanl in favor, he would have spree after his wont, and given
his opinion, his advice and his consolation; now he was awed into
blanca.
At length he pulled Mary aside inte s corner of the house-
place where Mrs. Wilson was sitting, and began to talk to her.
Yo 'ra right, MoneY She 'a no ways fit to go to Liverpool,
poor soil. Now I 've seen her I only wonder the doctor could
ha' been unsettled in his mind at th' first. Choose how it goes
wi' poor em, she eannotgo. One way or another it will soon be
over, the best to leave her in the state she is till then,''
i was sure you would think so,'' said Mary.
But they are reckoning without their host. They esteemed
har senses gone, while in fact, they were only inert, and could
not convey impressions rapidly to the over-burdened, troubled
brain. They had not noticed that her eyes had followed them
(mechanically it seemed at first) as they had moved away to the
order of the room; that her face hitherto so careless, hd
barun to work with one or two of the old symptoms of im-
parties.
But when they were silent she stool u, and stalled them
almost as if a dead person had spoken, by saying clearly anl
decidedly --lI go t Liverpool. I hear you and your plans; and
I tell you I shall go to Liverpool. If my words are to kill my son,
they have already gone forth out of my mouth, and nought cnn

nationally heaving such keep oppressive sighs, as quite startled
those around her.

up and down, as of came in.

some kind-hearted lie which might soothe her for a time. But
now the real state of the case este blurring forth in answer to
her impatient questioning.
WiLl 's not to the fore. But he 'll may be turn up yet, time

He looked at him steadily for a minute, as if almost douhting
if such despair could he in store for her as his words seemed t
imply. Then she slowly shook her head, and said, more quietly
than might have been expected from her previous excited

And quietly, noiselesaly. Mary watched the unchanging
wethenr-cock through the night. He sat on the little window-
seat, her hand holding back the curtain which shaded the room
from the right moonlight without; her head resting its weariness
against the corner of the window-frame; her eyes burning, and
stiff with the intensity of her z.
The ruddy morning stole up the horizon, casting a crimson
glow into the watcher's room.
It was the morning of the day of trial

O ll the restless people who found that night's hors agony

was perhaps the most restless. He hsl slept bmt little since the
low had fallen; his waking hours had been to full of agitated
thought, which seemed to hunt and pursue him through his un-
diet slumbers.
And this night of all others was the most sleepless. He turned
over and over again in his mind the wonder if every thing hal
been done that could be one, to insure the conviction of ITem
Wilson. Almost regretted the haste with which he had urged
forward the proceedings, and yat until he had obtained ven-
glance, he felt as if there were no peace on earth for him (I don't
know that he exactly used the term vengeance in his thoughts: he
spoke of justice, and probably thought of his desired end e
such); no peace, either bodily or mental, for  eh

With daylight, increased power of action game; and he drove
off to arouse his attorney, and worry him with further directions

until the court should be opened, and the trial begin.
WVht were all the living, - wife or daughters,- what were

At nine o'clock they all met at their awful place of rendessoes.

Job Iegh, BEn Sturgis, and several others were there, amongst
whom was Charles Jones.
Job Leg had carefully avoided any questioning from Mrs.
Wilson that morning. Indeed he had not been much in her com-
many, for he had risen up early to go out once more to make in-
query for MAry; and when he could hear nothing of her, he had
desperately resolved not to deceive Mre. Wilson, ass sorry
never came too late; and if the blow were inevitable, it would
be better to leave her in ignorance of the impending evil as long
as possible. She took her place in the witness-room, win and
dispirited, but not anxious.

court, Mr. Bridgenorth's clerk bheckoned to him.

Suddenly she was roused, sho one not how or by what.
He was conscious that all was real, that hundreds were looking
t for, that true-sounding words were being extracted from her;
that that figure, so bowel down, with the free concealed with
both hands, was really Jem. TIer face flashed scarlet, and
then, paler than before. Glut in dress of herself, with the
tremendous secret imprisoned within her, she exerted eer

own her love. No, when the beloved stood ths, abhorred
of men, there would be no feminine shame to stand between her
and her vocal. So she also turned towards the judge, parts
to mark that her answer was not given to the monkeyfid man
who questioned her, and likewise that her face might be averted

the dead of the words he anticipated.

ware her.
Darling, it is; it 's no use hiding it- if you mean that. I 'm
no longer to work at Duncombe's foundry. It's no time (to my
mind) to have secrets from each other, though I did not name it
yesterday, thinking yo might fret. I shall soon get work again,
never fear.'
bUt why did they turn you off, when the jury had said you
were innocent?''
2I was not just to say tunnel of, though I don't think I could
have well said on. A good number of the men managed to get
out they should not like to work under me again; there were
some few who knew me well enough to feel I could not have done
it, but more were doubtful; nnl one spoke to young Mr. un

His exhaustion compelled him to sit down. Mary rushed to

presence.

He ceased, and there was a pause for a few seconds.
Then Mr. Carson turned to go. When his hand was on the
later of the door, he hesitated for an instant.
You can have no doubt for what purpose go. Straight to
the police-office, to send men to take care of you, wretched
man, and your accomplice. To-morrow morning your tale hall

hanging is.''
Oh, Girl'' said Mary, springing forward, and catching

hold of Mr. Canons' arm, ``my father is dying. Look at him,
Sir. If you want Death for Deth, you have it. Don't take
him away from me these inst hamas. He must go alone through

John himself stood up, asti and riggit, and replied,

He tried to shake off the spiritual impression made by this
imagination. He was feverish and ill,- and no wonder.
o he turned to go honewarde; not, as he had threatened,
to the police-office. After all (he toll himself), that would do
in the morning. No fear of the men's escaping, unless he
escape to the Gray,
Bo he tried to banish the phantom voices and shares which
came unbillen to his brain, and 1o recall his balance of mind by
walking calmly and sloly, nand noticing every thing which
struck his senses.
It was a warm soft evening in spring, and there were many
persons in the streets. Among others, a nurse with a little girl
in her charge, conveying her home from some children's gaiety;
n ance most likely, for the lowly lille creature was plainly
decked out in soft, snowy muslin; and her fire feet tripped
long by her nurse's side, as if to the measure of some tune she
had lately kept time to.
Suddenly up behind her there came a rough, rude errand-
boy, nine or ten years of age; in giant he looked by the fairy-
chill, as she fluttered along. I don't know how it was, but in
some awkward way he knocked the noor little girl down upon
the hard pavement as he brushed rely past, not much caring
whom he hurt, so that he got along.
The child rose sobbing with palin; and not without case,
for blood ws dropping down from the fire, but a minute before
so fair an bright - dropping down on the pretty frock, making
those scarlet marks so terrible to lile children.
The nose, n powerful woman, hd seized the boy, just as
Mr. Crons (who had seen the whole translation) came up.

The ial looked hard, and defying; bnt withal terrified at the
threat of the policeman, those ogre of on streets to all unlucky

rchins. The nurse s it, and began to draw him along, with
view making what she called '`a wholesome impression.''
His farrar increase, and with it his irritation; when the little
week face, choking away its sobs, pulled dawn nurse's head,
and aid,

to ``make neace.''
