ThE Sixteenth Century drew to a close. It was the last
day of the last year, and two hours only were wanting to
the birth of another year and of another century.
The night was solemn and beautiful. Myriads of stan
paid the deep vault of heaven; the crescent moon hung
like a silver lamp in the midst of them; a stream of rosy
and quivrering light issuing from the north traversed th
sky, like the tail of some stupendous cost; while from
its point of affluence broke forth, ever and anon, crucial-
tions rivalling in splendour and variety of hue the most
brilliant discharge of fireworks.
A sharp frost prevailed; but the atmosphere was clear
and dry, and neither wind nor snow aggravated the whole-
some rigour of the season. The water lay in thick con-
sealed masses around the conduits and wells, and the
buckets were frozen on their stands. Tho thoronghfares

were greeted with ice, and dangerous to horsemen and
vehicles; but the foodways were firm and pleasant to the
tread.
Hero and there, a fire was lighted in the streets, round
which ragged urchins and mendicants were collected, roast-
ing fragments of meat stuck upon iron prongs; or qunffing
deep draghts of metleglin and are, out of leather cups
Crowds were collected in the open places, watching the
wonders in the heavens, and drawing augurics from them,
chiefly sinister, for most of the shoulders thought the signs
shortened the speedy death of the queen, and the advent
of a new monarch from the north-a safe and easy inter-
predation, considering the advanced age and declining health
of the illustrious Elizabeth, together with the non ap-
ointment of her successor, James of sCotland.
Notwithstanding the early habits of the times, few persons
had retired to rest, an universal wish prevailing among the
citizens to see the new year in, and welcome the century nc-
companying it. Lights immersed in most windows, re-
dealing the holly-sprigs and laurel-leads stuck thickly in
their diamond panes; while, whenever as dor was opened, n
ruddy gleam burst across the street; and a glance inside
the dwelling showed its inmates either gathered round the
glowing hearth, occupied in faithful sports-fox-i'-th'-
hole, blind-nan's-buff, or shoe-the-marc-or seated at the
mile board grounding with Christmas check.
MInnie and singing were heard at every corner, and bands

with ribalds and rosemary, and filled with a drink called
``lamb's-wool,'' composed of sturdy ale, sweetened with
sugar, spiced with nutmeg, and having toasts and burt
arabs floating within it,-a draught from which seldom
brought its pretty bearers less than a great, and occasion-
ally a more valuable eoin.
Such was the vigil of the year Sixteen Hundred.
On this night, and at the tenth hour, a man of striking
and venerable appearance was scan to emerge upon a small
wooden balcony, projecting from a day-window near the top
of a picturesque structure situated at the southern ex-
treaty of London-bridge.
The old man's board and air were as white as snow-
the former descending almost to his girdle; so were th
thick oerhanging brows that shaded lis still piercing
eyes. His forehead was high, bald, and ploughed by innu-
merable wrinkles. IIis countenance, despite its dental-lika
pualeness, had a noble and majestic cost, and his figure,
though worn to the one by as life of the severest stnuy,
nd bent by the weight of years, must have been once lofty
and commanding. His dress consisted of a double and
those of sad-coloured cloth, over which he wore a loose
gown of black silk. HIs head was covered by a square
block cap, from beneath which his silver locks strayed oer
his shoulders.
Known by the name of Doctor Lamb, and addicted to
alchemicnl and philosophical pursuits, this venerable person-
age was esteemed by the vulgar as little better than a
wizard. Strange tales were reported and believed of him.

RADIo.
Amongst others, it was said that he possessed a familiar,
because he chanced to employ a deformed, were-trained
dwarf, who assisted him in his operations, and whom he
appropriately enough denominated Snapdragon.
Doctor Lamb's game was fixed iutently upon the heavens,
and he seemed to be noting the position of the moon with
reference to some particular star.
After remaining in this posture for a few minutes, he was
about to retire, when a loud crash arrested him, and he
turned to see whence it proceeded.
Immediately before him stood the Southwark Gateway-
a square stone building, with a round, embattled turret at
each corner, and a flat, leaden roof, planted with a forest
of poles, fifteen or sixteen feet high, garnished with human
heels. To his surprise, the doctor perceived that two of
these poles had just been overthrown by a tall man, who
was in the act of stripping the of their grisly burdens.
Having accomplished his object, the mysterious plunlerer
thrust his spoil into a leather bag with which he was pro-
video, tied its mouth, and was about to take his departure
by means of a rope-ladder attached to the battlements,
when his retreat was suddenly cut off by the gatekeeper,
armed with a halberd, and bearing a lantern, ho issued
from a door opening upon the leads.
The baffled marauder looked round, and remarking the
open window at which dOctor Lamb was stationed, hurled
the sack and its contents through it. II then triode to
gain the ladder, but was intercepted by the gntckceper,
who dealt him n severe blow on the head with his halberd.

DR. LAMB.
Tho plunderer uttered a loud cry, and attempted to draw
his sword; but before he could do so, he received a thrust
in the side from his opponent. Ho thon fell, and the gate-
keeper would have repeated the blow, if the doctor had not
called to him to desist.
Do not kill him, good Baldred,'' he tried.  Th
attempt may not be so criminal as it appears. Doubtless,
the mutilated remains which the poor wretch has attempted
to carry off, are those of his kindred, and horror at their
exposure must have led him to commit the offence.''
It may be, doctor,'' replied Baldred; `` and if so I shall
be sorry I have hurt him. But I am responsible for the
safe custody of these traitorous relics, and it is as much as
my own hand is worth to permit their removal.''
I know it,'' replied Doctor Lamb; ``and you are fully
justified in what you have done. It may throw some light
upon the matter, to know whose miserable remains had
been disturbed.''
 They were the heads of two rank papists,'' replied
Bualdred,  who were decapitated on over Hill, on Saint
Nicholas's day, three weeks ago, for conspiring against the
queen.''
e But their names?'' demanded the doctor.  How
were they called 7''
 They were father and son,'' replied Baldred ;-: Sir
Simon Carey and Master Reginald Carey. Perchanea

of emotion, that started his career.  They were near

I see it all,'' cried Lamb.  It was a pious and praise-
worthy deed. DUring the unfortunate youth to my dwelling,
Ealdred, and you shall be well rewarded. Use despatch, I
pray you.''
As the gatekeeper essayed to copy, the wounded man
groanel deeply, as if in great pain.

eric Doctor Lamb, in accents of commiseration, `'`and I
will anoint it with the power of sympathy. IIis anguish
ill be spcelily abated.''
eI know your worship can accomplish oilers,'' tried
aldred, throwing the halberd into the balcony. I will
do my part as gently as I can.''
And as the alchemist took up the weapon, and disappeared
through the window, the gatekeeper lifted the wounded
man by the shoulders, and conveyed him down a narrow
winding staircase to a lower chamber. Though ho pro-
ccedd carefully, the sufferer was put to excruciating pain;
nnl when Ealdred placed him in a wooden bench, and held

a lamp towards him, he perceived that his features were
darkened and distorted.
I fear it's all over with lim,'' mnrmured the gatekeeper;
eI hall has a dead body to take to Doctor Lamb. It
would be a charity to knock him on the head, rather than
let him suffer thus. The doctor passes for a cunning ma,
but if he can cure this poor youth without seeing him, by the
help of his sympathetic ointment, I shall begin to believe,
what some folks touch, that he has relations with the
level.'
While Baldred was rnminating in this manner, a sudden
and extraordinary change took place in the sufferer. As
if by magic, the contraction of the muscles subsided; the
features assumed n wholesome he, and the respiration was
no longer laborious. Ealdred stared as if a miracle had
been wrought.
Now that the countenance of the month had regained its
original expression, the gatekeeper could not help being
struck by its extreme beauty. The face was a perfect
goal, with regular and delicate features. A short silken
moustache covered the upper lip, which was short and
paul, and a pointed bear terminated the chin. The hair
was black, glossy, and cut short, so as to disclose a highly
intellectual expanse of brow.
Tho youth's figure was slight, but admirably proportioned.
His attire consisted of a black satin doublet, slashed with
white, house of black silk, and a short velvet mantle. His
eyes were still closed, and it was difficult to say what effect
they might give to the face when they lighted it up; but
AS10L.
notwithstanding its beauty, it was impossible not to admit
that a strange, sinister, and almost demoniacal expression
paraded the conntenance.
All at once, and with as much suddenness as his cure
had been effected, the young man started, uttering a
piercing try, and placed his hand to his side.
Citi1' he cried, fixing his blazing eyes on the gate-
keeper, `` why do you torture me thus? Finish me at onco

And overcome by anguish, he sank back again.

brought you here to succour you. You will be easier anon.
Doctor Lab must have wiped the halberd,'' he added to
himself.
Another sudden change. Tho pain led from the sun-
fewer's countenance, and he became easy as before.
 What has you done to me1'' he asked, with a look of
gratitude; ` to torture of my wound has suddenly ceased,
and I feel as if a balm had been dropped into it. Let me
remain in this state if you have any pity-or despatch me,
for my late agony was almost insupportable,''
 You are cared for by one who has greater skill than
any chirurgeon in London,'' replied Buldred.  If I can
manage to transport you to his lodgings, he will speelily
heal your wounds.''
e Do not delay, then,'' replied Ariel, fsintly;  fo
though I am free from pain, I feel that my life is ebbing
fast away.''
e Press this handkerchief to your side, and lean on to,''

said Buldred. Doctor Lamb's dwelling is but a step from
the gateway-in fact, the first house on the bridge. By
the way, the doctor declares he is your kinsman,''
 It is the first I ever heard of lim,' replied Auriol,
fuintly; "but take me to him quickly, or it will be too
late''
In another moment they were at the doctor's door.
Baldred tapped against it, and the summons was instantly
answered by a diminutive personage, clad in a perkin of
coarse grey serge, and having a leather apron tied round
his waist. This was Snapdragon.
Clear-eyed, smoke- begrimel, lantern-javed, the poor
dwarf seemed as if his whole life had been spent over the
furnace. And so, in fact, it had been. He had become
little better than a pair of human bellows. In his hand he
held the halberd with which Auriol had been wounded.
 So you have been playing the lech, Snapdragon, eh7''
cried Baldred.
Ay, marry lago I,'' replied the dwarf, with a wild grin,
nd displaying na wolfish set of teeth. ' My master ordered
me to smear the halberd with the sympathetic ointment. I
obeyed him; rubbed the steel point, first on one side, then
on the other; next wiped it; and then smeared it again.''
 Whereby you put the patient to exquisite pain,'' re-
plied Baldred; ` but help me to transport him to the la-
oratory.''
i know not if the doctor will care to be disturbed,'' said
Snapdragon.  Ho is busily engaged on a grand operation.''
 I will take the risk on myself,'' said Baldred. Tha

Thus urged, the dwarf laid down the halberd, and bo-
tween the to, Aunriol was speedily conveyed up a wide
taken staircase to the laboratory. Doctor Lamb was playing
the bellows at the furnace, on which a large alembic was
place, and he was so engrossel by his task, that le scarcely
noticed the entrance of the others.
 laeoe the youth on the ground, and rear his head
against the chair,'' he tried, hastily, to the dwarf. Batha
his brows with the decoction in that crucible. I will attend
to him anon. Come to me on the morrow, Allred, and I
ill repay thee for the trouble. I am busy now.''
 These relics, doctor,'' cried the gatekeeper, glancing at
the bag, which was lying on the ground, and from which a
bald head protruded-I ought to take them back with
me.''
 NEed them not-they will be safe in my keeping,''
cried Doctor Lamb, impaticntly; `` to-morrow-to-morrow.''
Casting a further glance round the laboratory, and shrug-
ging his slonllers, Baldrel departed; and SNapdragon
laing bathed the sufferer's temples with the decoction, in
obedience to his master's injunctions, turned to inquire
what he should do next.
 Donnell'' cried the doctor, so foretell that the dwarf
darted out of the room, clapping the door after him.
Doctor Lamb then applied himself to his task with re-
never armour, and in a few seconds became wholly inscn-
bible of the presence of a stranger.

Review by the stimulant, Anriol presently opened his
eyes, and gazing round the room, thought he must be
dreaming, so strange and fantastical did all appear. The
floor was covered with the implements used by the adept-
bolt-heads, crucibles, cucnrbites, and retorts, scattered about
without any attempt at arrangement. In one corner was a
large terrestrial sphere; near it was an astrolabe; and near
that a heap of disused glass vessels. On the other side, lay
s black, mysterious-looking book, fastened with brazen
clasps. Around it, were as ram's horn, a pair of forceps, a
roll of parchment, a pestle and mortar, and a large plato of
copper, green with the mysterious symbols of the Islamic
table. Near this was the leather bag containing the two
decapitated heals, one of which has burst forth. On a
table, at the farther end of the room, stood a large open
volume, with parchment leaves, covered with cabalistical
characters, referring to the names of spirits. Ncnar it were
two parchment scrolls, written in letters, respectively deno-
minted by the Charlie sages, '` the Malachi,'' and ` the
Passing of the River.'' One of these scrolls was kept in
its place by a skull. An ancient and grotesque-looking
brass lamp, with two snake-healed burners, lighted th
room. From the ceiling depended a huge scaly sea-monster,
with outspreal fins, open jaws, garnished with tremendous
teeth, and great goggling eyes. Near it hung a celestial
sphere. The chimney-piece, which was curiously cared,
and projected far into the room, mas laden with various im-
elements of Hermetic science. Above it were hung dried
bats and litter-mice, interspersed with the skills of birds

and apes. Attached to the chimney-piece was a horary,
sculptured in stone, near which hung a large star-fish. Tua
fireplace was occupied by the furnace, on which, as has been
stated, was placed an alembic, communicating by means of
a long serpentine pipe with a receiver. Within the room
were two skeletons, one of which, placed behind a curtain
in the deep erasure of the window, where its polished
bones glistened in the white moonlight, had a horrible
effect. The other enjoyed more comfortable quarters near
the chimney, its leshless feet dangling down in the smoke
arising from the furnace.
Doctor Lamb, meanwhile, steadily pursued his task,
though he ever and anon paused, to fling certain roots and
drugs upon the charcoal. As he did this, various-coloured
flames broke forth-now blue, now green, now blood-red.
Tinged by these fires, the different objects in the chamber
seemed to take other forms, and to become instinct with
animation. The gourd-shaped cucnurbites were transformed
into great bloated bonds bursting with venom; the long-
necked bolt-head became monstrous serpents; the worm-
like pipes turned into adders; the alembics looked like
plumes helmets; the characters on the Islamic table, and
those on the parchments, scene traced in fire, and to be
over changing; the sa-monster bellowed and roared, and,
flapping his fins, tried to burst irom lis look; the she-
lemons wagged their was, and raised their freshness fingers
in mockery, while blue lights burnt in their eyeless sockets;
the bellows became a prodigious bat fanning the fire with

its wings; and the old alchemist assumed the appearance of
the arch-fiend presiding over a witches' sabbath.
Auriol's brain reeled, and he pressed his hand to his
eyes, to exclude these phantasms from his sight. But
even thus they pursued him; and he imagined he could
hear the infernal riot going on around him.
Suddenly, he was roused by a loud joyful cry, and, un-
covering his eyes, he behold Doctor Lamb pouring the con-
tents of the matrass-a bright, transparent liquid-into a
small phil. Having carefully secured the bottle with a
glass stopper, the old man held it towards the light, and
gazed at it with rapture.
`At length,'' he exclaimed aloud-'` at length, the great
work is achieved. With the birth of the century now ex-
hiring I first saw light, and the draught I hold in my hand
shall enable me to see the opening of centuries and cen-
tries to coe. Composed of the lunar stones, the solar
stones, and the mercurial stones-prepared according to
the instructions of the Rabbi Ben Lucca,-namely, by the
separation of the pure from the impure, the volatilisation
of the fixed, and the fixing of the volatile; this elixir shall
renew my youth, like that of the eagle, and give me length
of days greater than any patriarch ever enjoyed.''
While this speaking, he held up the sparkling liquid,
and gazed at it like a Persian worshipping the sun.
 To live for her1'' he cried, after a pause-`` to escape
the jaws of death just when they are opening to devour
me 1-to be free from all accidents 1-'is a glorious

thought1 Ia1 I rethink me, the rabbi said there was
one peril against which the elixir could not guard me-one
vulnerable point, by which, like the heel of Achilles, death
might reach me1 What is i 1-where can it lie7''
And he relapsed into deep thought.
 THis uncertainty will poison all my happiness,'' he
continued; ` I shall lie in constant dread, as of an ini-
bible enemy. Dut no matter Perpetual lifo l-perpetual
youth 1-what more need be desired 7''
 What more, indeed 1'' cried Auriol.
Ha1'' claimed the doctor, suddenly recollecting the
wounded man, and concealing the phil beneath his gon.
e Your caution is vein, doctor,'' said Auriol.  I have
heard what you have uttered. You fancy you have disco-
verde the elixir vit.''
e Fancy I have discovered it1' tried Doctor Lamb.
 The matter is past all doubt. I am the possessor of the
wondrous secret, which the greatest philosophers of all
ages hae sought to discover--the miraculous presumptive
of the body against delay.''
 The man who brought me hither told me you were my
kinsman,'' said Auriol.  Is it so t''
 It is,'' relied the doctor, '` and you shall now learn the
conexion that subsists between us. Look at that ghastly
relic,'' he added, pointing to the head protruding from the
bag, " that was once my son sImon. His son's hand is
within the sack-your father's head-so that four geneva-
tions are brought together.''
 Gracious Heaven'' exclaimed the young man, raising

himself on his elbow.  Yon, then, are my great-grand-
sire. My father supposed you had died in his infancy. An
old tale runs in the family that you were charged with sor-
very, and fled to avoid the stake.''
e It is true that I fled, and took the name I bear at pre-
sent,'' replied the old man, ``but I need scarcely says that
the charge brought against me was false. I hae devoted
myself to abstrusest science; has held commune with the
stars; and have wrested the most hidden secrets from
Nature-but that is all. To crimes alone have stained
my soul, but both, I trust, has been expiated by re-
penance.''
 Were they deeds of loot'' asked Auriol.
One was so,'' replied Carey, with a shudder. 'It was
a cowardly and treacherous deed, aggravated by the basest
ingratitule. Listen, and you shall hear low it chuanced.
A Roman rabbi, named Ben Lucan, skilled in Hermetic
science, came to this city. His fame reached me, and I
sought him out, offering myself as his disciple. Ror
months, I remained with him in his laboratory-working
at the future, and poring over mystic lore. One night, he
showed me that volume, and, pointing to a page within it,
said:  Those characters contain the secret of connecting
the elixir of Life. I will now explain them to you, and
afterwards we will proceed to the operation.' With this,
he unfolded the master; but he made a observe, that the
menstrual was defective on one point. Wherefore, he said,
`there will ,still be peril from some hidden cause.' Oh,
with what readiness I drank in his words1 How lI gazed

at the mystic characters, as he explained their import
What visions floated before me of perpetual only and ene

-- This secret must be thine own. No one also must
possess it. 
 HIs1'' exclaimed Auriol, starting.
 The oil thought was no sooner conceived than acted
upon,'' pursued Carey. ` Instantly drawing my leonard,
I plunged it to the rabbi's cart. Dut mark that followed.
IIis blood fell upon the book, and obliterated tho chirac-
ters; nor could I by any effort of memory recall the com-
position of the elixir.''
 When did you regain the secret 2'' asked Auriol,
curiously.
 To-night,'' replied Darcy-`` within this hour. or
nigh fifty years after that fatal night I has been making
fruitless experiments. A film of blood has obscured my
mental sight. I have proceeded by calibration, solution,
putrefaction-hae produced the oils which will fix crudo
circuitry, and convert all bodies into sol and luna; but I
have over failed in fermenting the stone into the true elixir.
1-night, it came into my head to wash the blood-stained
y:c containing the secret with a subtle liquid. I did so;
ul loubting the efficacy of the experiment, left it to work,
hilo I went forth to breathe the air at my window. My
eyes were cast upwards, and I was struck with the mali-
nant aspect of my star. How to reconcile this with the
good fortune which has just befallen me, I know not-but
so it was. At this juncture, your rash, but pious attempt

occurred. Having discovered our relationship, and enjoined
the gatekeeper to bring yon hither, I returned to my old
laboratory. On glancing towards the mystic volume, what
was my surprise to see the page free from blood 1'
Auriol uttered a slight exclamation, and gazed at the
book with superstitious awe.
 THe sight was so surprising, that I dropped the sack I
had brought with me,'' pursued Carey.  Fearful of again
losing the secret, I served myself to the task, and placing
fuel on the fire, dismissed my attendant with brief injury-
tions relative to you. I then set to work. HOw I have
succeeded, you perceive. I hold in my hand the treasure
I have so long sought-so eagerly coveted. ITo whole
world'a wealth should not purchase it from me.''
Auriol gazed earnestly at his aged relative, but he said
nothing.
t In a few moments I shall be as full of rigour and a-
activity as yourself,'' continued Carey. s We shall be no
longer the great-grandsire and his descendant, but friends

lately was I enamored of her, that I tried by every art to
heighten and preserve her beauty. I fed her upon the flesh
of canons, nourished with vipers; caused her to steep her
lonely limbs in baths distilled from ross and violets; and
had recourse to the most potent cosmetics. At last I pre-

And he pressed his hand to his face.
 The mistake you then committed should serve as a
warning,'' said Auriol. ee What if it be poison yon hae

e No-no; it is the true elixir,'' replied Carey. Not a
drop must be wasted. You will witness its effect anon.

raised the potion towards his lips, a sudden pang shot
across his heart. e WHat is this 2'' he cried, staggering.

unatterable anguish on his relative.

FLashes of light passed before Anriol's eyes, and strange
noises smote his ears. For a moment he was bewildered as
with wine, and laughed and sang discordantly like a mad-
man. Every object reeled and danced around him. The
glass vessels and jars clashed their brittle sides together,
yet remained uninjured; the furnace breathed fort flames
and mephitic vapours; the spiral form of the alembic be-
cname red hot, and seemed filled with molten lend; the pipe
of the bolt-head ran blood; the sphere of the earth rolled
along the floor, and rebounded from the wall as if impelled

fixed them, with a stony glare, on the young man; while
the dead alchemist shook his hand menacingly at him.
Unable to bear these accumulated horrors, Auriol be-
came, for a short space, insensible. On recovering, all was
till. The lights within the lamp had expired; but the
bright moonlight, streaming through the window, fell upon
the rigid features of the unfortunate alchemist, and on the
cabalistic characters of the open volume beside him.
Eager to test the effect of the elixir, Auriol put his
hand to his side. All traces of the wound were gone; nor
did he experience the slightest pain in any other part of his
body. On the contrary, he seemed endowed with peter-
natural strength. His breast dilated with rapture, and he
longed to expand his joy in active motion.
Striding over the body of his aged relative, he then
open the window. As he did so, joyous peals burst from
surrounding churches, announcing the arrival of the new
year.
While listening to this clamour, Auriol gazed at the po-
pelous and picturesque city stretched out before him, and
bathed in the moonlight.

soul of the thousands within those houses will he living, save

T dID OBE T TII vAEALL-HAD.

ArE one night, in the spring of 1880, two men issued
.from a low, obsenrely-situated public-house, near Iiillbank,
and shaped their course apparently in the direction of
Vauxhall-bridge. Avoiding the footpath near the river,
they move stealthily along the farther side of the road,
where the open group offered them a easy means of flight,
in case such a course should be found expedient. So far
as it could he disccrnol by the glimpses of the moon, which
occasionally shone forth from a rank of heavy clouds, the
appearance of these personages was not much in their
four. HAggard features, stamped deeply with the cha-
craters of crime and , debauehery; fierce, restless eyes;
beards of several days' growth; wild, unkempt heads of
hair, formed their chief personal characteristics; while
sordid and ragged clothes; shoes without soles; and old
hats without crown, -.estimated the sum of their apparel,
ARIEL.
One of them was tall and gaunt, with large hands and
feet; but despite his eagerness, he evidently possessed
great strength: the other was considerably shorter, but
broad-shouldered, bow-legged, long-armed, and altogether
n most formidable ruffian. This fellow had high cheek-
bones, a long airlines nose, and a coarse mouth and chin,
in which the animal greatly predominated. He had
stubby red beard, with sandy hair, white brows and eye-
lashes. The oountenance of the other was dark and re-
passive, and covered with blotches, the result of habitual
temperance. His eyes had s leering and malignant look.
A. handkerchief spotted with blood, and tied across his
brow, contrasted strongly with his matted black hair, and
increased his natural appearance of ferocity. Tho shorter
rffian carried a mallet upon his shoulder, and his com-
anion concealed something beneath the breast of his cost,
which afterwards proved to be a dark lantern.
Not a word passed between them; but keeping a vigilant
look-out, they trudged on with quick, shambling steps. A
few sounds arose from the banks of the river, and there was
no and then a flash in the water, or a distant cry, be-
opening some passing craft; but generally all was pro-
fondly still. The quaint, Dutch-looking structures on the
opposite bank, the line of coal-barges and lighters bored
to the strand, the great timber-yards and coal-yards, the
brewhouses, gasworks, and waterworks, could only be in-
perfectly discerned; but the moonlight fell clear upon the
ancient towers of Lambeth Palace, and on the neighbouring
chr. The same glimmer aleo ran like a silver bel

across the stream, and revealed the great, stern, fortress-
lIke pile of the Penitentiary-perhaps the most dismal-
looking structure in the whole metropolis. The world of
habitations beyond this melancholy prison were buried in
darkness. The two men, however, thought nothing of these
things, and saw nothing of them; but, on arriving within
a couple of hundred yards of the bridge, suddenly, as if by
previous concert, quieted the road, and, leaping a rail, ran
across a field, and plunged into a hollow formed by a dried
pit, where they came to a momentary halt.
 You ain't a-been a-gammon' me in this matter,
Tinker 2' observed the shorter individual. ss The coe'as

 Why, you can't expect me to answer for another as I
can for myself, Sandman,'' replied the other; ' but in his
own word's to be taken for it, he's martin to be there. I
heard him say, as plainly as 'm a-speaking' to yo,- ILl

 And that was one o'clock ?'' said the Sandman.
 Thereabouts,'' replied the other.
And who did he say that to'' demanded the Sandman.
To himself, I s'pose,'' answered the Tinker;  for, as l
told yon afore, I could see no one with him.''
 Do you think he's one of our permission 7'' inquired
the Sandman.
 Bless yon 1 no-that he ain't,'' returned the Tinker.
tHe's a reg'lar slap-up spell,
 That's no reason at all,'' said the Sandman. Many
first-rate sell practises in outline. But he can't be in his

right mind to come to such a ken as that, and go on as you
mentions.''
As to that I can't say,'' replied the Tinker; `` and it
don't much matter, as far as we're concerned.''
Deil a bit,'' rejoined the Sandman, ``except-yon'rs
sure it won't a sperrit, Tinker. Ive heard say that this
crib is haunted, and though I don't fear no lion' man, a
ghost's a different sort of customer.''
 Well, you'll find our sell rail lesh and blood, you may
depend upon it,'' replied the Tinker. " So come along, and
don't let's bo frightening' ourselves with ould vimeo's tales.''
With this they emerged from the pit, crossed the lower
part of the field, and entered a narrow thoroughfare, skirted
by a few detached houses, which brought them into the
Vauxhall-bridge-road.
Here they kept on the side of the street most in shadow,
and crossed ocr whether they came to a lamp. By-and-
by, two watchmen were seen dancing from Belvoir-terrace,
and, as the guardians of the night drew near, the ruflians
crept into nn alley to let tlc pass. As soon as the coast
was clear, they ventured forth, and quickening their once,
came to a row of deserted and dilapidated houses. Tis
was their destination.
The range of situations in question, more than a dozen
in number, were, in all probability, what is clearly called
`in Chancery,'' and shared the fate of most property simi-
only circumstances. They were in a sad ruinous state-an-
roofed, without windows and floors. Tho bare walls were

condition. These neglected dwellings served as receptacles
for old iron, blocks of stone and wood, and other ponderous
matters. The aspect of the whole place was so dismal and
suspicious, that it was generally avoided by passengers after
nightfall.
Bkulking along the blank and dresry walls, the Tinker,
who was now a little in advance, stopped before a door, and
pushing it open, entered the dwelling. His companion
followed him.
The extraordinary and incongruous assemblage of objects
which met the gaze of the Sandman, coupled with the de-
served appearance of the place, produced an effect upon his
hardy but superstitious nature.
Looking round, he beheld huge mill-stones, enormous
water-wheels, boilers of steam-engines, iron vase, cylinders,
cranes, iron pumps of the strangest fashion, a gigantic pair
of wooden scales, old iron safes, old boilers, old gas-pipes,
old water-pipes, cracked old bells, old birdcsges, old plates
of iron, old pulleys, ropes, and rusty chains, huddled and
heaped together in the most fantastic disorder. In the
.
midst of the chaotic mass frowned the bearded and colossal
head of Neptune, which had one decorated the forepart of
a man-of-war. Above it, on a sort of framework, lay the
the nose of the latter being partly demolished, and the eyes
knocked in. Able these, three garden divrinities laid their
heads amicably together. On the left stood a tall Grecian
warrior, minus the head and right hand. The whole was
surmounted by an immense ventilator, stuck on the end of

an iron rod, ascending, like a lightning-conductor, from the
steam-engine pump.
Seen by the transient light of the moon, the various objects
above enumerated produced a strange effect upon the be-
holler's imagination. There was a mixture of the grotesque
and terrible about them. Nor was the building itself de-
oid of a certain influence upon his mind. Tho ragged
brickwork, overgrown with weeds, took with him the sema
balance of a human face, and seemed to keep a wary eye on
what was going forward below.
A means of crossing from one side of the building to the
other, without descending into the vault beneath, was a-
forded by a couple of planks; though as the wall on the
farther side was some feet higher than that near at hand,
and the planks were considerably bent, the passage appeared
hazardous.
Glancing round for a moment, that Tinker leaped into
the cellar, and, unmasking his lantern, showed a sort of
hiding-place, between a bulk of timber and a boiler, to
which he invited his companion.
The Sandman jumped down.

the bulk;  Is1 just take a snooze. Make me up if I store

in the side, and his companion whispered--t He's here I''

 here --- where t'' demanded the Sandman, in some]
trepidation.
 Look up, and youll soa him,'' replied the other.
Slightly altering his position, the Sandman caught sight
of a figure standing upon the planks above them. It was]
that of a young man. His hat was off, and his features, ex-
posed to the full radiance of the moon, looked deathly pale,
and though handsome, had a strange sinister expression.
He was tall, slight, and well-proportioned; and the general
cnt of his attire, the tightly-bnttoned, single-breasted coat,
together with the moustache upon his lip, gave him
military sir.
 He seems a-valkin' in his sleep,'' mattered the Sand-
man.  He's a-speaking' to some von invisible.''
 Hush-hush'' whispered the other. ' Let's hear not]
he's a-sayin',''
 Why have you brought me here1'' cried the young
man, in a voice so hollow that it thrilled his auditors.

the Sandman. e Vot d'ye think he sees 2''

-' why do you beckon me forward7 Well, I obey. I will

And he moved slowly across the plank.
 See, he's a-goin' through that door,'' cried the Tinker.
Let'a roller him.''

chattering with apprehension. We shall see summit as'll
take away our senses,''
Tut'' cried the Tinker; 'it's only a sleepy-walker.
Wot are yon agreed on 7''
With this he faulted upon the planks, and peeping
cautiously one of the open door to which they led, saw the
object of his scrutiny enter the adjoining house through a
broken window.
Making a sign to the Sandman, who was close at his
holds, the Tinker crept forward on all fours, and, on reach-
in the window, raised himself just sufficiently to command
the interior of the dwelling. Unfortunately for him, the
moon was at this moment obscured, and he could dustin-
guise nothing- except the dusky online of the various
objects with which the place was filled, and which werenearly
of the same kind as those of the neighbouring habitation.
IIe listened intently, but not the slightest sound reached
his ears.
AFter some time spent in this way, he began to fear the
young man must have departed, when all at once a piercing
scream resounded through the dwelling. Some heavy
matter was dislodged, with a thundering crash, and foot-
steps vere heard approaching the window.
HAstily retreating to their former hiding-place, th
Tinder and his companion had scarcely regained it, when
the young man again appeared on the plank. His doe-
measure had undergone a fearful change. He staggered
rather than walked, and his countenance was een pualer

along the top of the broken wall towards the door.

The other nodded, and, grasping his mallet with a deadly
and deterred purpose, sprang noiselessly upon the wall,
and overtook his intended victim just before he gained the
poor.
Clearing a sound behind him, the young ran tried, and
only just became conscious of the presence of the Sandman,
when the mallet descended upon his local, and he fell
crushed and senseless to the ground.

union, ho instantly came up with the dark lantern;

clothes of the victim, '' A reader l-I hope it's well lined.

own shoulders, and, aided by his comrade, was in the act of
hesving down the body, when the street-door suddenly
flew open, and a stout individual, attended by a couple of
watchmen, appeared at it.,
 There the villains are'' shouted the new comer.  They
have been murdering' a gentleman. Seize 'em-seize 'em:'
And, as he spoke, he discharged a pistol, the ball from
which whistled past the ears of the Tinker.
Without waiting for another salute of the same kind,
which might possibly be nearer its mark, the ruffian kicked
the lantern into the vault, and sprang after the Sandman,
who had already disappeared.
Acquainted with the intricacies of the place, the Tinker
guided his companion through a hole into an adjoining
fault, whence they scaled a wall, got into the next house,
and passing through an open window, made good their
retreat, while the watchmen were vainly searching for them
under every bulk and piece of iron.
% Here, watchmen ?'' tried to stout individual, who had
acted as leader; ``never mind the villains just now, but
help me to convey this poor young gentleman to my house,
where proper assistance can be rendered him. He still
beaches; but he has received a terrible blow on the head.
I hope his skull ain't broken.'
It is to be hoped it ain't, Mr. Thorneyeroft,'' replied
the foremost watchman; `` but them was two desperate
characters, as ever I see, and capable of any hatterosity,''
e What a frightful scream I heard to be sure'' cried
MIr. Thorneycroft. "I was certain somethin' dreadful was

more fortunate you happened to be coming' up at the time.
But we mustn't stand chatterin' here. Bring the poor
oung gentleman along.''
Preceded by Mr. Thorneycroft, the watchmen carried the
wounded man across the road towards a small house, the
door of which was held open by a female current, with a
handle in her hand. The poor oman uttered a cry of
horror as the body was brought in.
Do't be cryin' ont in that way, Peggy,'' cried Mr.
Thorneyeroft, ``but go and get me some brandy. Here,
watchmen, lay the poor young gentleman down on the sofa
-there, gently, gently. And now, one of you run to
Wheeler-street, and fetch M. Howell, the surgeon. Less
noise, Peggy-less noise, or you'll wagon Miss Ebb, and
I wouldn't have her disturbed for the world.''
With this, he snatched the bottle of brandy from the
maid, filled a wine-glass with the spirit, and poured it down
the throat of the wounded man. A stifling sound followed,
and after struggling violently for respiration for a few
seconds, the patient opened his eyes.

TE DOG-FANCIER.
TE RooxEn1 Who that has passed SAint Giles's, on
the way to the city, or coming from it, but has caught a
glimpse, through some narrow opening, of its squalid hadi-
nations, and wretched and ruffianly occupants Who but
most hare been struck with amazement, that such a huge
receptacle of ice and crime should be allowed to exist in

may be questioned. For years the evil was felt, and com-

these worse than Aegean stables. As the place is now
partially, if not altogether, swept away, and a wide and
airy street passes through the midst of its foul accesses, a
slight sketch ny be given of its former appearance.
Entering a narrow street, guarded by posts and cross-
bars, a few steps from the crowded thoroughfare brought

or over putrescent caps of rubbish and oyster-shells, all the
repulsive and hideous features of the place were displayed
before you. There was something savagely picturesque in
the aspect of the place, but its features were too loathsome
to be regarded with any other feeling than disgust. Tha
houses looked as sordid, and as thickly crusted with the
leprosy of vice, as their tenants. Horrible habitations
they were, in truth. MAny of the were without windows,
and where the frames were left, brown paper or tin supplied
the place of glass; some even wanted doors, and no effort
was made to conceal the squalor within. On the contrary,
it seemed to be intruded on observation. Miserable rooms,
almost destitute of furniture; floors and walls cured with
dirt, or decked with coarse flaring prints; shameless and
abandoned-looking women; children without shoes and
stockings, and with scarcely a rag to their backs: these
were the chief objects that met the icw. Of men, few
were visible-the majority being out on business, it is to
be presumed; but where a solitary straggler was seen,
is sinister looks and mean attire were in perfect keeping
with the spot. So thickly inhabited were these wretched
dwellings, that cry chamber, irom turret to collar,
shared with inmates. As to the cellars, they looked like
dismal caverns, which a wild best would shun. Clothes-
lines were hung from house to louse, festooned with every
kind of garment. Out of the main street branched several
alloys and passages, all displaying the same degree of
misery, or, if possible, worse, and teeming with occupants.
Personal security, however, forbade any attempt to track

these labyrinths; but imagination, after the specimen
afforded, could easily picture them. It was impossible to
move a step without insult or annoyance. Every human
being seeded brutalised and degraded; and the women
appeared utterly lost to decency, and made the street ring
with their cries, their quarrels, and their implications. It
was a positive relief to escape from this hotbed of crime
to the world without, and breathe a purer atmosphere.
Such being the aspect of the Rookery in the daytime,
what must it have been when crowded with its denizens at
night1 Yet at such an hour it will now be necessary to
enter its penetralia.
After escaping of the ruined hons in the Vauxhall-
road, the two ruffians shaped their course towards Saint
Giles's, running the greater part of the way, and reaching
the Broadway just as the church clock struck two. Darting
into a narrow alley, and needless of any obstructions they
encountered in their path, they entered a somewhat wider
cross-street, which they pursued for a short distance, and
then struck into an entry, at the bottom of which is a
swing door that admitted them into a small court, where
they found a dwarfish person wrapped in a tattered watch-
man's great-coat, seated on a stool with a horn lantern in
his hand and a putty in his mouth, the glow of which
lighted up his hard, withered features. This was the
deputy-porter of the lodging-house they were about to
enter, Addressing him by the name of Ol Parr, the
ruffians passed on, and lifting the latch of another door,

entered a sort of kitchen, at the farther end of which
blazed a cheerful fire, with as largo copper kettle boiling
upon it. On one side of the room was a deal table, round
which several men of sinister aspect and sordid attire were
collected, playing at cards. A smaller table of the same
material stood near the fire, and opposite it was a staircase
leading to the upper rooms. The place was dingy and
dirty in the extreme, the floors could not have been
scoured for years, and the walls were begrimed with filth.
In one corner, with his head resting on a heap of coals and
coke, lay a boy almost as black as a chimney-sweep, fast
asleep. He was the waiter. The principal light was
afforded by a candle stuck against the wall, with as tin
reflector behind it. Before the fire, with his back turned
towards it, stood a noticeable individual, lead in a velveteen
jacket, with ivory buttons, a striped waistcoat, drab knees,
s falod black silk neckcloth tied in a great bow, and a
pair of ancient Wellington ascending half-way up his
legs, which looked disproportionately thin when compared
with the upper part of his square, robustious, and some-
what purse frame. His face was broad, jolly, and good-
humoured, with a bottle-shaped nose, fleshy lips, and light
grey eyes, glistening with cunning and surgery. His hair,
which dangled in long flakes over his ears and neck, was of
a dunnish red, ass were also his whiskers and beard. A
superannuated white castor, with a black armband round it,
was cocked knowingly on one side of his head, and gave
him a flashy and sporting look. His particular action was

made manifest by the number of dogs he had about him.
A beautiful black-and-tan spaniel, of Charles the Second's
breed, popped its short abby nose and long silken ends one
of each coat-pocket. A png was thrust into his breast, and
he carried an exquisite Blenheim under either arm. At his
feet reposed an Isle of She terrier, and a partly-cropped
French poodle, of snow whiteness, with a red worsted
riband round his throat. This person, it need scarcely
be said, was a dog-fancier, or, in other words, a dealer in,
and a stealer of, dogs, as well as a parameter of all the tricks
connected with that nefarious trade. His self-satisfied air
made it evident he thought himself a smart clear fellow,
-and adroit and finish he was, no doubt,--while his
droll, plausible, and rather winning manners, helped him
materially to impose upon his customers. His real name
was Taylor, but he was known among his companions by
the appellation of Ginger. On the entrance of the Sandman
and the Tinker, he folded familinrly to them, and withas
sly look inquired-e Well, my 'artics-ot luk 2'
 Oh, pretty million','' replied the Sandman, grnffly.
Anl stating himself at the table, near the fire, he kicked
up the lad, who was lying fast asleep on the cold, and bad
him fetch s pot of half-and-halt. The Tinker took a place
beside him, and they waited in silence the arrival of the
liquor, which, when it came, as disposed of at a couple of
balls; while Mr. Ginger, seeing they were engaged, san-
tered towards the card-table, attended by his four-footed
companions.
'And now,'' said the Sandman, unable to control his

see what fortune' has given us.''
So saying, he unleashed the pocket-book, while the Tinker
bent over him in eager curiosity. Bnt their search for
money was fruitless. Not a single bank-note was forth-
coming. There were several memoranda and slips of paper,
a few cards, and an almanack for the year-that was all.
It was a great disappointment.
 o we've had all this trouble for nuffin', and nearly got
shot into the bargain,'' tried the Sandman, slapping down
the book on the table with an oasth. I wish Id neer un-

e Don't let's give it up in such an 'urry,'' replied the
Tinker; '` summit may be made on it yet. Let's look over
the papers.''

in the book towards him.  I'e done wi''em. Here,

While the sleepy youth stirred himself to obey these
injunctions, tho inker read over every memorandum in the
pocket-book, and then proceeded carefully to examine the
different scraps of paper with which it was filled. Not con-
tent with one perusal, he looked them all over again, and

him.  Wot kind o' secrets are they 2''

emphasis.  He seems to be a terrible chap, and to have

from his lips.  That sounds awful. But what a precious
donkey he must be to register his crimes in' that way.''
 He didn't expect the pocket-book to fall into our
hands,'' said the Tinker.

body else might see it. I repeat, he must be a fool. S'pose

That's true,'' replied the Sandman ; `'and there's no fear
of his known' as, for the ferry moment he looked round I

Well, she sent four pound, and I put up with it, pursued
Ginger; `` but about a month afterwards she loses her
favourite askin, and, strange to say, I finds it. The same game
is played oer again, and she comes down with another four
pound. But she takes care this time that I s'n't repeat
the trick; for no sooner does she obtain possession of her

the hope of keeping her dog safe there.''

the Sandman.

wi' them through them foreign steamers. There's scarcely
a steamer as leaves the port of' London but takes out a
cargo o' dogs. Ve sells 'em to the stewards, stokers, and
sailors-cheap-and no questions asked. They goes to
Ostend, Antwerp, Rotterdam, Hamburg, and sometimes to
Havre. There's a Monster Coqquilu as comes or to

precisely.
It's the law 1'' exclaimed Ginger, triumphantly. ' Now,
ve generally escapes by paying' the fine, 'cos our pals goes and
steals more dogs to raise the money. Vo always stands by

the lady sets me, an' gives me in charge to a policeman.
But that s'nifies nuffin'. I brings six witnesses to see

THE END AND THE CL0AK.
II.
A vnros barking from Mr. Ginger's dogs, shortly
after the departure of the drowsy youth, announced the
approach of a grotesque-looking little personage, whose
shoulders barely reached to a level with the top of the
table. THis was Old Parr. The dwarf's head was much
too large for his body, as is mostly the case with under-
sized persons, and was covered with a forest of rusty black
hair, protected by a strangely-shaped seal-skin eap. His
hands and feet were equally disproportionate to his frame,
and his arms were so long that he could touch his ankles
while standing upright. His spine was crooked, and his
head appeared buried in his breast. The general character
of his face seemed to pertain to the middle period of life;
but a closer inspection enabled the beholder to detect in it
marks of extreme old age. The nose was broad and flat,
like that of an ourang-outing; the resemblance to which
animal was heightened by a very long paper lip, projecting
jas, almost total absence of china, and a retreating fore-
head. The little old man's complexion was dull and
swarthy, but his eyes were keen and sparkling.
His attire was as singular as his person. Having re-
gently served as double to a famous demon-dwarf at the
Barrel Theatre, he had become possessed of a cast-off pair

of tawny tights, an elastic shirt of the same material and
complexion, to the arms of which little green bat-like wings
were attache, while a blood-red tune with vandykc points
was circle round his waist. In this strange apparel his
diminutive limbs were encased, while additional warmth
was afforded by the great-coat already mentioned, the tails
of which swept the floor after him like a train.
HAving silenced his dogs with some difficulty, MIr. Ginger
burst into a roar of laughter, excited by the little old man's
grotesque appearance, in which he was joined by the finger;
but the Sandman never relaxed a muscle of his sullen
cotntenance.
Their clarity, however, was suddenly cheeked by an
inquiry from the dwarf, in a shrill, odd tone,  Whether
they had sent for him only to laugh at him ?''
 Sartaiuly not, deputy,'' replied the Tinker. :Here,
lazy-bones, glasses o' rum-an'-later, all round,''
The drowsy month bestirrel himself to execute the com-
mand. The spirit was brought; water was procured from
the boiling copper; and the Tinker handed his guest a
smoking summer, accompanied with a polite request to
make himself comfortable.
Opposite the table at which the party were seated, it has
been said, as a staircase-old and crazy, and but imper-
fectly protected by a broken hand-rail. Midway up it stood
n door, equally dilapidated, but security by a chain and
lock, of which Old Parr, as deputy-chamberlain, kept the
key. Beyond this point, the staircase branched off on the
right, and a row of stunt wooden canisters, ranged like the

feet of so many cattle, was visible from beneath. UNtil-
mately, the staircase reached a small gallery, if such as
name can be applied to a narrow passage, communicating
with the bedrooms, the doors of which, as a matter of
needful precaution, were locked outside; and as the win-
down were grated, no one could lenovo his chamber without
the knowledge of the landlord or his representative. No
lights were allowed in the bedrooms, nor in the passgo
adjoining them.
Conciliated by the Tinker's offering, Old Parr mounted
the staircase, and planting himself near the door, took off
his great-coat, and sat down upon it. His impish garb
being thus moro fully displayed, he looked so nnearthly
and extraordinary that the dogs began to howl fearfully,

and Ginger had enough to do to quiet them.
Silence bing at length restored, to Tinker, winking
slyly at his companions, opened the conversation.
I say, deputy,'' he observed, ' ve've bin having' a bit
of' a dispute vich you can settle for ns.''
 WeIl, let's see,'' squeaked the dlnr.  What is it?"
 By, it's relative to for age,'' rejoined the Tinker.
 Wen was yo born 2''
 It's so long ago, I can't recollccet,'' returned Old Parr,
rather luckily.

4 If I were to describe the changes that he taken

the place is altered. Tho Thames itself is unlike th
Thais of old. Its waters were once as clear and bright
above London-bridge as they are now at New or Rich-
mond; and its banks, from Whitefriars to Scotland-yard,
were edged with gardens. And then the thousand gay

 True,'' replied Old Parr; '' and I, for one, am sory
for it. Remembering, as I do, what the river used to be
when enlightened by gay draft and merry company, I can't
help wishing its waters less muddy, and those ugly coal-
barges, lighters, and steamers, away. London is a mighty
city, wonderful to behold and examine, inexhaustible in its
wealth and power; but in point of beauty, it is not to be
compared with the city of Queen Bess's days. Yon should

heard so much, that my brain is quite addlel. My memory
sometimes deserts me altogether, and my past life appears
like n dream. Imagine what my feelings must be, to walk
through streets, still called by the old names, but in other
respects wholly changed. Oh1 if you could but have a
glimpse of Old London, you would not be able to endure
the modern city. The very atmosphere was different from
that which we now breathe, charged with the smoke of
myriads of sea-coal fires; and the old picturesque houses
had a claim about them, which the present habitations,
however commodious, altogether want.''

he spoke to the others.
 ITo already gien on an explanation,'' replied the
dwarf.
 Ay, but it's s cur'ons story, and I wants my friends to
hear it,'' said the Tinker, in a coaxsing tone.
 Well then, to oblige yon, All go through it again,''
rejoined the dwarf.  You must know I was for some time
servant to Doctor Lamb, an old alchemist, who lived during
the reign of good Queen Bess, and who used to pass all his
time in trying to find out the secret of changing lead and
upper into gold.''

secret, venerable,'' observed Ginger. `'And he calls em
smashes, no-a-days-not alchemists.''
Doctor Lamb's object was actually to turn base metal
into gold,'' rejoined Old Part, in a one of slight contempt.
et Bnt his chief aim was to produce the Elixir of Long Life.
Night and day he worked at the operation;-night and
day I laboured with him, until at last we were both brought
to the verge of the rare in our search after immortality.
One night-I remember it well,-it was the last night of
the sixteenth century,-a young man, severely wounded,
was brought to my master'a dwelling on London-bridge. I

helped to convey him to the laboratory, where I left him
with the doctor, who was busy with his experiments. My
curiosity being aroused, I listened at the door, and though
I could not distinguish much that passed inside, I heard
sufficient to convince me that Doctor Lamb had made the
grand discovery, and succeeded in distilling tho elixsir.
Having learnt this, I went down stairs, wondering what
would next ensue. Half an hour elapsed, and while the
bells were ringing in the new year joyfully, the young man
who I had assisted to carry up-stairs, and whom I sup-
posed at death's door, michael down as firmly as if nothing
had happened, passed by me, and disappeared, before I
could shake off my astonishment. I saw at once he had
drunk the elixir.''
Ah :-ah lI'' exclaimed to Tinker, with a knowing
glance at his companions, who returned it with gestures of
equal significance.
 As soon as he was gone,'' pursued the dwarf, I flew
to the laboratory, and there, extended on the floor, I found
the dead body of Dr. Lamb. I debated with myself what
to do-whether to pursue his murderer, for such I accounted
the young man; but, on reflection, I thought the course
useless. I next looked round to see whether the precious
olixir was gone. On the table stood s phil, from which
a strong spirituons odor exhaled; but it was empty. I
then turned my attention to a receiver, connected by a
work with an nlembic on the franco. On examining it, I
found it contained a small quantity of a bright transparent
liquid, which, poured forth into a glass, emitted precisely

the same odor as the phil. Persuaded this most by
the draught of immortality, I raised it to my lips; but
apprehension lest it might be poison stayed my hand.
Reassured, however, by the thought of the young man's
miraculous recovery, I stuffed the potion. It was as if I
had swallowed fire, and at first I thought all was over with
me. I shielded out; but there was no one to heed my
cries, unless it were my dead master, and two or three
skeletons with which the walls zero garnished. And these,
in truth, did seem to hear me; for the dead corpse opened
its glassy orbs, and eyed me reproachfully; the skeletons
shook their fleslless arms and hibberd; and the various
strange objects with which the chamber was filled, seemed
to deride and menace me. The terror occasioned by these
fantasies, combined with the potency of the draught, took
away my senses. When I recovered, I found all tranquil.
Doctor Lamb was lying stark and stiff at my feet, with an
expression of reproach on his fixed conntenance; and the
skeletons were hanging quietly in their places. Convinced
that I was proof against death, I went forth. But a curse

e No; it has quite escaped my memory,'' answered Old

say.''
e Was it Auriol Darcy 2'' demanded the other.
4 That was the name,'' tried Old Parr, starting up in
extreme surprise. I heard Doctor Lamb call him so.
But how, in the name of wonder, do you come to know it2"
e Ve'e got summit, at last,'' said the Tinker, with a
self-applauding glance at his friends.
 How do you come to know it, I say 7'' repeated the
dwarf, in extreme agitation.

look; `` you see I does know some cur'ous matters as well
as you, my old file. You'll be good evidence, in case ve

dubiously.  There's no hurry.''
e No; e must decile at once,'' said the Tinker.  Just
examine them papers,'' he added, handing the pocket-book
to OId Parr, `` and four us with your opinion on 'em.''.
The dwarf was about to unleash the book committed to
his charge, when a hand was suddenly thrust through the
canisters of the upper part of the staircase, which, as has
been already stated, was divided from the lower by the
door. A piece of heavy black drspery next descended like
a cloud, concealing all behind it except the hand, with
which the dwarf was suddenly seized by the name of the
neck, lifted up in the air, and, notwithstanding his shrieks
and struggles, carried clean off.
. Great confusion attended his disappearance. The dogs
set up a prodigious barking, and flew to the rescue-one
of the largest of the passing over the body of the drowsy
waiter, who had sought his customary couch upon the goals,
and rousing him from his slumbers; while the Tinker,
uttering a fierce imprcecation, upset his chair in his haste
to catch hold of the dwarf's legs; but the latter was already
out of reach, and the next moment had vanished entirely,

with his back to the fire, had witnessed the occurrence
in open-mouthed astonishment. : Vy, curse it1 if the
venerable ain't a-taken the pocket-book with him1 It's
my opinion the devil has flown day with the old feller.
His time was nearer at 'and than he expected.''

the pocket-book 1' cried the Tinker. And, dashing up the
stairs, he caught hold of the railing above, and swinging
himself up by a powerful effort, passed through an opening,
occasioned by the removal of one of the bnnistcrs.
Groping along the gallery, which was buried in profound
darkness, he shouted to the dwarf, but received no answer
to his vociferations; neither could he discover any one.
though he felt on either side of the passage with out-
stretched hands. The occupants of the different chambers,
alarmed by the noise, called out to know what was going
forward; but being locked in their rooms, they could render
no assistance.
While the Tinker was thus pursuing his search in the
dark, venting his rage and disappointment in the most
dreadful implications, the staircase door was opened by the
landlord, who had found the key in the great-coat left be-
hind by the dwarf. With the landlord came the Sandman
and Ginger, the latter of whom was attended by all his
dogs, still barking furiously; while the rear of the party
was brought up by the drowsy waiter, now will awake with
fright, and carrying a handle.
But though every nook and corner of the place was
visited-though the attics were searched, `and all the win-
down examined-not a trace of the dwarf could bc disco-
verde, nor any clue to his mysterious disappearance detected.
Astonishment and alarm sat on every countenance.

 It's certain that no one has entered the house wearing a
cloak such as you describe; nor could any of the lodgers,
to my knowledge, get out of their rooms. It was Old
Parr's business, as you know, to lock 'em up carefully for
the night.''
 Well, all's over with him now,'' said the Tinker; ``and

TIE IRON-IRELAND's DAUGHTER. G3
I.
TE NoN-MEcCA's DAUGHTeR.
A wAR had elapsed since Auriol Carey was conveyed to
the iron-merchant's dwelling, after the attack male upon
him by the ruffians in the ruined house; and though
almost recovered from the serious injuries he had decided,
he still remained the guest of his pressure.
It was a bright spring morning, when a door lending to
to yard in front of the house opened, and a young girl,
bright and fresh as the morning's self, issued from it.
A lonelier creature than Eba Thorneycroft cannot be
imagined. TIer figure was perfection-slight, tall, and
raishingly proportioned, with a slender waist, little limbs,
and fairy feet that would have made the fortune of an
opera-dancer. Her features were almost angclic in ex-
pression, with an outline of the utmost delicacy and pre-
vision-not cold, classical regularity-but that softer and
incomparably more lovely mould peculiar to our own crime.
Ebb's countenance was a type of Saxon beauty. Hor
complexion was pure white, tinged with a slight bloom.
TIer eyes were of a serene summer blue, arched oer by
brows somo shades darker than the radiant tresses that
fell on either cheek, and were parted oer a brow smoother
than alabaster. Her attire was simple, but tasteful, and

by its dark colour threw into relief the exceeding fairness
of her skin.
Abba's first car was to feed her favourite linnet, placed
in a csto over the door. Having next patted the head of a
huge bulldog who came out of his kennel to greet her. and
exchanged a few words with two men employed at a force
in the inner part of the building on the right, she advanced
farther into the yard.
This part of the premises, being strewn wit ironwork of
every possible shape, presented a very singular appearance,
and may merit some description. There were heaps of
rusty iron chains flag together like fishermen's nets, old
iron area-guards, iron kitchen-fenders, old grates, safes,
piles of old iron bowls, a large assortment of old iron pans
and dishes, a ditto of old ovens, kettles without number,
sledge-hammers, nails, braziers, chimney-bowls, and smoke-
jacks.
Stout upright posts, supporting cross-beams on the top,
were placed at intervals on either side of the yard, and
these were decorated, in the most artistic style, with rat-
traps, man-tips, iron lanterns, pulleys, padlocks, chains,
rivets, triangles, iron rods, disused street lampe, dis-
mounted cannon and anchors. Attached to hooks in the
cross-beam nearest the house hung a row of old horse-
shoes, while from the centre depended a largo rusty bell.
Near the dog's kennel was a tool-box, likewise garnished
with horse-shoes, and containing pincers, films, hammers,
and other implements proper to the smith. beyond this

was an open doorway leading to the workshop, where the
two men before mentioned were busy at the forge.
Though it was still early, the road was stir with pas-
singers, and many wagons and carts, laden with hay,
straw, and vegetables, were passing. Abba, however, had
been solely drawn forth by the beauty of the morning, and
she stopped for a moment at the street gate, to breathe
the balmy air. As she inhaled the gentle breeze, and felt
the warm sunshine upon her cheek, her thoughts wandered
away into the green meadows in which she had strayed as
a child, and she longed to ramble amid them again. Per-
has she scarcely desired a solitary stroll; but however this
might be, she was too much engrossed by the eerie to
notice a tall man, wrapped in a long black clone, who re-
garden her with the most fixed attention, as he passed on
the opposite side of the road.
Proceeding to a short distance, this personage crossed
over, and returned slowly towards the iron-merchant's
selling. Abba then, for the first time, remarked him,
and was started by his strange, sinister appearance. His
features were handsome, but so malignant and force in ex-
pression, that they inspired only aversion. A sardonic grin
curled his thin lips, and his short, crisply-curled hair, ran
black in hue, contrasted forcibly and disagreeably with his
caluaverous complexion. An attraction like that of the
snake seemed to reside in his dark blazing eyes, for Elba
trembled like a bird beneath their influence, and could not
remove her gaze from them. A vague presentiment of

being before her might be connected in some inexplicable
On his part, the stranger was not insensible to the im-
pression he had produced, and suddenly halting, he kept
his eyes riveted on tloso of the girl, who, after remaining
spell-bond, as it were, for a few moments, precipitately re-
treated towards the house.
just as she reached the door, and was about to pass
through it, Auriol came forth. He was pale, as if from
recent suffering, and bore his left arm in a sling.
 Yon look agitated,'' ho said, noticing Abba's easier-
ness. What has happened '
 Not much,'' she replied, a deep blush meaning hcr
cheeks. `` But I have been somewhat alarmed by the person
near the gate,''
 Indeed?'' cried Auriol, darting forward. 4Where is
he? I see no one.''

joined Abba, following him cautiously.

 Then you know the person I allude to 1'' she rejoined.
e I know some one answering his description,'' he re-
plied, with a forced smile.
4 Once beheld, the man I mean is not to be forgotten,''
said Abba. IIe has a countenance such as I never saw
before. If I could believe in the ` evil eye,' I should be
sure he possessed it.''
s Is he, there can be no doubt,'' rejoined Auriol, in a
sombre tone.

 who and what is he, then 2'' demanded Abba.
 He is a messenger of ill,'' replied Auriol, ` and I am
thankful he is gone.''
 Are yon quite sure of it71'' he asked, glancing timor-
only up and down the road. But the mysterious indi-
visual could no longer be seen.
` And so, after exiting my curiosity in this manner, you
will not satisfy it2' she said.
e I cannot,'' rejoined Anriol, somewhat sternly.
t Nay, then, since you are so ungracious, I shall go and
prepare breakfast,'' she replied.  My father must be
down by this time.''
 Stay:'' cried Auriol, arresting her, as she was about
to pass through the door.  I wish to have a word with
you.''
Abba stopped, and the bloom suddenly forsook ler
cheeks.
But Auriol seemed unable to proceed. Neither dared to
regard the other; and a profound silence profile between
them for a few moments.
 Abba,'' said Anriol at length, 'I am about to leave
your father's house to-day.''
 hy so soon 7'' slo exclaimed, looking up into his
face.  You are not entirely recovered yet.''
I dare not stay longer,'' he said.
 Dare not '' tried Abba. And she again cast down her
eyes; but Auriol made no reply.
Fortunately the silence was broken by the clinking of the
smiths' hammers upon the anvil.

 If you must rally go,'' said Abba, looking up, after
long pause, `` I hope we shall see you again7''
 MOst assuredly,'' replied Auriol.  I owe your worthy
father a deep debt of gratitude-a debt which, I fear, I
shall never be able to repay.''
 My father is more than repaid in saving your life,'' she
replied. ``I am sure he will be sorry to learn you are going
so soon.''
4 I have been here a week,'' said Auriol.  If I remained
longer, I might not be able to go at all,''
There was another pause, during which a stout old
fellow in the workshop quieted the anvil for a moment,
and, catching a glimpse of the young couple, muttered to
his helpmate:
 I say, Ned, To a-thinking' our master'll soon have
a son-in-law. There's pretty plain signs on it at yonder
door,''
 So there be, John,'' replied Ned, peeping round. :He's
a good-looking' young follow that. I wish to could hear
their discourse.''
e No, that ain't fair,'' replied John, raking some small
coal upon the fire, and working away at the bellows.
4 I would not for the world as a disagreeable question,''
said Abba, again raising her eyes, ``but since you are about
to quit us, I must confess I should like to know something
of your history.''

AUDIO.
 Forgive me if I decline to comply with your desire,''
replied Auriol.  You would not believe me, were I to re-
late my history. But this I may say, that it is stranger

and wilder than any you ever heard. The prisoner in his
cell is not restrained by more terrible fetters than those
which bind me to silence.'
Abba gazed at him as if she feared his reasoning were
wandering.
 You think me mad,'' ssid Anriol; ` would I were so
But I shall never lose the clear perception of my woes.
Hear me, Abba Fate has brought me into this house. I
have seen you, and experienced your gentle ministry; and
it is impossible, so circumstances, to be blind to yom
attractions. I have only been too sensible to them-but I
will not well on that theme, nor run the risk of exciting a
passion which must destroy you. I will ask you to hate
me-to regard me as a monster whom you ought to shun
rather than as a being for whom you should entertain the
slightest sympathy.''
 You have some motive in saying this to me,'' tried the
terrified girl.
 My movie is to warn yon,'' said Aerial. t If yon
loe me, you are lost-utterly lost''

She was so startled, that she could make no reply, but
burst into tears. Anriol took her hand, which sho un-
resisting yielded.
 A terrible fatality attaches to me, in which you must
have to share,'' he said, in a solemn tone.
 Would you had never come to my father's house t''
he exclaimed, in a voice of anguish.
 Is it, then, too late'' cried Anriol, despairingly.
4 It is-if to love you be fatal,'' sho rejoined.

AURIOL.
e aI' exclaimed Auriol, striking his forehead with his
clenched hand.  Real your words-Abba-recall them
-but no, once uttered-it is impossible. You are bound
to me for eer. I must fulfil my destiny.''
At this juncture a low growl broke from the dog, and,
guided by the sound, the youthful couple beheld, standing
near the gate, the tall dark man in the black cloak. A
fiendish side sat upon his countenance.
e That is the man who frightened mel'' cried Abba.
 It is the person I supposed1' ejaculated Auriol. I
must speak to him. Leave me, Abba. I will join you
presently.''
And as the girl, half sinking with apprehension, with-
drew, he advanced quickly towards the intruder.
4 I had sought you for some days,'' said the tall man,
in a stern, commanding once.  You have not kept your
appointment with me.''
 I could not,'' replied Auriol-'' nn accident hss be-
fallen me.''
4I know it,'' rejoined the other. t I am are you
were assailed by ruffians in the tuned house over the way.
But you are recovered now, and can go forth. You ought
to have communicated with me.''
 It was my intention to do so,'' said Anriol.
 Our meeting cannot be delayed much longer,'' pursued
the stranger. e I will give you three more days. On the
evening of the last day, at the hour of seven, I shall look
for you at the foot of the state in Hyde Park.''
ee I will be there,' replied Auriol.
TRE MEETING NEAR THE STATUE. 71
 That girl must be the next victim,'' said the stranger,
with s grim smile.
 Peace 1'' thundered Anriol.
t Any, I need not remind you of the tenure by which
you maintain your power,'' rejoined the stranger.  But I
will not trouble you further now.''
And, wrapping his cloak more closely round him, he is-
appeared.
4 Fate has one more involved me in its net'' cried
Anriol, bitterly. e But I will sae Ebbs, whatever it may
cost me. I will see her no more,''
And instead of returning to the house, he hurried away
in the opposite direction of the stranger.
IT evening of the third day arrived, and Auriol entered
Hyde Park by Stanhope-gate. Glancing at his watch, and
finding it wanted nearly three-quarters of an hour of the
time appointed for his meeting with the mysterious stranger,
he struck across the Park, in the direction of the Serpentine
Rier. Apparently he was now perfectly recovered, for
his arm was without the support of the sling, and he
walked with great swiftness. But his countenance was
deathly pale, and his looks were so wild and disordered, that
the few persons he encountered shrank from him aghast
zz
AOL.
A few minutes' rapid walking brought him to the
eastern extremity of the Serpentine, and dancing close
to the edge of the embankment, he gazed at the waters
beneath his feet.
I would plange into them, if I could find repose,'' e
murmured.  But it would avail nothing. I should only
add to my sufferings. No; I must continue to endure the
weight of a life burdened by crime and remorse, till I can
find out the means of freeing myself from it. Once I
dreaded this unknown danger, but now I seok for it in
vain.''
The current of his thoughts were here interrupted by the
sudden appearance of a dark object on the surface of the
water, which he at first took to be a huge fish, with a pair
of green fins springing from its back; but after watching
it more closely for a few moments, he became convinced
that it was a human being, tricked out in some masquerade
attire, while the slight struggles which it male proved that
life was not entirely extinct.
Though, the moment before, he had contemplated self-
destruction, and had only been restrained from the attempt
by the certainty of failing in his purpose, instinct prompted
him to rescue the perishing creature before him. Without
hesitation, therefore, and without carrying to diest himself
of his clothes, he dashed into the water, and striking out,
instantly reached the object of his quest, which still con-
tinted to float, and turning it over, for the face was down-
wards, he perceived it was an old man, of exceedingly small
size, painted in a pantomime garb. II also remarked



LL
TE MEETING NEAR THE sTATE. 73
that a rope was twisted round the neck of the unfortunate
being, making it evident that some violent attempt had
been made upon his life.
WIthout pausing for further investigation, he took firm
hold of the leather wings of the dwarf, and with his risen-
aged hand propelled himself towards the shore, dragging
the other after him. The next instant he reached the bank,
clambered up the lo brickwork, and placed his burden in
safety.
The noise of the plunge had attracted attention, and
several persons now hurried to the spot. On coming up,
and finding Auriol bending over a water-sprite--for such,
at first sight, the dwarf appeared-they could not repress
their astonishment. Wholly insensible to the presence of

those around him, Auriol endeavored to real where he
lashed upon him, and he cried aloud,  Why, it is my poor
murdered grandfather's attendant, Flapdragonl But no

singularly striking'
Auriol's exelamations, coupled with his wild lemeanour,
surprised the bystanders, and they came to the conclusion
that he must be a travelling showman, who had attempted
to drown his dwarf-the grotesque, impish garb of the
latter convincing thom that he had been exhibited at a
booth. They made signs, therefore, to each other not to
let Auriol escape, and one of them, raising the dwarf's
head on his knee, produced a flask, and poured aeome brandy
from it down his throat, while others chafed his hands

These efforts were attended with much speedier success
than might have been anticipated. After a struggle or two
for respiration the dwarf opened his eyes, and gazed at the
group around him.
It must be Snapdragon I'' exclaimed Anriol.
Ah 1 who calls me?'' cried the dwarf.
I1' rejoined Auriol.  Do you not recollect me2''

eddy; ``you are -'' and he stopped.

dwarf's throat.
I have,'' replied the little old man.

]another, laying hold of Auriol.
By him-no,'' said the dwarf; I have not seen that
gentleman for nearly three centuries.''
 Three centuries, my little patriarch 7'' said the man
who had given him the brandy.  That's a long time.
Think again.''
:It's perfectly true, nevertheless,'' replied the dwarf.
e His wits have been washed away by the water,'' said
the first speaker.  Give him a drop more brandy.''
 Not a bit of it,'' rejoined the dwarf; `' my senses were
never clearer than at this moment. At last we have met,'
he continued, addressing Auriol, ``and I hope we shall not
]speedily part again. We hold life by the same time.''
 How came you in the desperate condition in which I
found you 1'' demanded Auriol, easively.

Again the bystanders exchanged significant looks.

in a long black cloak.''

Some nights ago, I should fancy,'' replied the dwarf,
for ITv been a terrible long time under water. I have
only just managed to shake off the stone''
At this speech there was a twitter of incredulity among
the bystanders.
Yon may laugh, but it's true' tried the dwarf,
angrily.

money in the hands of the man who held the dwarf in his
 writing, sir,'' replied the man. oIl take him to
the Life Guardsman, near the barracks, that'a the nearest

To join him there in an hour,'' replied Auriol, moving
away.
And as he disappeared, the man took up his little burden,
and bent his steps towards the barracks.
Utterly disregarding the dripping state of his habilis-
ments, Auriol proceeded quickly to the place of rendezvous.

Arrived there, he looked around, and not seeing any one
flung himself upon a bench at the foot of the gentle emi-
fence on which the gigantic statue of Achilles is placed.
It was becoming rapidly dark, and heavy clouds, ported-
ing speedy rain, increased the gloom. Auriol's thoughts
were sombre as the weather and the hour, and he fell into
deep fit of abstraction, from which he was roused by hand
laid on his shoulder.
Recoiling at the touch, he raised his eyes, and beheld the
stranger leaning over him, and gazing at him with a look
of diabolical exaltation. The cloak was thrown partly
aside, so as to display the tall, gaunt figure of its wearer;
while the large collar of subtle fur with which it was deco-
rated stood out like the wings of a demon. The stranger's
hat was off, and his high broad forehead, white as marble,
was fully repealed.
Our meeting must be brief,'' he said. aRe you pre-
panel to ful6l the compact7

fixing a withering glance upon him.  Bring her to me

And, eneloping himself in his cloak, he retreated behind
the state, and was lost to view.
As he disappeared, a moaning wind arose, and heavy
rain descended. Still Auriol did not quit the bench.

It was about two o'clock, on a charming spring day, that
a stout middle-aged man, accompanied by a young person
of extraordinary beauty, took up his station in front of
Langham Church. Just as the clock struck the hour,
a young man issued at a quick pace from a cross-street,
and came upon the couple before he was aware of it. Ha
was evidently greatly embarrassed, and would have beaten
a retreat, but that was impossible. His embarrassment
was in some degree shared by the young lady; sha brushed
deeply, but could not conceal her satisfaction at the en-
counter. The elder individual, who did not appear to
notice the confusion of either party, immediately extended
his hand to the young man, and exclaimed:

dark, but the light of the fire revealed his malignant
countcnance. I don't exaggerate, when I say his eyes
gleamed like those of a tiger. I was terribly frightened,
but something prevented me from crying out. After gazing
nt me for a few moments, with a look that seemed to fasti-
nate while it frightened me, he said-t You desire to see]
Anriol Carey. I have just quieted him. Go to Langham-
place to-morrow, and, as the clock strikes two, you will
behold him.' Without waiting for any reply on my part,
he disappeared.''
Ah, you never told me this, you little rogne l'' cried
MIr. Thorneycroft.  You persuaded me to come out with]
you, in the hope of meeting Mr. Carey; but you did not
say you were sure to find him. So you sent this myste-
lions gentleman to her he 7'' he added to Auriol.
 No, I did not,'' replied the other, gloomily.
 Indeed 1'' exclaimed the iron-merchant, with a puzzled
look.
 Oh, then I suppose he thought it might relief her
anxiety. However, since wo hare met, I hope you'll walk]
home and dine with us.''
Auriol was about to decline the invitation, but Abba]
glanced at him entreatingly.
eI have an engagement, but I will forego it,'' he said,
offering his arm to her.
And they walked along towards Oxford-street, while]
Mr. Thorneyeroft followed, a few paces behind them.
 This is very kind of you, Mr. Day,'' said Abba.

I grieve to hear it,'' he rejoined. I hope you had
forgotten me.''
 I am sure you did not think so,'' she cried.
As she spoke, she felt a shudder pass through Anriol's
frame.
 What ails you'' she anxiously inquired.
 I would have shunned you, if I could, Abbas,'' he re-
plied; `` but a fate, against which it is in to contend, has
brought us together again.''
I am glad of it,'' she replied; '` because, ever since our
Iast interview, I have been reflecting on what you then said
to me, and am persuaded you are labouring under some
strange delusion, occasioned by your recent accident.''
 Be not deceived, Abba,'' cried Auriol.  I am under
terrible influence. I need not remind you of the mysterious
individual who tapped at your window last night.''
 What of him?'' demanded Abba, with a thrill of ap-
prehension.
 He it is who controls my destiny,'' replied Auriol.
 But what has he to do with me1'' asked Abba.
 Much, much,'' he replied, with a perceptible shudder.
 You terrify me, Auriol,'' sle rejoined.  TEll me what
you mean-in pity, tell me''
Befro Auriol could reply, Mr. Thorneyeroft stepped for-
word, and turned the conversation into another channel.
Soon after this, they reached the Quadrant, and were
passing beneath the eastern colonnade, when Abba's attend-
tion was attracted towards a man who was leading a couple
of dogs by a string, while he had others under his arm,

Charles the Second spaniel.
Allow me to present on with it'' said Auriol.
e You know I should value it, as coming from you,'' she
replied, blushing deeply; ` but I cannot accept it; so I
will not look at it again, for fear I should be tempted.''
The dog-fancier, however, noticing Abba's admiration,
held forward the spaniel, and said,  Do just look at the
pretty little created, miss. It can't its equal for beauty.
Don't be agreed on it, miss. It's as gentle as a lab.''
e Oh l you little darling I'' Abba said, patting its sleek
head and long silken ears, while it fixed its large black
eyes upon her, as if treating her to become its purchaser.
 Fairy seems to have taken quite a fancy to you, miss,''
observed Ginger; `` and she ain't i' the habit o' fallin' i

claimed Bba, in an ecstasy of delight.

have their hair cut, or their wigs dressed by im. A

Trigger. Not only will he treat you well, but he will regale
you with all the gossip of the court; he will give you the
last funny thing of Mr. Serjeant Larkins; he will tell you
how many briefs the great Mr. Skinner Fine receives-what
the VIce-Chancellor is doing; and you will own, on rising,
that you have never spent a five minutes more agreeably.
BEsides, you are likely to see some noticeable characters,
for Mr. Trigger's shop is quite as lounge. Perhaps you may
find a young barrister who has just been '' called,'' ordering
his `first win,'' and you may hear the prognostications of
Mr. Trigger as to his future distinction. Ah, sir,'' he
will say, glancing at the stolid features of the young and,
``you have quite the face of the Chief Justice-quite to

win-that was a little before my time; but I hope to live
to see you chief, sir. Quite within your reach, if you choose
to apply. Sure of it, sir-quito sure,'' Or you may see
him attending to some grave master in Chncery, and
listening with profound attention to his remarks; or scream-
in with laughter at the jokes of some smart special leader;
or talking of the theatres, the actors and actresses, to some
young attorneys, or pupils in conveyancers' chambers; for
those are the sort of customers in whom Mr. Trigger chilly
delights; with them, indeed, he is great, for it is by them
he has been dubbed the Barber of London. His shop is
also frequented by managing clerks, barristers' clerks, en-
grossing clerks, and others; but these are, for the most part,
his private friends.

into the room, On the block is a judge's wig, which MIr.
Trigger has just been dressing, and a little farther, on a
higher block, is that of a counsel. On either side of the
fireplace are portraits of Lord Eldon and For Lyndhurst.
some other portraits of pretty actresses are likewise to be
seen. Against the counter rests n board, displaying the
playbill of the opening; and near it is a large piece of
emblematic crockery, indicating that bears'-grease may
be had on the premises. Amongst Mr. Trigger's lie stock
may b enumerated his favourite magpie, placed in wicker
cage in the window, which chapters incessantly, and knows
everything, its master launches, ` as well as a Christian.''

ACtION.
And now as to Mr. Tuffnell TRigger himself. He is very
tall and very thin, and holds himself so upright that he
loses not an inch of his stature. His head is large and is
face long, with marked, if not very striking features, charged,
it must be admitted, with a very self-satisfied expression.
One cannot carn the appellation of the Barber of Toulon
without talent; and it is the consciousness of this talent
that lends to MIr. Trigger's features their apparently con-
cited expression. A fringe of black whisker adorns is
cheek and china, and his black bristly hair is brushed baek,
so as to exhibit the prodigious expanse of his forehead.
IIis eyebrows are elevated, as if in constant scorn.
The attire in which Mr. ridge is ordinarily seen, consists
of a black velvet waistcoat, and tight black continuations.
These are protected by a white apron tied round his waist,
with pockets to hold his scissors and combs; over all, he
wears a short keen jacket, into the pockets of which his
hands are constantly thrust when not otherwise employed,
A black satin stoke with a large bow encireles his throat,
nnl Iis shirt is fastened by black enamel studs. Such is
MI, Tunll Trigger, accept the Barber of London.
At the time of his introduction to the reader, MIr. Trigger
had just advertised for an assistant, his present young man,
Rutherford Watts, being about to leave him, and set up for
himself in Canterbury. It was about to o'clock, and Mr,
Trigger had just withdrawn into an inner room to take some
rejection, when, on returning, he found Watts occupied in
cutting the hair of a miller-aged, sour-looking gentleman,
ho was stated fore tho fire. MIr. Trigger bored to the

conversation with him, at no notice being taken of his
advances, he went and talked to his magpie.
WThilo hoe was chattering to it, the ingenious bird
streamed forth : : Pretty lear 1-pretty dear '
Oh I whats that Who is it?' tried 'ridge.
 Pretty car.-pretty lea' reiterated the magic.
Upon this, Triage looked around, and saw a very
singular little man enter the shop. He had somewhat the
appearance of a groom, being clothed in a long grey cont,
drab knees, and small top-boots. IIe had a large and
remarkably projecting month, like that of a baboon, and a
great shock end of black hair.

I see nothing pretty about him,'' thought MIr. Trigger.

Chancellor himself to say what his age might be,''
The little man task off his hat, and making n profound
how to the barber, unfolded tho 7times newspaper, which he
carried ruler his arm, and held it up to Bridge.

berber.
HIgh wages :-high wages I'' screamed tho magic.

an advertisement in the newspaper.
 Yes, yes, that's my alcrtisement, friend,'' replied MIr.
Trigger.  But what of ite

occurred. While eyeing the new comer, Watts neglected to

he burnt the song-looking gentleman's forehead, and

minute.''
 Will, my little friend,'' observed Trigger, '`and what
may be your object in coming to me, as the great con-
veyancer, Mr. Powell, observes to his clients-what may
be your object 7'
 You want an assistant, don't you, sir 1'' rejoined the
little man, hubly.
:Do you apply on your own account, or on behalf of a
friend 7' asked TRigger.
On my own,'' replied the little man.
 What are your qualifications 1' demanded Trigger-
what are your qualifications 2''
I fancy I understand something of the business,''
replied the little man. I was a perruquier myself, when
wigs were more in fashion than they are now.''

have been in the last century-in Queen Anne's time-he 2''
s You have hit it exactly, sir,'' replied the little man.
 It was in Queen Anne's time.''
 Perhaps you recollect when wigs were first worn, my
little Nestor,'' cried Mr. TRigger.
Perfectly,'' replied the little man.  French periwig
were first worn in Charles the Second's time.''
4You saw 'em, of course?'' tried the barber, with a sneer.

 Oh, he must be out of his mind,'' erie Trigger. 4 Ia

Master of the Rolls would observe.''
I hope I may suit you, sir,'' said the little man.
I don't think you will, my friend,' replied Mr. Trigger;
i don't think you will. You don't seem to have a hand for
hairdressing. Are you aware of the talent the art
requires? Are you aware what it has cost me to earn the
enviable title of the Barber of London? 'm as proud of
that title as if I were-''

 Precisely, Mag,'' sai MIr. Bridge; `` as if I were Lord
Chancellor.''
 Well, 'm sorry for it,'' said the little man, dis-

dressing the little man, who still lingered in the shop.
4 Why, sir, Ive had many names in my time,'' he replied.
`At one time I was called Snapdragon-at another, Old
Parr-but my real name, I believe, is Morse-Gregory

An Old Bailey answer,'' cried MIr. Trigger, shaking his
head. Snapdragon, alias Old Parr-alias Gregory Morse

Pretty dear 1'' screamed MIng.
``And you want a place l'' demanded the sour-looking
gentleman, eyeing him narrowly.
Sadly,'' replied Morse.
Well, then, follow me,'' said the gentleman, ''and All

And they left the shop together.

TR MOO I TR FIRST QUARTER.
In spite of his resolution to the contrary, Auriol found
it impossible to resist the fascination of Ebb's society, and
became a daily visitor at her father's house. Mr. Thorney-
croft noticed the growing attachment between them with
satisfaction. His great wish was to see his daughter united
to the husband of her choice, and in the hope of smoothing
the way, to let Auriol understand that we should give her
a considerable marriage-portion.
For the last few days a wonderful alteration had taken
place in Auriol's manner, and he seemed to have shaken off
altogether the cloud that had hitherto sat upon his spirits.
Enchanted by the change, Ebbs indulged in the most bliss-
ful anticipations of the future.
One evening they walked forth together, and almost
consciously directed their steps towards the river. Lin-
bering on its banks, they gazed on the full tide, admired
the glorious sunset, and breathed over and over again those
tender nothings so eloquent in lovers' ears.
 Oh1 how different you are from what you were a week
ago,'' said Abba, playful. Promise me not to indulge
in any more of those gloomy fancies.''
Will not indulge in them if I can help it, rest assured

sweet Abba,'' he replied.  But my spirits are not always
nder my control. I am surprised at my own cheerfulness
this evening.''
I never felt so happy,'' she replied; ``and the whole
scene is in unison with my feeling. How soothing is the
calm river flowing at one feel-how tender is the warm
sky, still flushed with red, though the sun has set I-And
sec, onder hangs the crescent moon. He is in her first
quarter.''
 The moon in her first quarter t'' cried Auriol, in a one
of anguish. All then is oer.''
 What means this sudden change ?' cried Abba, fright-
ened by his looks.
 Oh, Abba,'' he replied, ``I must lace you. I have
allowed myself to dream of happiness too long. I am an
-:::
accursed being, doomed only to bring misery pon those
not believe me. Let me go, and perhaps it may not yet be
too late to save you.''
e Oh no, do not leave me l'' cried Abba. :I have no
fear while you are with me.''
ee But you do not know the terrible fate I am linked to,'
he said.  This is the night when it will be accomplished.''
 Your moody fancies do not alarm me as they used to
do, dear Auriol,'' she rejoined, '` because i know them to be
the fruit of a diseased imagination. Come, let us continuo
our walk,'' she added, taking his arm kindly.
Abba,'' he cried, ` I implore you to let me go I had
not the power to tear myself away unless you and me.''

 'm glad to hear it,'' she rejoined, '`' for then I hall
hold you fast''
You know not what you do'' cried Auriol.  Release
me1 oh, release me I'
 In a few moments the it will be passed,'' she rejoined.
 Let us walk towards the abbey.''
It is in in to struggle against fate,'' ejaculated
Auriol, despairingly.
And he suffered himself to be led in the direction pro-
posed.
Abba continued to talk, but her discourse fell upon a
deaf ear, and at last she became silent too. In this way
they proceeded along Millbank-street and Abingdon-street,
until, turning off on the right, they found themselves
before an old and partly-demolished building. By this
time it had become quite dark, for the moon was hidden
behind a rack of clouds, but a light was seen in the upper
story of the structure, oceasioned, no doubt, by a fire within
it, which gave a very picturesque effect to the broken outline
of the walls.
Pausing for a moment to contemplate the ruin, Abba
expressed a wish to enter it. Anriol offered no opposition,
and passing through an arched doorway, and ascending a
short, spiral, stone staircase, they presently married ata
roofless chamber, which it was evident, from the implements
and rubbish lying about, was about to be razed to the
ground. On one side there was a large area, partly
bricked up, through which opened s narrow foray,
though at some height from the ground. With this a

plank communicated, while beneath it lay a great heap of
stones, amongst which were some grotesque cared heads.
In the centre of the chamber was a large square opening,
like the mouth of a trap-door, from which the top of a
ladder projected, and near it stood a flaming brazier, which
had cost forth the glare seen from below. Over the
ruinous walls on the right hung the crescent moon, now
emerged from the cloud, and shedding a ghostly glimmer
on the scene.
 What a strange place'' eriol Abba, gazing around
with some apprehension.  It looks like a spot one reads
of in romance. I wonder where that trap leads to 2''
 Into the vault beneath, no doubt,'' replied Auriol.
 But why did we come hither 7''
As he spoke, there was a sound like mocking laughter,
but whence arising it was difficult to say.
 Did you hear that sound '' cried Auriol.
 It was nothing but the echo of laughter from the
street,'' she replied.  You alarm yourself without reason,
Auriol.'
No, not without reason,'' he cried. ``I am in the power
of a terrible being, who seeks to destroy you, and I know
that he is at hand. Listen to me, Ebbs, and however
strange my recital may appear, do not suppose it the
savings of a madman, but be assured it is the truth.''
 Beware 1'' cried a deep voice, issuing apparently from
the depths of the vault.
 Some one spoke,'' cried Abba. ``I begin to share
our apprehensions. Let us quit this place.''

rEE UnION IN THE FIRST QUARTER 103
 Come, then,'' said Auriol.
t Not seo fast,'' tried a deep voice.
And they beheld the mysterious owner of the black cloak
barring their passage ont.
t Abba, you are mine,'' tried the stranger. ` Auriol
hss brought you to me.''
 It is closE' cried Auriol. ee I never will yield her to
you.''
e Remember your compact,'' rejoined the stranger, with
a mocking laugh.
 Oh, Aurioll'' cried Abba, ' I fear for your soul. Yon
has not made s compact with this fiend'"
. J He has,'' replied the stranger; `" and by that compact
you are surrendered to me,''
And, as he spoke, he advanced towards her, and enelop-
ing her in his cloak, her cries were instantly stifled.
.  Yon shall not gol' tried Anriol, seizing him. : Re-
sense her, or I renounce you wholly.''
4 Fol l'' cried the stranger, ``since you provoke my
wrath, take your doom.''
And he stamped on the ground. At this signal an arm
wasthrust from the trap-door, and Auriol's hand was seized
with an iron grasp.
While this took place, the stranger bore his lovely burden
aw iftly up the plank leading to the narrow doorway in the
wall, and just as he was passing through it he pointed towards
the sky, and shouted with a mocking smile to Auriol-
 Behold the moon is in her first quarter. My words
aro fulfilled1
104
And he disappeared.
AURIOL.
Auriol tried to disengage himself from the grasp im-
posed upon him in vain. Uttering calculations of rage and
despair, he was dragged forcibly backwards into the vault.
OuR morning, to persons took their way along Tarlia-
ment-street and Whitehall, and, chatting as they walked,
turned into the entrance of Spring-gardens, for the purpose
of looking at the statue at Charing-cross. One of them
was remarkable for his dwarfish stature and strange
withered features. The other was a man of middle size,
thin, rather elderly, and with a sharp countenance, to
sourness of which was redeemed by a strong expression of
benevolence. HE was clad in a black coat, rather rusty,
but well brushed, buttoned up to the chin, black tights,
short drug waiters, and wore a white neckcloth and spec-
table.
Mr. Loftus (for so he was called) was a retired merchant,
of moderate fortune, and lived in Abingdon-street. He
was a bachelor, and therefore pleased himself; and being

a bit of an antiquary, rambled about all day long in search
of some object of interest. His walk, on the present
occasion, was taken with that view.
eD Novel what a noble statue that is, MInor1'' cried

timely magnificent.''
 I recollect when the spot was occupied by a gibbet,
and when, in lieu of a statue, an effigy of the martyred

the time of the Protectorate.''
 You cannot get those dreams out of your head, Morse,''
said Loftus, smiling.  I wish I could persuade myself I
had lived for two centuries and a half,''
 Would you could has seen the ancient across, which
once stood there, erected by Edward tho First to his beloved
wife, ' Eleanor of Castile,''' said Morse, needless of the
other's remark.  It was much mutilated when I remember
it; some of the pinnacles were broken, and the foliage
defaced, but the statues of the queen were still standing in
the recesses; and altogether the effect was beautiful,''
It must have been charming,'' observed Loftus, rubbing
his hands; '`and, tough I like the statue, I would much
rather have had the old Gothic cross. But how fortunate
the former escaped destruction in Oliver Cromwell's time.''
 I can tell you how that came to pass, sir,'' replied
Morse, `` for I was assistant to John Rivers, the brazier, to
whom the statue was sold,'
 AhI indeed 1'' exclaimed Loftus. %I have heard some-
thing of the story, but should like to have full particulars.''
 You shall her them, then,'' replied Morse. :Yon
statue, which, as you know, was cast by Hubert le Sueur,
in 1633, was ordered by parliament to be sold and broken

to pieces. Well, my master, John Rivers, being a staunch
royalist, though he did not dare to how his principles,
106
AOl.
determined to preserve it from destruction. Accordingly,
he offered a good round sum for it, and was declared the
purchaser. But how to dispose of it was the difficulty 1
He could trust none of his men but me, whom he knew to
be as hearty a water of the Roundheads, and as loyal to
the memory of our slaughtered sovereign, as himself.
Well, we digged a great pit, secretly, in the cellar, hitler
the state had been conveyed, and buried it. The job
occupied us nearly a month; and during that time, my
master collected together all the pieces of old brass he
could procure. These he afterwards produced, and declared
they were the fragments of the statue. But the cream of
the west was to come. He began to cast handles of knives
and works in brass, giving it out that they were made from
the metal of the statue. And plenty of 'em he sold too,
for the Cavaliers bought 'em as memorials of their martyred
monarch, and the Roundheads as evidences of his fall. In
this way he soon got back his outlay,''
Ha1 ha I ha l'' laughed Loftus.
 All, in due season came the Restoration,'' pursued
MOrse; `` and my master made known to King Charles tha
Second the treasure he had kept concealed for him. It
was digged forth, placed in its old position-but I forget
whether the brazier was rewarded. I rather think not,''
 No matter,'' cried Loftus; '' he was sufficiently re-
awarded by the consciousness of having done a noble action.
Bnt let us go and examine the sculpture on the pedestal
]more closely.''

THE STATUE AT CITING-CROSs. 107
Wh this, he crossed over the road; and, taking off his
hat, thrust his head through the iron railing surrounding
the pedestal, while Morse, in order to point out the beasties
of the sculpture with greater convenience, mounted upon a
stump beside him.
 Yon are aware that this is the work of Grinding Gib-
bons, sir1'' tried the dwarf,
ee To be sure I am,'' replied Loftus-`` to be sure. What
fancy and gusto is displayed in the treatment of these
trophies I'
 The execution of the royal arms is equally admirable,''
cried Morse.
 Never saw anything finer,'' rejoined Loftus-'`never,
upon my lite."
Every one knows how easily a crowd is collected in
London, and it cannot be supposed that our two antiquaries
would be allowed to pursue their investigations unmolosted.
Several ragged urehins got round them, and tried to dis-
cover what they were looking at, at the same time cutting
their jokes upon them. These were speedily joined by
a street-sweeper, rather young in the profession, a ticket-
porter, a butcher's apprentice, an oll Israelites clothes-man,
a coalheaver, and a couple of charity-boys.
My eyes.'' tried the street-sweeper, '`only twig these
codes. If they ain't green 'uns, ITm done.''

marked the porter; ``ve shall hear wot it all means, b-

quite unconscious that he had become the object of general
curiosity.
 Look closer at it, old gem'man,'' tried the porter.
 The nearer you get, the more you'll admire it''
`'Quita true,'' replied Loftus, fancying Morse had spoken;
5ll bear the closest inspection.''
I say, Ned,'' observed one of the charity-boys to the
other, '` do you get over the railing'; tley must hs' dropped

 Why, how the devil did you come here, brother Thor-
bancroft ' cried Loftus, at last recognising him.
 Come along, and TIl tell you,'' replied the iron-mer-
chant, dragging him away, while MOrse followed closely be-
hind them.  Tm so glad to have met you,'' pursued Thor-
bancroft, as soon as they were clear of the mob; "` you'll be
shocked to hear what has happened to your niece, Abba.

 You alarm me. Out with it at once. I hate to be kept
in suspense.''
 She has left me,'' replied Thorneyeroft-t left her old

plied Thorneycroft, mournful. And the thing was so
unnecessary, for I would gladly hne given her to the

graced herself.''
 No, she is too high principled for this,'' period Loftus.
 Rest easy on that score. But with whom has she run

bancroft.  He was brought to my house under peculiar

 What's that to say 7'' tried Thorneycroft, quickly.
I have heard Abba speak of a tall man in a black cloak

that person has nothing to do with her disappearance.''

PREPARATION.
O that same night, at the appointed hour, Mr. Thomney-
croft repaired to Shoreditch, and entering a narrow street
behind the church, speedily discovered the Turk's Head, at
the door of which a hockey-coach was standing. He was
shown by the landlord into a small back room, in which
three men were seated at a small table, smoking, and
drinking in and water, while a fourth was standing near
the fire, with his back towards the door. The Latter was a
tall powerfully-built man, wrapped in s rough great-coat,
and did not turn round on the iron-merchant's entrance.
e You aro punctunl, Mr. Thornoycroft,'' said Ginger,
who was one of the trio at the table; ' and To happy to
say, I've arranged everything' for you, sir. My friends are
ready to undertake the job. Only they don't do it on
quite sich casy terms as mine.''
The Tinker and the Sandman coughcd slightly, to inti-
mate their entire concurrence in MIr. Ginger's remarks,
As 1I said to you this morning', Mr. Thorneycroft,''
pursued Ginger, `` this is a difficult and a dangerous
bus'ness, and there's no known' wot may come on it,
But it's your only chance o' recovering' your carter.''

said Ginger.  So let's be off,
As he spoke, the Tinker and Sandman arose; and the
man in the rough great-coat, who had hitherto remained
with his back to them, turned round. To the iron-mer-
chant's surprise, he perceived that the face of tfiis indi-
vinyl was covered with a piece of black crape.

heard the Tinker and the Sandman take their places near
him, but not remarking the voice of Reeks, concluded that
he must have got outside.
The next moment, the coach was put in motion, and
rattled over the stones at a rapid pace. It made many
turns; but at length proceeded steadily onwards, while
from the profound silence around, and the greater freshness
of the air, Mr. Thorneycroft began to fancy they had gained
the country. Not a word was spoken by any one during
the ride.
After a while, the coach stopped, the door was opened,
and Mr. Thorneyeroft was helped out. The iron-merchant
expected his bandage would now be removed, but he was
mistaken, for Reeks, taking his arm, drew him along at a
quick pace. As they advanced, the iron-merchant's con-
doctor whispered him to be cautious, and, at the same
time, made him keep close to a wall. A door was
presently opened, and as soon as the party had passed
through it, closed.
The bandage was then reroed from Thormneyerof's
eyes, and he found himself in a large and apparently ne-
elected garden. Though the sky was cloudy, there was
light enough to enable him to distinguish that they were
near an old dilapidated mansion.
 We are now arrived,'' said Reeks, to the iron-merchant,
`and you will have need of all your resolution.''
I ill deliver her, or perish in the attempt,'' said
Thorneeroft, taking out his pistols.

The others drew their cutlasses.
 Now then, follow me,'' said Reeks, ``and act as A
direct.'
With this he struck into an alley formed by thick hedges
of print, which brought them to the back part of the
house. Passing through a door, he entered the yard, and
creeping cautiously along the wall, reached a low window,
which he contrived to open without noise. He then passed
through it, and was followed by the others.

WE shall now return to the night of Abba's seizure by
the mysterious stranger. Though almost deprived of con-
seriousness by terror, the poor girl could distinguish, from
the moments of her captor, that she was borne down a
flight of steps, or some steep descent, and then for a con-
sidereal distance along level ground. Shows next place
in a carriage, which was driven with great swiftness, and
though it was impossible to conjecture in what direction
she was coneed, it seemed to her terrified imagination as
if she were hurried down s precipice, and she expected
every moment to be dashed in pieces. At length, the
vehicle stopped, and she was lifted out of it, and carried
along a winding passage; after which, the creaking of
hinges announced that a door was opened. Having passed

mastering her, her senses completely forsook her.
On recovering, she found herself seated on a fauteuil
covered with black velvet, in the midst of a gloomy chamber
of vast extent, while beside her, and supporting her from
falling, stood the mysterious and terrible stranger. HIs
hell a large goblet filled with some potent liquid to her
lips, and compelled her to swallow a portion of it. The
powerful stimulant revived her, but, at the same time, pro-
ducey a strange excitement, against which she struggled
with all her power. Her persecutor again held the goblet
towards her, while a sardonic smile played upon his features.
 Drink :'' he cried; ``it will restore you, and you have
much to go through.''
Abba mechanically took the cup, and raised it to her
lips, but noticing the stranger's glance of exaltation, dashed
it to the ground.
e Yon hase acted foolishly,'' ho sail, sternly; ``the potion
would have done you good.''
Withdrawing her eyes from his gaze, which she felt
exercised an irresistible influence over her, Abbas gazed fear-
fully round the chamber.
It was vast and gloomy, and seemed like the interior of
a sepulchre-the walls and ceiling being formed of black
marble, while the poor was paved with the same material.
Not far from where she sat, on an estrada, approached by
a couple of steps, stood a table covered with black velvet,
on which was placed an immense lamp, fashioned like an
imp supporting a caldron on his outstretched wings. In

this lamp were several berners, which cast a lurid light
throughout the chamber. Oer it hung a cap equally fan-
tactically fashioned. A dagger, with a richly-wrought
hilt, was stuck into the table; and beside it lay a strangely
shaped mask, an open book, an antique instead, and a
piece of parchment, on which some characters were inscribed.
Opposite these stood a curiously-carved ebony chair.
At the lower end of the room, which was slightly elevated
above the rest, hung a large black curtain; and on to
step, in the front of it, were placed two cases of jet.
 WHat is behind that curtain?'' shudleringly demanded
Ebb of her companion.
You will see anon,'' he replied. ' Meanwhile, seat
yourself on that chair, and glance at the writing on the
scroll''
Ebbs did not me, but the stranger took her hand, and
drew her to the seat.
" Read what is written on that paper,'' he cried, im-
seriously.
Ebb glanced at the document, and a rudder passed
over her frame.
By this,'' she cried, "I surrender myself, soul and
body, to you t'
You do,'' replied the stranger.
tI hao committed no crime that can place me within

knees. `'I call upon Heaven for protection Avant''

the lamp, and the chamber was buried in profound darkness.
MOcking laughter rang in her ears, succeeded by wailing
cries inexpressibly dreadful to hear.
Ebbs continued to pray fervently for her own deliverance,
and for that of Auriol. In the midst of her supplications
she was aroused by strains of music of the most exquisite
sweetness, proceeding apparently from behind the curtain,
and while listening to these sounds she was started by a
deafening crash as if as large gong had been stricken. The
cover of the lamp was then slowly raised, and the burners
blazed forth as before, while from the to cases in front of
the curtain arose clouds of incense, filling the chamber with
stupifying fragrance.
Again the gong was stricken, and Abba looked round
towards the curtain. Above each vase towered a gigantic
figure, wrapped in a long black cook, the lower part of
which was concealed by the thick pour. Goods, like the
bowls of monks, were drawn over the heads of these grim
and motionless figures; mufflers enrolled their chins, and
they wore masks, from the holes of which gleamed eyes of
unearthly brightness. Their hands were crossed upon
their breasts. Between them sqnatted two other spectral
forms, similarly cloaked, hooded, and masked, with their
gleaming eyes fixed upon her, and their skinny fingers
pointed derisiely at her.
Behind the curtain was placed a strong light, which
showed a wide staircase of black marble, leading to soma
upper chamber, and at the same time threw the reflection of

 gigantic figure upon the drapery, while a hand, the finger
of which pointed towards her, was thrust from an opening
between its folds.
Forcibly averting her gaze, Cuba covered her eyes with
her hands, but looking up again after a brief space, bcheld
an ebony door at the side resolve upon its hinges, and give
entrance to three female figures, robed in black, hooded and
veiled, and having their hands folded, in a melancholy
manner, across their breasts. Slowly and noiselessly
advancing, they halted within a few paces of her.
 Who, and what are ye 1'' she cried, wild with terror.
 Tho victims of Auriol 1'' replied the figure on the right.
2As we are, such will you bo ere long.''
 What crime have you committed?'' demanded Abba.
 We have loved him,'' replied the second figure.
 Is that a crime'' cried Abba.  If so, I am equally
culpable with you.''
 Yon will share our doom,'' replied the third fire.
t Heaven have mercy upon mel'' exclaimed the agonised
girl, dropping upon her knees.
At this moment a terrible voice from behind the curtain
exclaimed-
Sign, or Auriol is lost for ever.''
e I cannot yield my soul, evren to save him,'' cried Abba,
distractelly.
 Witness his chastisement, then,'' cried the voice.
And as the words were uttered, a side door was opened
on the opposite side, and Auriol was dragged forth from it

by two masked personages, who looked like familiar of the
question.
Do not yield to the demands of this fiend, Abba1
tried Auriol, gazing at her distracted.
wIll yon sao him before he is cast, living, into the
tomb 1'' cried the ice.
Ad at the words, a heavy slab of marble rose slowly
from the floor near here Abba sat, and disclosed a dark
pit beneath.
Abba gazed into the abyss with indescribable terror.
There he will be immune, unless you sign,'' cried the
voice; '` and, as he is immortal, he will endure an eternity
of torture.''
I cannot save him so, but I may precede him,'' cried
Abba. And throwing her hands aloft, she flung herself into
the pit.
A fearful cry resonnded through the chamber. It broke
from Auriol, who only strove to burst from those who
held him, and precipitate himself after Abba
Soon after this, and while Auriol was gazing into the
abyss, a tongue of blue flame arose from it, danced for a
moment in the air, and then vanished. No sooner was it
gone than a figure, shrouded in black habiliments, and
hooded and muffled np like the three other female forms,
slowly ascended from the vault, apparently without support,
and remained motionless at its brink.

The figure bowed its head, but spoke not.
`Sign 1'' thundered the voice. 4 Your attempt at self-
destruction has placed you wholly in a power. SignI''
At this injunction, the figure more slowly towards the
table, and, to his unspeakable horror, Auriol beheld it take]
up the pen and write upon the parchment. He bent for-
ward, and saw that the name inscribed thereon was EdnA]
ITonxYCROFT.
The groan to which he gave utterance was echoed bias
roar of diabolical laughter.
The figure then moved slowly away, and ranged itself
with the other filed forms.
 All is accomplished,'' cried the ice. Away with

On this, a terrible langford was heard; the lights were
extinguished; and Auriol was dragged through the door-
way from which he had been brought forth.
entered,-1800.,
---
OF the night of the 1st of March, 1800, and at a late
hour, a man, wrapped in a large horseman's cloak, and of
strange and sinister appearance, entered an old deserted
house in the neighbourhood of Stepney-green. He was tall,
carried himself very erect, and seemed in the full vigour of
early manhood; but his features had a worn and ghastly
look, as if bearing the stamp of long-indulged and frightful
excesses, while his dark gleaming eyes gave him an ex-
pression almost diabolical.
This person had gained the house from a garden behind
it, and now stood in a large dismantled hall, from which a
broad taken staircase, with curiously-cared canisters, led
to a gallery, and thence to the upper chambers of the habit-
nation. Nothing could be more dreary than the aspect of
the place. The richly-moulded ceiling was festooned with
spiders' webs, and in some places had fallen in heaps upon
the floor; the glories of the tapestry upon the walls were
obliterated by camps; the squares of black and white
marble, with which the hall was paved, were loosened, and

quake beneath the footsteps; the wide and empty fireplace
yawned like the mouth of a cern; the bolts of the closed
windows were rusted in their sockets; and the heaps of
just before the outer door proved that long years had
celaypscd since any one had passed through it.
Taking a dark lantern from beneath his cloak, the indi-
idunal in question gazed for a moment around him, and
then, with a sardonic smile playing upon his features,
directed his steps towards a room on the right, the door of
which stood open.
This chamber, which was large and cased with os, was
wholly unfuruishel, like the hall, and in an equally dining-
dated condition. The only decoration remaining on its
walls was the portrait of a venerable personage in the cap
and gown of Henry the Eighth's time, painted against a
panel-a circumstance which had probably saved it from
destruction-and beneath it, fixed in another panel, a plate
of brass, covered with mystical characters and symbols, and
inscribed with the name prianus e IReugement, 5fra. I.C.
The same name likewise appeared upon a label beneath the
portrait, with the date, 1550.
Pausing before the portrait, the young man threw the
light of the lantern full upon it, and revealed features
somewhat resembling his own in form, but of a severe and
philosophic cast. In the eyes alone could be discerned the
peculiar nnl terrible glimmer which distinguished his own
glances.
After regarding the portrait for some time fielder, h
thus address it:
ThE TOMB OF THE ROSICRUCIAN. 127
 Dost hear me, old ancestor7'' he cried. 4I, the de-
ascendant, Cyprian de Rougemont, call upon the to point out
where the gold is hidden1 I know that thou wert a brother
of the Rosy Cross-one of the illuminati-and midst pene-
rate the mysteries of nature, and enter the region of light.
I know, also, that thou wert buried in this house with a
nst treasure; but though I have made diligent search for
it, and others have searched before me, the grave his never
yet been discovered: Listen to mel Methought Satan
appeared to me in a dream last night, and bede me como
hither, and I should find what I sought. The conditions
he proposed were, that I should either give him my own
soul, or win him that of Auriol Darcy. I assentod. I am
here. Where is the treasure?''
After a pause, he strack the portrait with his clenched
hand, exclaiming, in a loud voice:
 Dost hear me, I say, old ancestor7 I call on the to
give me the treasure. Dost hear, I say 7''
And ho repeated the blow with greater violence.
Disturbed by the shock, the brass plate beneath the pic-
ture started from its place, and fell to the ground.
 WHat is this1'' cried Rougemont, gazing into the
aperture loft by the plate. ` Hal-my invocation has been
heard I
And, snatching up the lantern, he discovered, at the
bottom of a little recess, about two feet deep, a stone, with
non iron ring in the centre of it. Uttering a joyful cry, he
seized the ring, and drew the stone forward without diff-
cult, disclosing an open space beyond it.

AOL.
 This, then, is the entrance to my ancestor's tomb,''
cried Rougemont; '` there can be no doubt of it. The old
Rosicrucian has kept his secret well; but the devil has
helped me to wrest it from him. And now to procure the
necessary implements, in case, as is not unlikely, I should
experience further difficulty.''
With this, he hastily quieted the room, but returned al-
most immediately with a mallet, a lever, and a pitchfork;
armed with with and the lantern, he crept through the
aperture. THis done, he found himself at the head of a
stone staircase, which he descended, and came to the arched
entrance of a vault. The door, which was of stout task, as
locked, but holding up the light towards it, he read the
following inscription:
osr c.o.L. ANO8 PATo, 1550.
In two hundred and fifty years I shall open l'' cried
Rougemont, `' and the date 1350-why, the exact time is
arrived. Old Cyprian must have foreseen what would

happen, and evidently intended to make me his heir.

the moon, around. This, then, was the eer-burning lamp
of the Rosicrucians, and lougemont gazed at it with auto-
punishment. Two hundred and fifty years had elapsed since
with its tail in its mouth-an emblem of eternity-wrought
in purest gold; while taboo it were a pair of silver wing,
in allusion to the soul. Massie chains of the more costly
metal, fashioned like twisted snakes, served as suspenders
to the lamp.
But Rougemont's astonishment at this marvel quickly
gave way to other feelings, and he gazed around the vault
with greedy eyes.
It was a eeptilateral chamber, about eight feet high, built
of stone, and supported by beautifully grained arches. The
surface of the masonry was as smooth and fresh as if the
chisel had only just left it.
In six of the corners were placed large chests, ornamented
with ironwork of the most exquisite workmanship, and these
Rougemont's imagination pictured as filled with inexhans-
title treasure; while in the seventh corner, near the door,
was a beautiful little piece of monumental sculpture in white
marble, representing two kneeling and hooded figures, hold-
in a veil between them, which partly concealed the
entrance to a small recess. On one of the chests opposite
the monument just described stood s strangely-formed
bottle and a cup of antique workmanship, both encrusted
with gems.
The walls were covered with circles squares, and is

grams, and in some places were ornamented with grotesque
carvings. In the centre of the vault was a round altar, of
black marble, covered with a plate of gold, on which Rouge-
mont read the following inscription:
boe uniners cemenuium tnius mihi sepulcrum fec.
 PIero, then, old Cyprian lies,'' he cried.
And, prompted by some irresistible impulse, he seized
the altar by the upper rim, and overthrew it. The heavy
nass of marble fell with a thundering crash, breaking
asunder the flag beneath it. It might be the reverberation
of the vaulted roof, but a deep groan seemed to reproach
the young man for his sacrilege. Undeterred, however, by
this warning, Rongemont placed the point of the lever
between the intoratices of thine broken stone, und, exerting
all his strength, speedily raisel the fragments, and laid open
the grave.
Within it, in the garb he were in life, with his white
beard streaming to his waist, lay the uncoffined body of his
ancestor, Cyprian de Rougemont. The corpse and evidently
been carefully embalmed, and the features were unchanged
by decay. Upon the breast, with the hands placed over it,
lay a large book, bound in black vellum, and fastened with
brazen clasps. Instantly possessing himself of this my-
serious-looking volume, IRougemont knelt upon the nearest
chest, and opened it. But he was disappointed in his
expectation. All the pages he examined were filled with
cabalistic characters, which he was totally unable to de-
cipher.
At length, however, he chanced upon one page, the
TRE STORY OF THE ROSICRUCIAN. 131
import of which he comprehendel, and he remained for
some time absorbed in its contemplation, while an almost
fiendish smile played upon his features.
``Aha l'' he exclaimed, closing the volume, '` I see now
the cause of my extraordinary dream. My ancestor'a
wondrous power was of infernnl origin-the result, in
fact, of a compact with the Prince of Darkness. But
what care I for that? Give mo wealth-no matter what
source it comes from a-ha: nhl''
And seizing the leer, he broke open the chest beside
him. It was filled with bars of silver. The next he
visited in the san way was full of gold. The third was
laden with pearls and precious stones; and the rest con-
gained treasure to an incalculable amount. Rougemont
gazed at them in transports of joy.
 At length I have my wish,'' he series.  Boundless
wealth, and therefore boundless power is mine. I can riot
in pleasure-riot in vengeance. As to my soul, I will run
the risk of its perlition; but it shall go hard if I destroy
not that of Auriol. IIis love of play and his passion for
with Talbot shall be the means by which I will ork. But
I must not neglect another agent which is offered me. That

TE COMPAQ.
Not two months after this occurrence, and near mid-
night, a young man was hurrying along Pall-mall, with a
look of the wildest despair, when his headlong course was
suddenly arrested by a strong grasp, while a familiar voice
sounded in his ear.
ee It is useless to meditate self-destruction, Auriol Darcy,''
cried the person who had checked him.  If you find life a
burden, I can make it tolerable to you.''
turning round at the appeal, Auriol beheld a tall man,
wrapped in a long black cloak, whose sinister features were
well known to him.
 Leave me, Rougemont 1'' he tried, fiercely.  I want
to society-above all, not yours. You know very well that
you have ruined me, and that nothing more is to be got
from me. Leave me, I say, or I may do you a mischief,''
 Tut, tut, Auriol, I am your friend1' replied Rouge-
mont.  I purpose to relieve your distress.''
4 Will you give me back the money you have won from
me1'' cried Auriol.  Will you pay my inexorable cre-
itors1 Will you see me from s prison 7''
 I will do all this, and more,'' replied Rougemont. I
will make you one of the richest men in London.''
TEE CONTACT.
133
Spare your insulting jests, sir,'' cried Auriol. Iam
in no mood to bear them,''
 I am not jesting,'' rejoined Rougemont.  Come with
me, and you shall be convinced of my sincerity.''
Auriol at length assented, and they turned into Saint
James's-square, and paused before a magnificent hose
Rougemont ascended the steps. Anriol, who had accom-
panned him almost mechanically, gazed at him with auto-
isment.
 Do you live here'' he inquired.
Ask no questions,'' replied Rougemont, knocking at
the door, which was instantly opened by a hall porter,
while other servants in rich liveries appeared at a distance.
tougemont addressed a few words in an under tone to
them, and they instantly bowed respectfully to Auriol,
while the foremost of them led the way up a magnificent
staircase.
ALl this was a mystery to the young man, but he followed
his conductor without a word, and was presently ushered

apartment.
The servant then left them; and as soon as he was gone
Anriol exclaimed-` Is it to mock me that you have brought
me hither 2
 To mock you-no,'' replied Rougemont. I have told
you that I mean to make you rich. But you look greatly
exhausted. A glass of wine will review you,''
And as he spoke, he stepped towards a small cabinet,
and took from it a curiously-shaped bottle and a goblt.

ARIEL.
 Taste this wine-it has been long in on family,'' he
added, filling the cup.
t It is as strange, bewildering drink,'' cried Auriol, set-
ting down the empty goblet, and passing his hand before
his eyes.
 Yon have taken it upon an empty stomach-that is
all,'' said Rougemout.  You will be better non.''
I feel as if I were going mad,'' cried Auriol.  It is
some damnable potion you have given me.''
 Ha1 hal'' laughed Rougemont.  It reminds you of
the elixir you once quffed-eh 7'"

he said I am in no mood to bear it

in his manner. e WHat think you of this house ?''
That it is magnificent,'' replied Auriol, gazing around.
I envy you its possession.''
te It shall be yours, if you please,'' replied Rougemont.
 MInute you are mocking me again.''
Not in the least. You shall bny it from me, if you
please.''
At what price?'' asked Auriol, bitterly.
At a price you can easily any,'' replied the other.
 Come this way, and we will conclude the bargain.''
Proceeding towards the farther end of the room, they
entered a small exquisitely-furnished chamber, surrounded
with sofas of the most luxurious description. In the midst
was a table, on which writing materials were placed.

the door. `THis pocket-book will furnish on with them.''
4 Notes to an immense amount 1'' cried Auriol, opening
the pocket-book, and glancing at its contents.
 They are yours, together with the house,'' tried Rouge-
mont, `` if you will but sign a compact with me,''
A compact 1I'' cried Auriol, regarding it with a look
of undefinable terror. Who, and what are you 7''
re Some men would call me the drill'' replied Ronge-
mont, carelessly.  But you know me too well to suppose
that I meritsueh a designation. I offer you wealth. What
more could you require ?"
4 But upon what terms 7'' demanded Anriol.
e The easiest imaginable,'' replied the other. e Yon

And as he spoke, he opened a writing-desk non the
table, and took from it a parchment.
sIt down,'' he added; '` and red this.''
Auriol complied, and as he spanned the writing he be-
came transfixed with fear and astonishment, while the
pocket-book dropped from his grasp.
After a while, he looked up at Rongemont, who was
leaning over his shoulder, and wise features were wrinkled
with a derisive smile.
Then you are the Find7'' he cried.
If you will have it so-certainly,'' replied the other.

e But if I fail in doing so, I am doomed--''
But you will not fail,'' interrupted the other, lighting a
taper, and sealing the parchment. " Now sign it''
Auriol mechanically took the pen, and gazed fixed on
the movement.

Ee muttered.
A stroke of the pen will rescue you from utter ruin,''
said Rougemont, leaning over his shoulder. Riches and
happiness are yours. Yon ill not have such another
chance.''

to the paper. But he instantly started back aghast at the
fiendish laugh that rang in his ears.
I repent-give it me back f'' he tried, endeavouring to
snatch the parchment, which Rougemont thrust into his]
boom.

e It is too late l'' cruel the latter, in a triumphant tone.
4 You are mine-irredeemably mine.''
eEa 1'' exclaimed Anriol, sinking back on the couch.
eI leave you in possession of your house,'' pursued
Rougemont; "` but I shall return in a week, when I shall
require my first victim.''
 Your first victim1 oh, Heaven I'' exclaimed Auriol.
`Ay, and my choice falls on Edith Talbot I'' replied
Rougemont.

It is because she loves you that I have chosen her,''
rejoined Rougemont, with a bitter laugh. :" And such will

our passion will be fatal to the object of it. When the
week has elapsed, I shall require Edith at your hands. TIl
then, farewell l'
 Stay 1' tried Auriol. I break the bargain with the,
fiend. I will have none of it. I abjure thee.''
And he rushed wildly after Rougemont, who had already
gained the larger chamber; but, here he could reach him,
the mysterious individual had passed through the outer
door, and when Auriol emerged upon the gallery, he was
nowhere to be seen.
Several servants immediately answered the franc
hours of the young man, and informed him that Mr,
Rougemont had quieted the house some moments age,

Auriol.
Ol, quite sure, sir,'' cried the hall porter, I helped
him on with his cloak, myself. He said he should return
this day week.''

"mind that. Deny me to him; and on no account what-

IE8OPTION.
139
O returning to the cabinet, where his fatal compact
with Rongemont had been signed, Auriol perceived the
pocket-book lying on the floor near the table, and, taking
it up, he was about to deposit it in the writing-desk, when
an irresistible implies prompted him once more to examine
its contents. UNfolding the roll of notes, he counted
them, and found they amounted to more than a hundred
thousand pounds. The sight of so much wealth, and the
thought of the pleasure and the power it would procure
him, gradually dispelled his fears, and arising in a trans-
port of delight, he exclaimed- es, yes-all obstacles
are now removed When Mr. Talbot finds I am become
this wealthy, he will no longer refuse me his daughter.
But I am mad,'' he added, suddenly checking himself
--'' worse than mad, to indulge such lopes. If it a
indeed the Field to whom I have sold myself, I have no
help from perdition1 If it be man, I am scarcely lees
terribly lettered. In either case, I will not remain hera
longer; nor will I avail myself of this accursed money,
which has tempted to to my undoing.''
And, hurling the pocket-book to the farther end of the
room, he was about to pass through the door, when a

mocking laugh arrested him. Ie looked round with
astonishment and dread, but could see no one. After
while, he again moved forward, but as rice, which he.
recognised as that of Rongemont, called upon him to
stay.
e It will be in vain to fly,'' said the unseen speaker.
 You cannot escape me. Whether you remain here or

not-whether you use the wealth I hae gien on, or
this knowledge, you are at liberty to go. But, remember,
on the seventh night from this I shall require Edith Talbot

 Where are you, fiend 7'' demanded Auriol, gazing
around, furiously. `' Show yourself, that I may confront
you.''
A mocking lang was the only response deigned to this
injunction.
 Give me back the compact,'' tried Anriol, imploring.
" It was signed in ignorance. I knew not the price I was]
to pay for your assistance. Wealth is of no value to me.
without Edith.''
 Without wealth you could not obtain her,'' replied the
voice. `' You are only, therefore, where you were. But
you will think better of the bargain to-morrow Meanwhile,
I counsel on to place the money you have so unwisely cast
from you safely under lock and key, and to seek repose.
Yon will awaken with very different thoughts in the
morning.''

RESOLUTION.
141
4 How am I to account for my sudden accession of
wealth 1'' inquired Auriol, after a pause.
 On a gambler, and ask that question l'' returned tha
unseen stranger, with a bitter laugh.  But I will make
your mind easy on that score. As regards the house, you
will find as regular conveyance of it within that writing-
desk, while the note lying on the table, which bears your
address, comes from me, and announces the payment of a
hundred and twenty thousand pounds to you, as a debt of
honor. You see I have provided against every difficulty.
And now, farewell t''
The voice was then hushed; and though Anriol al-
dressed several other questions to the unseen speaker, no
answer was returned him.
After some moments of resolution, Auriol once more
took up the pocket-book, and deposited it in the writing-
desk, in which he found, as he had been led to expect, a
deed conveying the house to him. He then opened the
note lying upon the table, and found its contents accorded
with what had just been told him. Placing it with the
pocket-book, he locked the writing-desk, exclaiming, `` It
is useless to straggle further-I must yield to fate1''
THis done, he went into the adjoining room, and, casting
his eyes about, remarked the antique bottle and flag.
The latter was filled to the nm-how or with what, Auriol
paused not to examine; but seizing the cup with despera-
tion, he placed it to his lips, and emptied it at a draught

by opium, presently succeeded. ALl his fears left him, and
in their place the gentlest and most delicious fancics arose.
Surrendering himself delighted to their influence, he sank
upon a couch, and for some time was trapped in a dreamy
elysium, imagining himself wandering with Edith Talbot
in a lovely garden, redolent of sweets, and local with the
melody of Birds. Their path led through as grove, in the
midst of which was a fountain; and they were hastening
towards its marble brink, when all at once Edith uttered
a scream, and, starting back, pointed to a large black snake
lying before her, and upon which she would have trodden
the next moment. Auriol sprang forward and tried to
crush the reptile with his heel; but, boiling the blow, it
coiled around his leg, and plunged its venom teeth into
his flesh. The anguish occasioned by the imaginary wound
roused him from his slumber, and looking up, to perceived
that a servant was in attendance.
Bowing obsequiously, the man inquired whether he had
occasion for anything.
4 Show me to my bedroom-that is all I require,'' replied
Anriol, scarcely able to shake off the effect of the vision.
And, getting np, ho followed the man, almost mecha-
nicely, out of the room.
EDITH TALBOT.
Iy.
143
It was late when Auriol rose on the following morning.
At first, finding himself in a large and most laxuriantly-
furnished chamber, he was at a loss to conceive how he
camo there, and it was some time before he could fully recall
the mysterious events of the previous night. As had been
foretold, however, by ougemont, his position did not cansae
him so much anxiety as before,
After retiring himself, he descended to the lower apart-
ments, in one of which s sumptuous breakfast awaited him;
and having partaken of it, he took a complete survey of
the house, and found it larger and more magnificent even
than he had supposed it. He next supplied himself From
the pocket-book with a certain sum, for which e fancied
he might have occasion in the course of the day, and sallicd
forth. His first business was to prepare a splendid carriage
and horses, and to order somo new and rich hasbiliments to
be made with the utmost expedition.
He then proceeded towards May Fair, and knocked at
the door of a large house at the upper end of Curzon-street.
His heart beat violently as he was shown into an elegant
drawing-room, and his trepilation momentarily increased,
until the servant reappeared and expressed his regret that
he had misinformed him in stating that Miss Talbot was

at home. Both she and Mr. TAlbot, he said, had gone out
about half an hour ago. Auriol looked incredulous, but,
without making any remark, departed HIurrying home,
he wrote a few lines to Mr. Talbot, announcing the sudden
and extraordinary change in his fortune, and formally de-
landing the hand of Edith. He was about to despatch
this letter, when a note was brought him by his servant.
It was from Edith. Having ascertained his new address
from his card, she wrote to assure him of her constant at-
attachment. Transported by this proof of her affection,
Auriol half devoured the note with kisses, and instantly
sent off his own letter to her father-merely adding a few
words to say that he would call for an answer on the
morrow. But he had not to wait thus long for a reply.
Ere an hour had elapsed, Mr. Talbot brought it in
person.
Mr. Talbot was a man of about sixty-tall, thin, and
gentleman-like in deportment, with grey hair, and black
eyebrows, which lent considerable expression to the orbs
beneath them. His complexion was a billions brown, and
he possessed none of the good looks which in his daughter
had so captivated Auriol, and which it is to be presumed,
therefore, she inherited from her mother.
A thorough man of the world, though not an amiable
person, Mr. Talbot was entirely influenced by selfish con-
siderutions. He had hitherto looked with an unfavorable
eye upon Auriol's attention to his daughter, from a notion
that the connexion would be very undesirable in a pecuniary
point of view; but the magnificence of the house in Saint
EDITOR TALBOT.
145
James's-square, which fully bore ont Auriol's account of
his newly-acquired wealth, wrought a complete change in
his opinions, and he soon gave the young man to nder-
stand that he should be delighted to have him for a son-
in-la. Finding him so favourably disposed, Auriol en-
treated him to let the marriage take place-within three
days, if possible.
Mr. Talbot was greatly grieved that he would not comply
with his young friend's request, but he was obliged to
start the next morning for Nottingham, and could not
possibly return under three days.
 But we can be married before you go'' cried Auriol.
 Scarcely, I fear,'' replied Mr. Talbot, smiling blindly.
e Yon must control your impatience, my dear young friend.
On the sixth day from this-that is, on Wednesday in next
week-we are now at Friday-you shall be made happy.''
The coincidence between this appointment, and the time
fixed by Rougemont for the delivery of his victim, struck
Auriol forcibly. His emotion, however, escaped Mr. Talbot,
who soon after departed, having engaged his future son-in-
law to dine with him at seen o'clock.
Anriol, it need scarcely be said, was punctual to the hour,
or, rather, ho anticipated it. He found Edith alone in the
drawing-room, and seated near the window, which was filled
with choices flowers. On seeing him, she uttered an ex-
animation of joy, and sprang to meet him. The young
man pressed his lips ferrently to the little and extended
to him.
Edith Talbot was a lovely brunette. Her features were re-
1406
AOL.
large, and her eyes, which were perfectly splendid, were dark,
almond-shaped, and of almost Oriental languor. Her hair
which she wore braided over her brow and gathered behind
in a massive roll, was black and glossy as a raven's wing.
Her clerks were dimpled, her lips of velvet softness, and
her teeth like rages of pearls. Perfect grace accompanied
all her movements, and one only wondered that feet so
mall as those she possessed should hae the power of sus-
training a form which, though lightsome, was yet rounded
in its proportions.
e You have heard, dear Edith, that your father has con-
sent to our union 1'' said Auriol, after going at her for
a few moments in silent admiration.
Edith murmnred an affirmative, and flushed deeply.
 Ie has fixed Wednesday nest,'' pursued Anriol ; `` but
I wish an earlier day could have been named. I have a
presentiment that if our marriage is so long delayed, it will
not take place at all,''
 You are full of misgivings, Auriol,'' she replied.
 I confess it,'' he said; `` and my apprehensions has
risen to such a point, that I feel disposed to urge you to a
private marriage, during your father's absence.''
e Oh, no, Auriol; much as I lore yon, I could never
consent to such a step,'' she tried. 4 Yon cannot urge me
to il. I would not able my dear father'se trusting love.
-I hao nor deceived him, and that is the best assurance
I can give you that I shall never device you.''
Further conversation was interrupted by the entrances

147
of Mr, Talbot, who held out both his hands to Auriol,
and professed the greatest delight to see him. And no
doubt he was sincere. The dinner passed off most plea-
santly, and so did the evening; for the old gentleman was
in high spirits, and his hilarity was communicated to the
long couple. When Auriol and Mr. TAlbot went up-
stairs to teas, they found that Edith's aunt, Mrs. Maitlanl,
had arrived to take charge of her during her father's ab-
since. This lady had always exhibited a partiality for
Auriol, and had encouraged his suit to her niece; cone-
quietly she was well satisfied wth the turn affairs had
taken. It was near midnight before Auriol could tear
himself away; and when he rose to depart, Mr. Talbot,
who had yawned frequently, bnt fruitlessly, to gie him
hint, told him he might depend upon seeing him back on
the evening of the third day, and in the mean time he
committed him to the care of Mrs. Maitland and Edith.
THree days flew by rapidly and delightfully; and on the
evening of the last, just as the little party were assembled
in the drawing-room, after dinner, Mr. Talbot returned
from his journey.
 Well, here I am 1'' he cried, clasping Edith to his
bosom, `` without having encountered any misadventure.
On the contrary, lI hae completed my business to my
entire satisfaction.''
Oh, how delighted I am to see you, dear spa l'' ex-
claimed Edith,. e Now, Auriol, you can have no more ap-
pretensions I'"

AUBIOL.
`Apprehensions of what i'' cried Mr. Talbot.
e Of some accident befalling you, which might have in-
interfere with our happiness, sir,'' replied Ariel.
Oh, lovers are all of idle fears'' tried Mr. Talbot.
 They are unreasonable beings. However, here I am, as
I said before, safe and sound. To-morrow we will finish all
preliminary arrangements, and the day after you shall be
made happy-hal hs1'
 Do you know, papa, Auriol intends to give a grand
ball on our wedding-day, and has invited all his quaint-
ance to it7 remarked Edith.
I hope you have not united Cyprian Rongemont7'
said Mr. Talbot, regarding him fixed.
 I have not, sir,'' replied Auriol, turning pale. But
why do you particulars him 2
 Because I have heard some things of him not much to
his credit,'' replied Mr. Talbot.
 What-what have you herd, sir7'' demanded Anriol.
 Why, one shouldn't believe all the ill one hears of
man; and, indeed, I cannot believe all I have heard of
Carian Rougemont,'' replied Mr. Talbot; `' bat I should
be glad if you dropped his acquaintance altogether. And
now let us change the subject.''
Mr. Talbot seated himself beside Mrs. Maitland, and]
began to give her some event of his journey, which ap-
feared to have been as pleasant as it had been rapid.
Unable to shake off the gloom which had stolen over him,
Auriol took his leave, promising to meet Mr. Talbot at his]

lawyer's in Lincoln's Inn, at noon on the following day.
Ha was there at the time appointed, and, to Mr. Talbot'a
great delight, and the no small surprise of the lawyer, paid
over a hundred thousand ponds, to be settled on his future
wife.
 You are a perfect man of honour, Anriol,'' said Mr.
Talbot, clapping him on the shoulder, `` and I hope Edith
will make you an excellent wife. Indeed, I have no doubt
of it'
s Not I,--if I ever possess her,'' mentally ejaculatod
Auriol.
The morning passed in other preparations. In the
evening the lovers met as usual, and separated with the
full persuasion, on Edith's part at least, that the next day
would make them happy. Since the night of the compset,
Auriol had neither seen Iougemont, nor heard from him,
and he neglected no precaution to prevent his intrusion.
--
150
AURIOI.
It was a delicious morning in May, and the sun shone
brightly on Auriol's gorgeous equipage, as he droro to St.
George's, Another-square, where he was united to Edith.
This far all seemed auspicious, and he thought he could
now bid defiance to fate. With the object of his loe close
beside him, and linked to him by the strongest and holiest
ties, it seemed impossible she could be snatched from
him. Nothing occurred during the morning to give him
uneasiness, and he gave orders that a carriage and four
should bo ready an hour before midnight, to convey him and
his bride to Richmond, where they were to spend their
honeymoon.
Night came, and with it began to arrive to guests who
were hidden to the ball. No expense had been spared by
Auriol to give splendour to his fete. It was in all respects
magnificent. Tho amusements of the evening commenced
with a concert, which was performed by the first singers
from the iTalian Opera; after which, the ball was opened
by Auriol and his lovely bride. As soon as the dance was
over, Auriol made a sign to an attendant, who instantly
disappeared.
 Are you prepared to quit this gay scene with me,
Edith 7'' he asked, with a heart swelling with rapture.

 Quite so,'' she replied, going at him with tenderness;
 I long to be alone with yon.''
t Come, then,'' said Auriol.
Elite arose, ant passing her arm under that of her hus-
band, they quieted the ball-room, but in place of descending
the principal staircase, they took a more private course.
Tho hall, which they were obliged to cross, and which they
entered from a side-door, was spacious and beautifully pro-
portion, and adorned with numerous states on pedestals,
The ceiling was decorated with fresco paintings, and sup-
ported by two stately scagliola pillars. From between these,
a broad staircase of white marble ascended to the upper
room. As Auriol had foreseen, the staircase was thronged
with guests ascending to the ball-room, the doors of which
being open, afforded glimpses of the dancers, and gse forth
strains of liveliest music. Anxious to avoid a newly-arrived
party in the hall, Auriol and his bride lingered for a mo-
ment near a pillar.
Ha1 who is this'' cried Edith, as a tall man, with a
sinister countenance, and painted entirely in black, moved
from the farther side of the pillar, and planted himself in
their path, with his back partly towards them.
A thrill of apprehension passed through Auriol's frame.
Ie looked up and beheld Rougemont, who, glancing over
his shoulder, fixed his malignant gaze upon him. Retreat
was now impossible.,
 Yon thought to delude me,'' said Rougemont, in a
deep whisper, audible only to Auriol; ``but you counted
without your host. I am come to claim my victim,''

But her husband returned no answer. Terror had taken
away his power of utterance.

taking her hand.
' Yo are ming, Auriolt' cried Edith, who scarcely
knew whether to draw back or go forward.
 Yes-yes,'' cried Auriol, who fancied he saw s means
of escape. :THis is my friend, Mr. Rongemont-go with]
him.''
` Mr. Rougenont,'' cried With.  ou told my father.

Your husband did not invite me, madam,'' said Ronge-
ont, with resistive emphasis: ' but knowing I should be
welcome, I came asked. But let us aid those persons.''
In another moment they were at the door. The carriage
was there with its four horses, and a man-servant, in trs-]
selling satire, stood beside the steps. Reassured by the]
sight, Auriol recovered his courage, and suffered Rouge-]
mont to throw a cloak oer Edith's shoulders. The next]
moment she tripped up the steps of the carriage, and was]
ensconced within it. Auriol was about to follow her, when]
he received a violent blow on the chest, which stretched]
him on the payment. Before he could regain his feet,]
Rongemont had sprung into the carriage. The steps were]
instantly put up by the man-servant, who mounted the box]

As the carriage turned the corner of King-street, Anriol,
who had just arisen, beheld, by the light of a lamp,
Rougemont's face at the window of the carriage, charged
with an expression of the most fiendish triumph.
 What is the matter'' cried Mr. Talbot, who had a-
preached Auriol. :I came to bid you good-by. Why do

M. TonxcnorT and his companions had scarcely
gained s passage in the deserted house, which they had
entered in the manner described in a previous chapter,
when they were alarmed by the sudden and furious ringing
of a bell overhead. The noise brought them instantly to
a halt, and each man grabbed his arms in expectation of an
attack, but the real ceasing in a few moments, and all on-
twining diet, they moved on as before, and presently
reached s large hall with a lofty window over the door,
which, being without shutters, afforded light enough to
reveal the dilapidated condition of the mansion.
From this hall four side doors opened, apparently com-
indicating with different chambers, three of which were
cautiously tried by Reeks, but they proved to be fastened.
The fourth, however, yielded to is tough, and admitted
them to a chamber, which seemed to have been recently
occupied, for a lamp ws burning within it. The walls
were panelled with dusky oak, and hung at the lower end

with tapestry, representing the Assyrian monarch Finns,
and is captive Zoroaster, in of the Bactrians. Tha
chief furniture consisted of three large high-backed and
grotesquely-carved arm-chairs, near one of which stood a
powerful electrical machine. squares and circles were
traced upon the floor, and here and there were scattered
cups and balls, and other matters apparently belonging to
a conjuring apparatus.
The room might be the retreat of a man of science, or it
might be the repository of s juggler. But whoever its
occupant was, and whatsoever his pursuits, the good things
of the world were not altogether neglected by him, as was
proved by a table spread with hands, and furnished with
glasses, together with a couple of taper-necked bottles.
While glancing upwards, MIr. Thorneyeroft remarked that
just above each chair the ceiling was pierced with a round
hole, the meaning of which he could not at the time com-
pretend, though after circumstances sufficiently explained
it to him.
4 A singular room,'' he observed to Reeks, on concluding
his surrey. Did you expect to find any one here ?'"
I hardly know,'' replied the other. That bell may
have given the alarm. But I will soon ascertain the point
Remain here till I return.''

croft, easily.

 What are we likely to hear '' asked Thorneycroft, with
increasing trepidation.
THat's impossible to say,'' answered Reeks; '`but I
warn you not to cry out unnecessarily, as such an import-
dence would endanger our safety.''
 Yon are quite sure you don't mean to abandon us t''
persisted Thorneyceroft.
t Make yourself essy; I have no such intention,'' re-
joined Reeks, sternly.
Oh1 e'll take care of you, don't be afraid, old gent,''
said Ginger.
e Yes, we'll take care on yo,'' added the Tinker and the
Sandman.
 You may depend upon them as upon me, sir,'' said
Reeks. : Before we explore the subterranean apartments,
I wish to see whether any one is np-stairs,''

opened.

Advancing a few paces, he listened intently, and hearing
a slight sound in an apartment to the right, he stepped
softly towards it, and placing his eye to the keyhole, beheld
s tall man, dressed in black, pacing to and from with rapid
strides, while three other persons, wrapped in sable gowns,
and disguised with hideous masks, stood silent and motion-
less at a little distance from him. In the tall man he
recognised Cyprian Rongemont. Upon a table in the
middle of the room was laid a large open volume, bound in
black vellum. Near it stood a lamp, which served to ill-
mine the scene.
]-
Suddenly, Rougemont stopped, and turning over several
leaves of the book, which were covered with cabalistio
characters, appeared in search of some magic formula.
Before he could find it, however, a startling interruption
occurred. An alarm-bell, fixed against the wall, began
to ring, and at the same moment the doors of a cabinet
flew open, and a large ape (for such it seemed to Reeks),
clothed in a woollen shirt and drawers, sprang forth, and
bounding upon the table beside Rougemont, placed its
mouth to his ear. The communication thus strangely made
seemed highly displeasing to Rongemont, who knitted his
brown, and delivered some instructions in an under tone to
the monkey. The animal nodded its head in token of
obedience, jumped off the table, and bonded back to the
cabinet, the doors of which closed as before. Rougemont
next took up the lamp, with the evident intention of quit-

158
ting the room, seeing which, Reeks hastily retreated to an
adjoining chamber, the door of which was fortunately open,
and had scarcely gained its shelter when the four mystery-
ons personages appeared on the gallery. Reeks heard
their footsteps descending the staircase, and then, creeping
cautiously after them, watched them across the hall, and
pause before the chamber containing Mr. Thorneycroft and
his companions. After a moments' deliberation, Rouge-
mont noiselessly locked the door, took out the key, and
leaving two of his attendants on guard, returned with the
third towards the staircase.
Without trying to confront them, Reeks started back,
and hurried along the gallery till he came to s back stair-
case, which conducted him, by various descents, to the base-
ment floor, where, after traversing one or two vaults, he
entered a subterranean passage, arched overhead, and having
several openings at the sides, apparently communicating
with other passages. It was lighted at intervals by lamps,
which emitted a feeble sudanese.
By the light of one of these, Reeks discovered the door
of a cell. It was of iron, and as he struck with his hand,
returned a hollow langford. On repeating the blow, a
hoarse voice from within cried, ` Leave me in peace l'
Is it Anriol Darcy who speaks 7'' demanded Reeks.

question 7''

with Mr. Thomnereroft to deliver you.'
Mr. Thorneycroft has come too late. He has lost his
daughter,' replied Auriol.
 What has happened to her ?'' demanded Reeks.
 She is in the power of the Fiend,'' replied Auriol.

eea. ABout what has befallen her ?
She has become like his other victims-like my
victims I' cried Anriol, distracted.
Do not despair,'' rejoined Reeks. :She may yet be
saed.''
 Saed1 how t'' cried Auriul.  All is over.''
 So it may seem to yon,'' rejoined Reeks; ``but you
are the victim of delusion,''
Oh that I could think sol'' exclaimed Auriol. 4Bt
no-I saw her fall into the pit. I beheld her filed figure
rise from it. I witnessed her signature to the fatal scroll.
There could be no illusion in what I then beheld,''
 Despite all this, you will see her again,'' ssid Reeks.
 Who are on who give me this promise ?'' asked Auriol.
As I have already declared, a friend,'' replied Reeks.
' Are you human 7''
t As yourself,''
 Then you seek in vain to struggle with the powers of
darkness,'' said Auriol.

 I have no fear of Oyprian Rougemont,'' rejoined Reeks,
with a lsgh.

e Yon shall know anon,'' replied Reeks. `'But, hist1-
we are interrupted. sOme one approaches,''
Mon than ten minutes had elapsed since Reeks's de-
pasture, and Mr. Thorneycroft, who had hitherto had some
difficulty in repressing his anger, now began to give vent
to it in muttered threats and complaints. His impatience
wss shared by the Tinker, who, stepping p to Ginger,
said--

laughing, '` but ILl relate a circumstance to you as'll pre]
tat wrote your opinion of one location may be, the beak
upholds it.''
Thero can be but one opinion as to your nefarious pro-
session,'' said Mr. Thorneycroft, ``and that is, that it's as
bad as horse-stealing and sheep-stealing, and should be
punished as those offences are punished.''
So I think, sir,'' said Ginger, winking at the others;
: but to my story, and don't interrupt me, or I can get
through with it properly. There's a gent livin' nota
hundred miles from Pall-Mall, as the newspapers says, as
had a favourite Scotch terrier, not worth more nor half-as-
crown to any one but himself, but highly wallerablo to him,
cns it was a favourite. Well, the dog is lost. A pal of
mine gets hold on it, and the gent soon offers a reward for
its recovery. This don't bring it back quito so soon as he
expects, 'cos he don't offer enough; so he goes to an agent,
Mr. Simpkins, in the Edger-road, and Mr. Simpkins says
to him-says he, How are you, sir2 I expected you some
days ago. You've com'd about that are Scotch terrier.
You've got a wallable greyhound, I understand. A man
told me he'd had that afore long.' Seen' the gent

much interested in the relation.
 Only t'other day, I assure yon,'' replied Ginger.
 d shoot the ruffian who treated a dog of mine so, if I
cannot hin1' cried Mr. Thorneyeroft, indignantly.
And are him right, too,'' said Ginger. : I discan-
rages all cruelty to animals. But don't interrupt me
again. After a bit more caffeine' ith Mr. Simpkins, the
gent offers three pound for his dog, and then goes away.
Next day he reads a report in' the Times newspaper that a
man has been taken up for dog-stealing', and that a lot of'
dogs is shut up in the green-yard behind the police-office
in Bow-street. So he goes there in search of' his favourite,
and sure enough he finds it, but the inspector on'to give it
up to him, 'eos the superintendent is on to' the way.''

e Shameful, indeed, sir,'' echoed Ginger, laughing.

the gent sleeps soundly that night, but even he goes back

Ginger.

to m quite satisfied with the present state of the law,'
said Ginger; ``here's the horthy beak1 I'l drink his
health a second time.''
ee Halloa1 wot's that7'' cried the Tinker; ' I thought I
heard a noise,''
the So did I,'' rejoined the Sandman; `'a strange sart o'
rumbling' sound overhead.''
e There it goes again l'' cried Ginger; ` not an awful
din 1
e Now it'a underneath,'' said Mr. Thorneycroft, turning
pale, and trembling.  It sounds as if some hidden ms-
chinery were at work.''
The noise, which up to this moment had borne an india-
tinct resemblance to the creaking of wheels and pulleys, now
increased to a violent clatter, while the house was shaken as
if by the explosion of a mine beneath it.
At the same time, the occupants of the chairs received
a sharp electrical shock, that agitated every limb, and
caused Mr. Thorneyeroft to let fall lis pistol, which went
off as it reached the ground. At the same time, the Sand-
man dropped his goblet, and the Tinker relinquished his
grasp of the cutlass. Before they could recover from the
shock, all three were caught by stout woolen hooks, which,
detaching themselves from the back of the chairs, opinion
their arms, while their legs were restrained by fetters, which
sprang from the ground and clasped round their ankles.
Thus fixed, they struggled mainly to get free. The chairs
168

seemed nailed to the ground, so that all efforts to move
them proved futile.
But the worst was to come. From the holes in the cell-
in already alluded to, descended three hey bell-shaped
helmets, fashioned like those worn by divers at the bottom
of the sea, and having round eyelet-holes of glass. It was
evident, from the manner of their descent, that the
helmets must drop on the head of the sitters-a convict-
tion that filled them with irrepressible terror. They shouted,
and swore frightfully ; but their vociferations advised them
nothing.  Down came the helmet, and the same moment,
the monkey which had been seen by Reeks issued from a
cupboard at the top of a cabinet, and grinned and hibberd
at them.
Down came the first helmet, and covered the Tinker to
the shoulders. His appearance was at once ludicrous and
terrible, and his roaring within the casque sounded like the
bellowing of s baited bull.
Down came the second helmet, though rather more slowly,
and the Sandman was eclipsed in the same manner as the
Tanker, and roared as loudly.

In both these instances the helmets had dropped without
guidance, bat in the case of Mr. Thorneyeroft, a hand,
thrust out of the hole in the ceiling, held the helmet sus-
ended over his head, like the sword of Damocles. While]
the poor iron-merchant momentarily expected the same]

towards the monkey, which, clinging with one hand to the
side of the cabinet, extended the other skinny arm towards
him, and exclaimed--t Will you swear to go hence if you
are spared 7''
%No, I will not,'' replied the iron-merchant. He had
scarcely spoken, when the helmet fell with a jerk, and ex-
extinguished in like the others.
Ginger alone remained. During the whole of this strange
scene, he had stood with the bottle in hand, transfixed
with terror and astonishment, and wholly unable to move
or cry out. A climax was put to his right, by the descent
of the three chairs, with their occupants, through the floor
into a vault beneath; and as the helmets were whisked up
again to the ceiling, and the trap-doors closed upon the
chairs, he dropped the bottle, and fell with his face upon
the table. He was, however, soon roused by a poll at his
hair, while a shrill voice called him by his name.
 Who is it1'' groaned the dog-fancier.
 Look up l'' cried the speaker, again plucking his hair.
Ginger complied, and beheld the monkey seated beside
him.

the throat-'`your master may be the devil, bnt yon're

All squeeze your windpipe for yon.''

Parr, twisting himself like an eel out of the other's gripe.
Now get out, if you can.''
Don't be angry,'' cried Ginger, seeing the mistake la
had committed, and trying to conciliate him; ` I only meant
to frighten you a bit. Can you tell me if MIr, Auriol Darcy
is here 2'
e Yes, he is, and a close prisoner,'' replied Old Parr.
'And the girl-Miss Webber, lot of her 1''
I can't say,'' rejoined Old Parr. "I can only speak to
the living.'

e That's a secret,'' replied the dwarf, mysteriously; `and
Tm bound by a terrible oath not to disclose it.''

Ginger. I wish you would lend to a knock on the

behind it, through which he passed, and beckoned Ginger
to follow him. Taking a pistol from his pocket, the latter
complied.

BrFon the chair, in which Mr. Thorneyeroft ws fixed,
reached the ground, terror had taken away his senses. A
bottle of salts, placed to his nose, revived him after a time;
but he had nearly relapsed into sensibility on seeing to
strange figures, in hideous masks and sable cloaks, stand-
in on either side of him, while at a little distance was a
third, who carried a strangely-fashioned lantern. He looked
round for his companions in misfortune, but, though the
chairs were there, they were unoccupied.
The masked attendants paid no attention to the iron-
merchant's cries and entreaties; but as soon as they thought
him able to me, they touched a spring, which freed his
arms and legs from their bondage, and rising him, dragged
him out of the vault, and along a narrow passage, till they
came to a large spulchral-looking chamber, messed with
black marble, in the midst of which, on a velvet fauteuil of
the same hue as the walls, sat Oyprian Rongemont. It

was, in fact, the chamber where Abba had been subject to
her terrible trial.

Bewildered with terror, the poor in-merchant threw
himself at the fact of Rongemont, who, eyeing him with a
look of malignant triumph, cried,

And at the words, the large black curtains at the farther
end of the room were suddenly withdrawn, and discovered
the figure of Abba Thorneyeroft. standing at the foot of the
marble staircase. Her features were as pale as death; her
limbs rigid and motionless; but her eyes blazed with peter-
natural light. On beholding her, MIr. Thorneyeroft uttered
a loud cry, and, springing to his feet, would hae rashed
towards her, but he was held back by the two masked
attendants, who seized each arm, and detained him by main
force.

But she appeared wholly insensible to his cries, and re-

And, followed by the attendants, who dragged Mr.

well. Touching the heavy iron door, it instantly swung
open, and disclosed Auriol chained to a stone at the farther
corner of the narrow chamber.
Not a word was spoken for some minutes, but the cases]

Auriol. I warned her that to love me would be fatal to
her. I told her I was linked to an inexorable destiny,
which would involve her in its meshes-but in vin.''

Rougemont, ` fled-whatever you are, complete your

your present distress. Bid a lasting farewell to Auriol.

ward.
The crape was gone from his brow, and in its place was
seen the handsome and resolute features of a man of middle
life. He held as pistol in either hand.

him;  the brother of Clara, my second victim 1'
 It is,'' replied the other.  Your deliverance is at
hand, Auriol.''

tried Rougemont, stamping the ground with rage. F Re

and you shall share his fate.''

with a scornful laugh. A Yon hae employed your arts

 Fre I' cried Rougemont, drawing himself up to his
towering height.  No earthly ballets can injure me.''

moment behind Pastor.
And he discharged s pistol, with a deliberate aim, at the
breast of Rougemont. The latter remained erect, and
apparently uninjured.
 You see how ineffectual your weapons are,'' ssid
Rongemont, with a derisive laugh.

But before he would draw the triggers, the pistols were
wrested from his grasp by the two attendants, who had

who next opinion his arms.
IV.
So bewildered was the poor iron-merchant by the strange
and terrible events that had befallen him, that, though
released by the two masked attendants, who left him, as
before related, to seize Gerard Payton, he felt utterly
incapable of exertion, and would probably have made no
effort to regain his freedom, if his cont had not been
vigorously placed behind, while a low once urged him to
fly. Glancing in the direction of the friendly speaker, he
could just discern a diminutive object standing within the
entrance of a side-passage, and reared up against the wall
so as to be out of sight of Rougemont and his attendants.
It was the monkey-or rather Old Parr-who, continuing
to tug violently at his cont, at last succeeded in drawing
him backwards into the passage, and then grasping his
head tightly, hurried him along it. THe passage was

wholly delighted, beat Mr. Thorneyeroft would receive that
it was exceedingly circuitous, and winded round likes
 Where are you taking met'' he injured, attempting
to stop.
`` Ask no questions,'' rejoined the dwarf, pulling him
along.  Do you want to be captured, and shut up in a
cell for the rest of your life 7"
 Certainly not'' replied Thorneyeroft, accelerating his
movements; ' I hope there's no changes of it''
 There's every chance of it,'' rejoined Old Pair.  If
your taken, you'll share Arion's fate.''
te Oh, Lord1 I hope not,'' groaned the iron-merchant.
 I declare, you frighten me so much that you take away
all power of movement. I shall drop in a minute.''
 Come along, I say,'' screamed the dwarf.  I hear
them close behind us.''
And as he spoke, shouts, and the noise of rapidly-
approaching footsteps, resounded along the passage.
 I can't stir another step,'' gasped the iron-merchant
 Tm completely done. Better yield at onco.''
 What, without a struggle'' period the dwarf, tannt-
singly.  Think of your daughter, and let the thought of
her nerve your heart. She is lost for ever, if you don't
get out of this accursed place,''

despairingly.

4 No-she may yet be shared,'' rejoined the dwarf.
 Come on-come on-they are close behind us.''
And it was evident, from the increased solomon, that
their pursuers were upon them.
Roused by the imminence of the danger, and by the
hope of rescuing his daughter, Mr. Thorneycroft exerted all
his energies, and sprang forward. A little farther on, they
were stopped by a door. It was closed; and venting his
disappointment in a scream, the dwarf searched for the
handle, but could not find it.
 Wo are entrapped-we shall be caught,'' he cried,
t and then we to both of us. Fool that I was to attempt
your preservation. Better I had left you to rot in a dun-
geon than have incurred Rongemont's displeasure.''
The iron-merchant replied by a groan.
 It's all over with me,'' he said. `I give it up--TIl

m No-we are saved,'' tried the dwarf, as the light, now
flashing strongly upon the door, revealed a small iron
button within it,-'` saved-saed I"
As he spoke, o pressed against the button, which
most a spring, and the door flew open. Just as they
passed through it, the to masked attendants came in

a bolt on the side next him, shot it into the socket.

finding it bolted, presently censed their efforts, and app-
gently withdrew.

it more difficult to get out than I did to get in. How this
passage twists about. I declare we seem to be returning
to the point we started from.''

Why, it does seem very strange, I must say,'' remarked
the dwarf, coming to a halt.  I could almost fancy that
the solid stone walls were moving around us.''

his hand. I feel 'em. Lord hao mercy upon us, and
deliver us from the power of the Oil One''
The place seems on fire,'' tried to dwarf. :A thick
smoke fills the passage. Don't you perceive it, Mr.

coughing and sneezing. e I feel as if I were in a room

his ease.  e shall soon be out of the smoke.'"

come to that long ago. But what new difficulty has
arisen 7"

suffocating-help to drag me ot.''
Get out if you can,'' cried the voice that had just
spoken.
 It'a Rougemont himself,'' cried the dwarf, in alarm.
Then there's no escape.''
None whatever, rascal,'' replied the unseen speaker.
4I want you. I had more work for you to do.''
I won't leave MIr. Thorneyeroft,'' tried the dwarf,
resolutely.  Tre promised to preserve him, and Will keep
my word.''
ee Fool I'' cried the other.  You must obey when I
command,''
And as the words were uttered, a hand was thrust down
from above, which, grasping the dwarf by the name of the
neck, drew him upwards.
" Lay hold of me, Mr. Thorneyeroft,'' screamed Old
Parr.  Im going p again-lay hold of me-pall mo]

Well-nigh stifled by the thickening and pungent
vapour, the poor iron-merchant found compliance impose-

along the passage, expecting every moment to drop, until
at length a current of fresh air blew in his face, and
enabled him to breathe more freely. Somewhat revived,

was planted at one side, and by this Mr. Thorneycroft
descended, but scarcely had he set foot on the ground,

from under the archway. The next moment, however, he
was released, while the familiar voice of the Tinker ex-
claimed,

merchant. 4wHo's that you're not with you ?''

he kicked and pushed against the door, but all is efforts
were unaailing to burst it open.
At the same time the Sandman rushed towards the
ladder, but before he could mount it all egress by that
means was cut off. An immense iron cover worked in a
grove was pushed by some unseen machinery over the top
of the pit, and enclosed them in it.
For several hours deep sleep, occasioned by some potent
predicament, had bond up the senses of Auriol. On
awaking, he found himself within as well, the walls, the floor,
and the ceiling of which were of solid stone masonry. In
the midst of this chamber, and supporting the ponderous
roof, stood a massive granite pillar, the capital of which
was grotesqucly ornamented with death's-heads and cross-
bones, and against this pillar leaned Auriol, with his left
arm chained by heavy links of iron to a ring in the adjoin-
ing wall. Beside im stood a pitcher of water, and near
him lay an antique-looking hook, bound in black vellum.
The dungeon in which he was confined was circular in form,
with a loved roof, sustained by the pillar before mentioned,

and was approached by a steep flight of steps rising from
a doorway, placed somo six feet below the level of the
chamber, and surmounted by a pointed arch. A stream of
light, descending from a narrow aperture in the roof, foll
upon his wasted and haggard features. His dark brown
hair hung about his face in elf-locks, his beard was un-
trimmed, and a fixed and stony group like that of insanity
sat in his eye. He was seated on the ground-neither
bench nor stool being allowed him-with his hand support-
in his chin. His game was fixed upon vacancy-if that
can be called vaccine, which to him was filled with vivid
images. His garb was not that of modern times, but con-
sister of a double and those of rich material, wrought in
the fashion of Elizabeth's days.
After remaining for some time in this musing attitude,
Anriol opened the old tome before him, and began to turn
over its leaves. It was full of magical disquisitions and
mysterious characters, and he found inscribed on one of its
earlier pages a name which instantly riveted his attention.
HAving vainly sought some explanation of this name in the
after contents of the book, he said it aside, and become lost
in meditation. His reserve ended, ho heaved a deep sigh,
and turned again to the open volume lying before him, and
in doing so his eye rested for the first time on his habilis-
ments. On beholding them he started, and held out his
arm to examine his sleeve more narrowly. satisfied that
he was not decried, he arose and examined himself from

in the garb of a gentleman of Elizabeth's time.
e What can this mean 7'' he cried.  Have I endured
long and troubled dream, during which I have fancied my-
]solf living through more than two centuries7 Oh, Heaven,
that it may be sol Of, that the fearful crimes I suppose
I have committed have only been enacted in a dream Of,
]that my victims are imaginary Oh, that Abba should
only pro a lovely phantom of the night And yet, I
could almost wish the rest were real-so that she might
exist. I cannot bear to think that she is nothing more
than a vision. But it must be so-I have been dreaming
--and what a dream it has been a-what strange glimpses
it has afforded me into maturity1 Methought I lived in
the reigns of many sovereigns-beheld one of them carried
to the block-saw resolutions convulsed the kingdom-old
dynasties shaken down, and new ones spring up. Fashions
seems to me to have so changed, that I had clean forgotten
the old ones; while my fellow-men scarcely appeared the
same as heretofore. Can I be the same myself2 Is this
the trees I once wore2 Let me seek for some proof''
And thrusting his hand into his doublet, he drew forth
ome tablets, and hastily examined them. They bore his
name, and contained some writing, and he exclaimed along
with joy, ` This is proof enough-I have been dreaming
all this while.'

stationed at the foot of the steps springing from the door-
ay. and who, though concealed from view himself, was
watching the prisoner with a malignant and exulting gaze.
e And yet, why am I here 7'' pursued Auriol, looking
around. " Ah1 I see how it is,'' he added, with a shudder;
4I have been made-perhaps a mad still. That will
account for the strange delusion under which I have
laboured.''

There was another pause, during which the listener in-
lulged in a suppressed fit of laughter.
 Would I could look forth from this dungeon,'' pursued
Auriol, again breaking silence, ``and satisfy myself of the
truth or falsehood of my doubts by a view of the external
world, for I am so perplexed in mind, that if I were not
distracted already, they would be enough to drive me so.

would opiate my offences by a life of penance.''
Mt this moment Rougemont, attired in a dress similar to
that of the prisoner, marched up the stops, and cried,

became impatient for the appearance of his keeper, but hour
after hour passed and he did not arrive. Worn out, at
length, with doubt and bewildering speculations, the mise-
rable captive was beset with the desire to put an end to his
torments by suicide, and he determined to execute his fell
purpose without delay. An evil chance seemed also to the-
friend him, for scarcely was the idea formed, than his foot
encountered something on the ground, the rattling of which
attracted his attention, and stopping to take it up, he
grasped the bare blade of a knife.

full intent to strike, but before he could inflict the slightest
wound, his arm was forcibly arrested.
 Would you destroy yourself, madman 1' roared a
voice. I thought your violence was abated, and that you
might go forth in safety. But I find you are worse than
ever.''
Auriol uttered a groan and let the knife fall to the ground.
The new comer kicked it to a distance with his foot.
e You shall be removed to another chamber,'' he pursued,
t where you can be more strictly watched.''
 Take me forth-oh I take me forth,'' cried Anriol. exIt
was a mere impulse of desperation, which I now repent.''
I dare not trust you. You will commit some act of
insane fury, for which I myself hall have to bear the
blame. When I yielded to your entreaties on a former
occasion, and took you forth, I narrowly prevented yon
from doing all we met a mischief.''
I have no recollection of any such circumstance,''
returned Auriol, mournful. But it may be true, never-
theless. And if so, it only proves the lamentable condition
to which I am reduced-memory and reason gone''
' By, both gone,'' cried the other, with an irrepressible
chuckle.
 Ha 1'' exclaimed Anriol, starting. I am not so mad
but I recognise in you the Evil Being who tempted me.
I am not so oblivious as to forget our terrible interviews.''

fiercely.  Nsa, then I must call my assistants, and bind]
you.''
Let me be-let s be t'' implored Auriol, `` and I will
offend yon no more. Whatever thoughts may arise within]
me, I will not give utterance to them. Only take me
forth.''

repeat, I dare not. You are not sufficiently master of
yonrsalft.'
tRy to,' said Anriol.
 Well,'' rejoined the other, ``I will see what I can dot
com you.''
So saying, he disappeared for a few moments, and then
returning with as torch, placed it on the ground, and pro-
during a phil, handed it to the capture.
 Drink :' he said.
Without a moment's hesitation Auriol complied.
It seems to me rather a stimulant than a soothing
potion,'' he remarked, after emptying the phil.
You are in no condition to judge,'' rejoined the other.
And he proceeded to tungsten Auriol's chain.
Now then, come with me,'' he said, ``' and do not make
any attempt at evasion, or you will rae it''
Like one in a dream, Auriol followed his conductor down
the flight of stone steps leading from the dungeon, and
long a narrow passage. As he proceeded, he thought he

heard stealthy footsteps behind him; but he never turned
his head, to see whether he was really followed. In this
way they reached a short steep staircase, and, mounting it,
entered a vault, in which Rougemont paused, and placed
the torch he had brought with him upon the for. Its
lurid glimmer partially illumined the chamber, and showed
that it was built of stone. Rude benches of antique form
were set about the vault, and motioning Auriol to be seated
upon one of them, Rougemont sounded a silver whistle.
The summons was shortly afterwards answered by the
dwarf, in whose attire as new change had taken place. He
was now clothed in a perkin of grey serge, fashioned like
the garments worn by the common people in Elizabeth's
reign, and wore a trenches-cap on his head. Auriol
watched him as he timely advanced towards Rlougemont,
and had an indistinct recollection of having seen him
before; but could not call to mind how or where.
Is your master a-bed 3'' demanded Rougemont.
A-bed1 Good lack, girl'' exclaimed the dwarf, `Little
of sleep knows Dr. Lamb. He will toil at the furnace till
the stars have set,''
e Dr. Lamb l'' repeated Auriol.  Rarely I have heard
that name before 2'"
 Very likely,'' replied Rougemont, ``for it is the name
borne by your nearest kinsman.''

glaring commiseratingly at Airiol.  My master often
makes inquiries after his grandson, and relieves that the
state of his mind should render it necessary to confine
him.''
His grandson1 I-Dr. Lamb's grandson 1'' cried
Auriol.
 In south are you, young sir,'' returned the dwarf.
4 Were you in your reason, you would be aware that my
master's name is the same as your own-Darcy-Reginald
Darcy. He assumes the name of Doctor Lamb to delude
the multitude. He told you as much yourself, sweet sir, if
your poor wits would enable you to recollect it,''
Am I in a dream, good fellow, tell me that1' tried
Auriol, lost in amazement.
`Black, no, sir,'' replied the dwarf; 'to my thinking,
you are wide awake. But you know, sir,'' he added,
touching his forehead, `` you have been a little wrong here,
and your memory and reason are not of the clearest.''
 Where does my grandsire dwell '' asked Auriol.
 why here, sir,'' replied the dwarf; '' and for the matter
of locality, the house is situated on the south end of
London-bridge.'
 On the bridge-did you say on the bridge, friend7'
cried Auriol.
'As, on the bridge-where else should it but You
would not have your grandsire lie under the river 2''

rejoined the dwarf; `` though, for ought I know, some of
these vaults may go under it. They are damp enough.''
Auriol was lost in reflection, and did not observe a sign
that passed between the dwarf and Rougemont.
IiI it disturb Dr. Lamb if his grandson goes up to
him 1'' said the latter, after a brief pause.
 My master does not like to be interrupted in his opera-
tions, as you know, sir,'' replied the dwarf, `` and seldom
suffers any one, except myself, to enter his laboratory; but
I will make so bold as to introduce Master Anriol, if he
desires it'
 You will confer the greatest favour on me by doing
so,'' cried Auriol, rising.
 Sit down-sit down I'' said Rougemont, suthoritativrely.
 Yon cannot go up till the doctor has been apprised. Re-
main here, while Snapdragon and I ascertain his wihee.''
So saying, he quieted the chamber by a farther outlet with
the dwarf.
During the short time that Auriol was left alone, he
found it vain to attempt to settle his thoughts, or to con-
vince himself that he was not labouring under some strange
delusion.
He was around at length by the dwarf, who returned
alone.
 Your grndsire will see on,'' said the manning.
 One word before we go,'' cried Auriol, seizing his arm.

e Pardon me,'' replied Ariel; `I ment not to alarm
yo. Where is the person who brought me hither 2
 What, your keeper 2'' said the dwarf.  Oh, he is
within call. He will come to you anon. Now follow
me.''
And taking up the torch, he led the way out of the
chamber. Mounting a spiral staircase, apparently within
a turret, they came to a door, which being opened by Flap-
dragon, disclosed a scene that well-nigh stupified Auriol.
It was the laboratory precisely as he had seen it abba
two centuries ago. The floor was strewn with alchemieal
implement-the table was covered with mystic parchments
inscribed with cabalistic characters-the furnace stood in
the corner-crucibles and cucurbites decorated the chimney-
board--the sphere and brazen lamp hung from the ceiling-
the skeletons grinned from behind the chimney-corner-all
as there as he had seen it before There also was Doctor
Lntb, in his loose gown of sable silk, with a square black
casp upon his venerable head, and his snowy beard streaming
to his girdle.
The old man's gaze wass fixed upon a crucible placed
upon the furnace, and he was occupied in working the
bellows. Ho moved his head as Anriol entered the chamber,

and the features became visible. It was a face need to be
forgotten.
e Come in, grandson,'' said the old man, kindly. ' Come
in, and close the door after you. The draught affects the
furnace-my Author, as we adepts term it. o yon ase
better, your keeper tells me--much better.''
 Are you indeed living'' cried Auriol, rushing wildly
towards him, and attempting to take his hand.
 Of,-off' cried the old man, drawing back as if
alarmed. Yo disturb my operations. Keep him com,
Flapdrasgon, or take him hence. He may do me a mischief.''
e I have no such intention, sir,'' ssid Anriol;  indeed
I have not. I only wish to be asked that you are my
aged relative.''
4 To be sure he is, young sir,'' interposed the dwarf.
s Why should you doubt it1
e Oh 1 sir,'' cried Auriol, throwing himself at the old
man's feet, ``pity me if I am msd; but offer me some
explanation, which may tend to restore me to my senses.
My reason seems gone, yet I appear capable of receiving
impressions from external objects. I see you, and appear
to know yo. I see this chamber-these alchemical simple-
ments-that furnace-these different objects-and I appear
to recognise them. Am I decried, or is this real 7'"

me before. It would be useless to explain to you of so
you have suffered from fever, and what visions your delirium
is produced. When you are perfectly restored, we will
talk the matter over,.''
And, as he said this, he began to blow the fire anew,
and watched with great apparent interest the changing
]colours of the liquid in the cucurbite placed on the furnace.
Anriol looked at him earnestly, but could not catch
another glance, so intently was the old man occupied. At
length he ventured to break the silence.
 I should feel perfectly convinced, if I might look forth
from that window,'' he said.
 Convinced of what'' rejoined the old man, somewhat
sharply.
e That I am what I seem,'' replied Auriol.
 Look forth, then,'' said the old man. 4 But do not
disturb me by idle talk. There is the rosy colour in the
projection for which I have been so long waiting.''
Auriol then walked to the window and gazed through th
.tinted panes. It was very dark, and objects could only be

imperfeetly distinguished. Still he fancied he could detect
the gleam of the river beneath him, and what seemed a
long line of houses on the bridge. He also fancied he
discerned other buildings, with the high roofs, the gables,
and the other architectural peculiarities of the structures
of Elizabeth's time. He persuaded himself, also, that he

could distinguish through the gloom the venerable Gothi
pile of Saint Paul'a Cathedral on the other side of the
water, and, as if to satisfy him that he was right, s deep
solemn bell tolled forth the hour of two. After a while he
returned from the window, and said to his supposed grand-
sire, `I am satisfied. I have lived centuries in a few
nights.''

Sir Lionel Flamstead. I have called it a dining-room, from
its ordinary application to the purposes of reflection and
festivity; but it had much more the air of a library, or
study. It was a small comfortable chamber, just large
enough to contain half a dozen people, though by manage-
ment double that number had been occasionally squeezed
into its narrow limits. The walls were decorated with
curious old prints, maps and plans, set in old black worm-
eaten frames, and representing divers personages, places,
and structures connected with London and its history.

Over the mantelpiece was stretched Verne's copy of
alpha Aggas's famous survey of our ``great metropolis,''
made about the beginning of Elizabeth's reign, or perhaps
a little earlier, when it was scarcely so great a metropolis
as at the present time, and when novelists, gentlemen of the
press, carmen, omnibus cars, and other illustrious per-
sonages were unborn and unreacted of; when St., Giles's,
in lieu of its mysterious and Dealing Seen Dials (which

roundel by a grove of elms; when a turreted wall gilded
in the City, from Aldgate to Grey Friars; when a pack of

of hay-carts and hay-stacks at the other; when the Thames
was crossed by a single bridge, and that bridge looked like
a street, and the street itself like as row of palaces. On the
right of this plan hung a sketch of WIl Somers, jester to
Henry VIII., after the picture by Holbein; on the left an
engraving of Geoffrey Hudson, the diminutive attendant ot
Henrietta Maria. This niche was devoted to portraits of
the bluff king before mentioned, and his six spouses; that
to the melancholy Charles and his family. Here, the Great
Fire of 1666, with its black profiles of houses, relieved by
a sheet of '` bloody and malicious'' flame, formed as pleasant
contrast to the icy wonders of the Frost Fair, held on the
THames in 1684, when carriages were driven through the
lines of tents, and an ox was roasted on the water, to the
infinite delectation of the citizens. There Old Saint Paul'a
(in the words of Victor Hugo, `' one of those Gothic menu-
ments so admirable and so irreparable''), and which is but
ill replaced by the modern ``' bastard counterpart'' of the
glorious fane of St. Peter at Rome, reared its venerable
tower (not dome) and lofty spire to the sky. Next to St.
Paul's came the reverend Abbey of Westminster, taken
before it had been disfigured by the towers adde by Wren;
and next to the abbey opened the long and referred vista of
its magnificent neighbouring hall. Several plans and
prospects of the Tower of London, as it appeared at
different epoehs, occupied a corner to themselves: then

tions rose before you, as you gazed around. Barely an
old edifice, to which an historical tradition could be attached
(and what old London edifice is destitute of such traditions7),
was wanting. Nor were the great of old--the spirits, who
gave interest and endurance to these decayed, or decaying
structures, wanting. But I shall not pause to enumerate
their portrait, or make out a catalogue as long as the list
of Homer's slips, or the gallery of Mr. Lodge. Sufficient
has been said, I trust, to give the reader an idea of the
physiology of the room. Yet stay1 I must not omit a
point on the contents of those groaning shelves. In the
goodly folios crowded there are contained the chronicles of
Holinshed and Hall; of Grafton, Fabian, and Stow; of
Mathew of Paris, and his namesake of Westminster. Let
him not be terrified nt the ponderous size of these admirable
old historians, nor be deterred by the black letter, if he
hold chance to open a volume. Their freshness and pic-
treasure details will surprise as much as they will delight
him. From this wealthy mine Shakspeare drew some of his
purest ore. The shelves are crowned by a solitary bust. It
is that of a modern. It is that of a lower of London, and
a character of London. It is Docros ones.

bowl, must not pass unmentioned. They were in the full
low of fun and conviviality; enjoying themselves as good
follows always enjoy themselves at `'` the season of the year.''
The port was delectable-old as Saint Paul's, I was going
to say-not quite, however-but just `` old enough;'' the
claret was nectar, or, what is better, it was Lafitte; tho
punch was drink for the gods. The jokes of this party
would have split your sides--their laughter would have had
the sense effect on your ears. Neer were heard peals of
merriment so hearty and prolonged. You only wondered
low they found time to drink, so quick did each roar follow
on the heels of its predecessor. That they did drink, how-
over, was clear; that they had drunk was equally certain;
and that they intended to continue drinking seemed to come
within the limits of probability.
Sir Lionel Flamsteed was a retired merchant-one of
those high-fouled, high-principled traders, of whom our
City was one so justly proud, and of whom so few, in these
days of railway bubbles, and other harebrained specula-
tions, can bo found. His word was his bond-once passed,
it was sufficient; his acceptances were accounted safe as
the Bank of England. Had Sir Thomas Gresham descended
from his niche he could not have been treated with greater
consideration than attended ir Lionel's appearance on
'Change. All eyes followed the movements of his tall and
stately figure-nll hats were raised to his courteous but
eceremonious salutation. Affable, yet precise, and tinetnrel

with something of the punctilionsness of the old school, his
manners won him universal respect and regard, een from
those unknown to him. By his intimates he was revered.
His habits were as regular as clockwork, and the glass of
cold punch at Tom's, or the basin of soup at Birch's, wound
him up for the day. His attire was as formal as his
manners, being a slight modification of the prevalent
costume of some fie-and-thirty years ago. He had con-
seated, not without extreme reluctance, to clothe his nether
limbs in the unmentionable garment of recent introduction;
but he resolutely adhered to the pigtail. There is some-
thing, by-the-by, in a pigtail, to which old gentlemen cling
in spite of all remonstrate, with lover-like pertinacity.
Only hint the propriety of cutting it off to your great-uncle
or your grandfather, and you may rely on being cut off with
s shilling yourself. Be this as it may, Sir Lionel gathered
his locks, once sable as the riband that bound them, but
now thickly strewn with the silver  blossoms of the grave,'
into a knot, and suffered them to angle a few inches below
his collar. His shoes shone with a lustre beyond French
polish, and his hat was brushed till not a wind dared to ap-
roach it. Sir Lionel wore a white, unstarched cravat, with
a thick pad in it, sported a frill over his waistcoat, carried
a black ebony cane in his hand, and was generally followed
by s pet pg-dog, one of the most spacious and disagree-
able specimens of his species. Sir Lionel Flamstead, I have
said, was all-I might have said he was very tall-some-

what narrower across the shoulders than about the hips-a
circumstance which did not materially conduces to his
symmetry-with grey, benevolent eyes, shaded by bnshy,
intelligent brows-a lofty, expansive forehead, in which,
in the jargon of phrenology, the organs of locality and
ideality were strongly developed, and which was rendered
the more remarkable from the flesh having fallen in on
either side of the temples-with a nose which had been
considered handsome and well proportioned in his youth,
but to which good living had imparted a bottle form and a
bottle tint-and cheeks from which all encroachment of
whiskers was sedulonsly removed, in order, we conclude,
that his rosy complexion might be traced from its point of
concentration, upon the prominent feature before mentioned,
to its final disappearance behind his ears. Such was Sir
Lionel Flamstead.

ness all the pomp and splendour displayed at this high
eolemnity-to gaze down that glittering pile, and mark the
various ecclesiastical dignitaries, eneh in their peculiar and]
characteristic costume, employed in the administration of their
sacred functions, and surrounded by a wide semicircle of the
papal guards, so stationed to keep back the crowd, and
who, with their showy scarlet attire and tall halberds,
looked like the martial figures we see in the sketches of
Cnllot. Nor was the brilliant effect of this picture dim-
wished by the sumptuous framework in which it was set.
Overhead blamed a roof resplendent with burnished gold;
before me rose a canopy supported by pillars of porphyry,
and shining with many-coloured stones; while on either
hand were chapels devoted to some noble house, and boast-
in each the marble memorial of a pope. Melodious masses
proper to the service were ever and anon chanted by the
papal choir, and overpowering perfume was diffused around
by a hundred censers.
Subdued by the odours, the music, and the spectacle, I
sank into a state of dreamy enthusiasm, during a continue-
ance of which I almost fancied myself a convert to the faith
of Rome, and surrendered myself nnreflectingly to an ad-
migration of its errors. As lI gazed among the surrounding
crowd, the sight of so many prostrate figures, all in atti-
tudes of deepest devotion, satisfied me of the profound
religious impression of the ceremonial. As elsewhere, this
feeling was not universal; and, as elsewhere, likewise, more

zeal was exhibited by the lower than the higher classes of
society; and I occasionally noted amongst the latter the
glitter of an eye or the flutter of a bosom, not altogether
agitated, I suspect, by holy aspirations. Yet methought,
on the whole, I had never seen such abandonment of soil,
such prostration of spirit, in my own colder crime, and
during the exercise of my own more chastened creed, as
that which in several instances I now beheld; and I almost
envied the poor maiden near me, who, abject upon the
earth, had washed away her sorrows, and perhaps her sins,
in contrite tears.
As such thoughts swept through my mind, I felt a plea-
sure in singling ont particular figures and groups which in-
interest me, from their peculiarity of costume, or from
their devotional feronr. Amongst others, a little to my
left, I remarked a band of mountaineers from Calabria, for
such I judged them to be from their wild and picturesque
garb. Deeply wass every individual of this little knot of
peasantry impressed by the ceremonial. Every eye was

humbly cast don; every knee bent; every hand was
either occupied in grasping the little crucifix suspended
from its owner's neck, in telling the beads of his rosary, or
foervently crossed upon his bare and swarthy breast
While gazing upon this group, I chanced upon an indi-
visual whom I had not hitherto noticed, and who now ire-
possibly attracted my attention. Though a little removed
from the Calabrian mountaineers, and reclining against the

marble walls of the church, he evidently belonged to the
same company; at least, so his attire seemed to indicate,
though the noble cast of his countenance was far superior
to that of his comrades. He was an old man, with a face
of the fine antique Roman stamp-a bold outline of dromi-
next nose, rugged and imperious brow, and proudly-cut
chin. His head and china, as well as his naked breast, were
frosted over with the snowy honours of many winters, and
their host appearance contrasted strikingly with the tawny
hue of a skin almost as dark and as lustronus as polished
on. Peasant as he was, there was something of grandeur
and majesty in this old man's demeanour and physiognomy.
HIs head declined backwards, to as completely to expose
his long and muscular throat. His arms hung listlessly by
his side; one hand drooped upon the pavement, to other
was placed within his breast: his eyes were closed. The
old man's garb was of the coarsest fabric; he wore little
beyond a skirt, a loose vest, a sort of sheep-skin cloak, and
canvas leggings bound around with leather thongs. His
appearance, however, was taboo his condition; he became
his rags as proudly as a prince would have become his
ermined robe.
The more I serutinised the rigid lines of this old man's
countenance, the more I became satisfied that many sin-
gulag, and perhaps not wholly guiltless, events were con-
needed with his history. The rosary was in his hand-tha
cross upon his breast-the beads were untold-the orifice

nnelasped-no breath of prayer passed his lips. His face
was turned eavenward, but his eyes were closed,-he
dared not open them. Why did he come thither, if he did
not venture to pray Why did he assume a penitential
attitude, if he felt no penitence
So absorbed was I in the perusal of the workings of this
old man's countenanee, as to be scarcely conscious that the
service of high mass was concluded, and the crowd within
the holy pilot fast dispersing. The music was hushed, tha
robed prelates and their train had disappeared, joyous dames
were hastening along the marble aisles to their eqnipages;
all, have a few kneeling figures near the chapels, were de-
parting; and the old man, aware, from the star and hum
prevailing around, that the ceremonial was at an end, arose,
stretched on his arm to one of his comrades, a youth who
had joined him, and prepared to follow the concourse.
Was he really blind? Assuredly not. Besides, he did
not walk like as one habituated to the direst calamity that
can befal on nature. He staggered in his gait, and reeled
to and fro. Yet wherefore did he not venture to enclose his
eyes within the temple of the Most High7 What would I

I might satisfy my curiosity at once. He was moving
slowly forward, guided by his comrade. In a few seconds
it would be too late-he would have vanished from my
sight. With hasty footsteps I followed him down the]

church, and laid my hand, with some violence, upon his
shoulder.
The old man started at the touch, and turned. Now,
indeed, his eyes were opened wide, and flashing full upon
me,-and such eyes Heretofore I had only dreamed of
such. Age had not quenched their lightning, and I quailed
beneath the fierce glances which he threw upon me. But if
I was, at first, surprised at the display of anger which I had
called forth in him, how much more was I astonished to
behold the whole expression of his countenance suddenly
change. His eyes continued fixed upon mine as if I had
been a basilisk. Apparently ho would not alert them;
while his whole frame shiered with emotion. I advanced
towards him; he shrank backwards, and, but for the timely
aid of his companion, would have fallen upon the pae-
Iment.
At a loss to conceive in what way I could have coca-
signed him so much alarm, I rushed forward to the assist-
ance of the old man, when his son, for such it subsequently
appeared he was, rarely repelled me, and thrust his hand
into his girdle, as if to seek for means to prevent further
interference.

Meanwhile the group had been increased by the arrival
of a third party, attracted by the cry the old man had
uttered in falling. The new comer was an Italian gentle-
man, somewhat stricken in years; of stern and stately de-
portment, and with something minister and forbidding in his
A NIGHT' ADVENTURE I ROE. 221
aspect. Ho was hastening towards the old man, bat ha
suddenly stopped, and was about to retire when he couldn-
tered my gaze. As our eyes met he started; and a terror,
as sudden and likely as that'exhibited by the old man, was
at once depicted in his features.
My surprise was now beyond all bonds, and I continued
for some moments speechless with astonishment. Not a
little of the inexplicable awe which affected the old man
and the stranger was communicated to myself. Alto-
gather, we formed a mysterious and terrible triangle, of
which each side bore some strange and unintelligible real-
tion to the other.
The new comer first recovered his composure, though not
without an effort. Coldly turning his heel upon me, he
walked towards the old man, and shook him forcibly. The
latter shrank from his grasp, and endeavoured to void
him; but it was impossible. The stranger whispered a few
words in his year, of which, from his gestures being directed
towards myself, I would guess the import. The old man
replied. His action in doing so was that of supplication
and despair. The stranger retorted in a wild and vehement
manner, and weren stamped upon the ground; but the old
man still continued to cling to the knees of his superior.
 Weak, superstitious fool?'' at length exclaimed the
stranger, `' I will waste no more words upon thee. Do, or
say, what thon wilt; bnt beware t1'' And spurning him
haughtily back with his foot, he stole away.

The old man's reverend head struck against the marble
floor. His temple was cut open by the fall, and blood
gushed in torrents from the wound. Recovering himself,
he started to his feet- knife was instantly in his hand,
and he would have pursued and doubtless slain his ag-
resort, if he had not been forcibly withheld by his son,
and by a priest who had joined them.

steps he quieted the church, accompanied by his son.
 Who is that old man 2'' I demanded of the priest.
I am as ignorant as yourself,'' he replied, ``but i
must be looked to; the talks threateningly'' And he
beckoned to an attendant.
e Who was he who struck him1' was my next inquiry.
 One of our wealthiest nobles,'' he replied, `` and an
assured friend of the church. We could ill spare him. Do
not lose sight of them,'' he added to the attendant, `` and
let the sbirri track them to their haunts. They must not
be suffered to go forth to-night. A few hours' restraint
will cool their hot Calabrian blood.''

my inquiries.

be all to have these stains effaced, which may else bring
scandal on these holy walls. You will excuse me, my son.''
So saying, he bowed and retired.
I made fruitless inquiries for the old man at the door of
the church. It was gone; none of the bystanders who
had seen him go forth knew whither.
Stung by curiosity, I wandered amid the most unfre-
quented quarters of Rome throughout the day, in the hope
of meeting with the old Calabrian, but in vain. As, how-
her, I entered the court-yard of my hotel, I fancied I dis-

covered, amongst the lounging assemblage gathered round
the door, the dark eyes of the younger mountaineer. In
this I might have been mistaken. No one answering to his
description had been seen near the house.

Of the same night I bent my steps towards the Color-
sum; and, full of my adventure of the morning, found
myself, not without apprehension, involved within its lab-
printing passages. Accompanied by a monk, who, with a
small horn lantern in his hand, acted as my guide, I fancied
that, by its uncertain light, I could discover stealthy figures
lurking within the shades of the ruin.
Whatever suspicions I might entertain, I pursued my
course in silence. Emerging from the vittorio, we stood
upon the steps of the colossal amphitheatre. The huge pilot
was bathed in rosy moonlight, and reared itself in serene
majesty before my view.
While indulging in a thousand speculations, occasioned
by the hour and the spot, I suddenly perceived a figure on
a point of the ruin immediately above me. Nothing but
the head was visible; but that was placed in bold relief
-
226  A NIGHT' ADVEYTOE IN OE.
against the beaming sky of night, and I recognised it at
once. No nobler Roman head had eer graced the circus
when Rome was in her zenith. I shouted to the old Cala-
brian, for he it was I beheld. Almost are the sound had
left my lips, he had disappeared. I made known what I
had seen to the monk. He was alarmed-urged our in-
stant departure, and advised me to seek the assistance of
the sentinel stationed at the entrance to the pile. To this
proposal I assented; and, having descended tho vast steps
and forced the open arena, we arrived, without molesta
tion, at the doorway.
The sentinel had allowed no one to pass him. He re-
turned with me to the circus; and, after an ineffectual
search amongst the ruins, volunteered his services to a-
company me homewards throug the Forum. I declined
his offer, and shaped my course towards a lonesome vicolo
on the right. This was courting danger; but lI cared nt,
and walked lowly forward through the deserted place.
Scarcely had I proceeded many paces, when I heard
footsteps swiftly approaching; and, here I could tun round,
my arms were seized from behind, and a bandage was
passed across my eyes. All my efforts at liberation were
unarsiling; and, after a brief struggle, I remained passive.
MAke no noise,'' said a oiee which I knew to be that
of the old man, ``and no harm shall befal you. Yon must
come with us. Ask no questions, but follow.''
I suffered myself to be led, without further opposition,

A MIGHT's CAYENNe IN ROE. 227
whithersoever they listed. We walked for it might be half
an hour, much beyond the walls of Rome. I had to scramble
through many ruins, and frequently stumbled over in-
equalitics of ground. I now felt the fresh breeze of night
blowing over the wide campagna, and my conductors moved
swiftly onwards as we trod on its elastic turf.
At length they came to a halt. My bandage was re-
moved, and I beheld myself beneath the arch of an aqueduct,
which spanned the moonlit plain. A fire was kindled be-
neath the arch, and the ruddy flame licked its walls.
Around the blaze were groped the little band of peasantry
I had beheld within the church, in various and picturesque
attitudes. They greeted my conductors on their arrival, and
glanced inquisitisely at me, but did not speak to me. The
older Calabrian, whom they addressed as Cristiano, asked
for a glass of aqua vir, which he handed respectfully to
mc. I declined the offer, but he pressel it upon me.
 You will need it, signor,'' he said; `` on hae much to
go to-night. You fear, perhaps, it is dragged. Behold1'
And he drink it off.
I could not, after this, refuse his pledge.  And now,
signor,'' said the old man, removing to a little distance
from the group, ``'may I crave a word with on-your
name '"
As I had no reason for withholding it, I tcl him how I
was called.
 Eum1 Hal you no relation of the name of---1

228 A MIGhT's ADEMTFUBE IN ROE.
None whatever.'' And I sighed, for I thought of my
desolate condition.
Stranger'' he muttered; adding, with a grim smile,
 but, however, likenesses are easily accounted for,''
 hat likenesses 2'' I asked. ee Whom do I resemble 7
and what is the movie of your inexplicable conduct 2
e You shall hear,'' he replied, frowning gloomily. Step
inside, and let us get within the shade of these arches, out
of the reach of yonder listeners. The tale I have to tell is
for your ears alone.''
I obeyed him; and we stood beneath the shadow of the
aqueduct.
 Years ago,'' began the old in, ` an Englishman, in
all respects resembling yourself, equally well-favoured in
person, and equally young, came to Rome, and took up his
abode within the eternal city. He was of high rank in his
own country, and was treated with the distinction due to
his exalted station here. At that time I dwelt with the
MArchese di-. I was his confidential servant-his ad-
viper-his friend. Had lived with his father-carried him
as an infant-sported with him as a boy-lord and served
in as a man. Loved him, I say; for, despite his treat-
ment of me, I loved him then as much as I abhor him now.
Welll signor, to my story. If his youth had been polish-
gate, his manhood was not less depraed; it was devoted
to hold, calculating libertinism. Soon after he succeeded
to the estates and title of his father, hoe married. That he


A MaRs ADVENTURE IN ROE. 229
loved his bride, I can scarcely believe; for, though he was
wildly jealous of her, he was himself unfaithful, and she
knew it. In Italy, revenge, in such cases, is easily within
a woman's power; and, for angst I know, the marchesa
might have meditated retaliation. My lord, however, took
the alarm, and thought it to retire to his villa without the
city, and for a time remained secluded within its walls. It was
at this crisis that the Englishman I have before mentioned
arrived in Rome. My lady, who mingled little with the
gaietios of the city, had not beheld him; but she would not
have been unacquainted with him by report, as every tongue
was loud in his praises. A rumour of his successes with
other dames had reached my lord; nay, I have reason to
believe that he had been thwarted by the handsome Eng-
lishman in some other quarter, and he sedulously pre-
vented their meeting. An interview, however, did take
place between them, and in an unexpected manner. It was
the custom then, as now, upon particular occasions, to
drive, during the heat of summer, within the Piazza
Navona, which is flooded with water. One evening the
marchesa drop thither: she was unattended, except by
myself. Our carriage happened to be stationed near that
of the young Englishman,''
 The marchesa was beautiful, no doubt '' I said, inter-
rating him.
 MOst beautiful'' he replied; `' and so your country-
man seemed to think, for he was lost in admiration of her.
230  A NIGIIT's ADVENTURE IN OIE.
I am not much versed in the language of the eyes, but his
were too eloquent and expressive not to be understood. I
watched my mistress narrowly. It was evident from her
glowing cheek, though her eyes were cast down, that she
was not insensible to his regards. She turned to play
with her dog, a lovely little greyhound, which was in the
carriage beside her, and patel it carelessly with the glove
which she held in her hand. The animal snatched the
glove from her grasp, and, as he bounded backwards, fell
over the carriage side. MIy lady uttered a scream at the
sight, and I was preparing to extricate the struggling dog,
when the Englishman plunged into the water. In an instant
he had restored her favourite to the marchesa, and received
her warmest acknowledgments. From that moment an in-
impact commenced, which was destined to produce the most
fatal consequences to both parties.''
Did yon betray them 1'' I asked, somewhat impatiently.
e I was then the blind tool of the marchese. I did so,''
replied the old man. I told him all particulars of the
interview. Ile heard me in silence, bnt grew ashy palo
with suppressed rage. Bidding me redouble my vigilante,
he left me. MIy lady was now scarcely ever out of my
sight; when one evening, a few days after what had oc-
curved, she walked forth alone upon the garden-terrace of
the villa. Her guitar was in her hand, and her favourite
dog by her side. I was at a little distance, but wholly nn-
perceived. She struck a few plaintive chords upon her

A NIGIII's ADVENTURE IN ROB. 231
instrument, and then, resting her chin upon her white and
rounded arm, seemed lost in tender eerie. Would you
had seen her, signor, as I beheld her then, or as one other
botched her you would acknowledge that you had never
met with her equal in beauty. Her raven hair fell in thick
tresses oer shoulders of dazzling whiteness and the most
perfect proportion. Her deep dark eyes were thrown lan-
widely on the ground, and her radiant features were charged
with an expression of profound and penske passion.
 In this musing attitude she continued for some minutes,
when she was aroused by the gamble of her dog, who bore
in his mouth a glove which he had found. As she took it
from him, a letter dropped upon the floor. Had a serpent
glided from its folds, it could not have started her more.
She gazed upon the paper, offended, but irresolute. Yes,
she was irresolute; and you may conjecture the rest. Sho
paused, and by that pause was lost. With a shrinking
grasp she stooped to raise the letter. Her cheeks, which
had grown deathly pale, again kindled with brushes as she
perused it. She hesitated-cast a bewildering look towards
the mansion-placed the note within her bosom-and
plunged into the orange-bower.''

man's and was at my throat, and his sword at my breast,
with the swiftness of thought; and but for the screams of
my mistress, that instant must have been my last. At her
desiro he relinquished his hold of me; but her cries had
reached other ears, and the marchese married to avenge his
injured honour. He paused not to inquire the nature of
the fence, bat, sword in hand, assailed the Englishman,
bidding me remove his Lady. The clash of their steel was
drowned by er shrieks as I bore her away; but I knew
the strife was desperate. Before I gained the house my
lady had fitted; and, committing her to the charge of
other attendants, I returned to the terrace. I met my
master slowly walking homewards. His sword was gone-
his brow was bent-he shunned my sight. I knew what
had happened, and did not approach him. He sought his
wife. What passed in that interview was never disclosed,
but it may be guessed at from its result. That night the
marchesa left her husband's halls-never to return. Next
morn I visited the terrace where she had received the
token. The globe was still upon the ground. I picked it
up and carried it to the marchese, detailing the whole
occurrence to him. He took it, and vowed as he took it
that his vengeance should never rest satisfied till that globe
had been steeped in her blood.''
And he kept his vow 1'' I asked, shnddering.

to blind his ultimate designs. Meanwhile, time rolled on,
and the marchesa gave birth to a child-the offspring of

One night, during the absence of the Englishman, by secret
means we entered the palazzo where the marchesa resided.
We wandered from room to room till we came to her
chamber. She was sleeping, with her infant by her side.
The sight maddened the marchese. He would have stricken
the child, but I held back his hand. He relented. IIe
bade me make fast the door. H approached the bol. I
heard a hustle-a scream. A white figure sprang from out
the couch. In an instant the light was extinguished-
there was a blow-another-and all was oer. I the

which we stood was flooded with moonlight. A glove was
in his hand-it was dripping with blood. His oath wss
fulfilled-his vengeance complete-no, not complete, for
the Englishman yet lived,''
 What became of him 7'' I inquired.
t Ask me not,'' replied the old man; `' you were at th
Chiesas Santa Maria Maggiore this morning. If those
stones would speak, they might tell a fearful story.''
 And that was the reason you did not dare to enclose

floated between on and heaven.''
The old man shuttered, but replied not.
And the child?'" I asked, after a pause;`" what of

It was conveyed to England by a friend of its dead
father. If he were alive, that boy would be about your
age, signor.''
Indeed I'' I said; a horrible suspicion flashing across
my mind.
After the Englishman's death,'' continued Cristiano,
` my master began to treat me with a coldness and sus-
picion which increased daily. I was a burden to him, and
he was resolved to rid himself of me. I spared him the

bria, and become-no matter what. Ira I am, Heaven'a

 Your own life will be the penalty of your obstinacy, if

who or what you are; but to me you are an instrument of
vengeance, and as such I shall use you. Tha blow dealt
by you will see the work of retribution; and I care not
if you strike twice, and make my heart your second mark.''
Ere I coll reply he called to his comrades, and in a few
moments we were speeding across the campagna.
Wo arrived at a high wall : the old man conducted us to
a postern-gate, which he opened. We entered s garden
filled with orange-trees, the perfume of which loaded the
midnight air. We heard the splash of a fountain at a dis-
dance, and the thrilling notes of a nightingale amongst
some taller trees. The moon hung like a lamp over the
belvidere of the proud villa. We strode along a wide ter-
re edged by a marble balustrade. The old man pointed
to an open summer-house terminating the walk, and gave
me a significant look, but he spoke not. A window thrown

open admitted as to the house. We were within a haIl
crowded with statues, and traversed noiselessly its marble
floors. Passing through several chambers, we then mounted
to a corridor, and entered an apartment which formed the
ante-room to another beyond it, Placing his finger upon
his lips, and making a sign to his comrades, Cristofana
opened a door and disappeared. There was a breathless
pause for a few minutes, during which I listened intently,
but caught only a faint sound as of the snapping of a look.
Presently the old man returned.
 Ie sleeps,'' he said, in a low deep tone to me; ' sleeps
as his victim slept-sleeps without a dream of remorse;
and he shall awaken, as she awoke, to despair. Come into
his chamber t
Woe obeyed. The door was made fast within side.
The curtains of the couch were withdrawn, and the
moonlight streamed full upon the face of the sleeper. He
was rushed in profound reposo. No visions seemed to haunt
his peaceful slumbers. Could guilt sleep so soundly1 I
half donated the old man's story.
Placing us within the shadow of the canopy, Cristiano
approached the bed. A stiletto littered in his hand.
 Awake l'' he cried, in a voice of thunder.
The sleeper started at the summons.
I watched his countenance. He read Cristofori's errand
in his eye. But he quailed not.


A NIGHT's ADvENTURES IN ROB. 237
e Cowardly assassin 1'' he cried, `' you have well consulted
your own safety in stealing on my sleep.'
And who taught me the lesson 1'' fiercely interrupted
the old msn. Am I the first that have stolen on mid-
night slumber7 Gaze upon this7 When and how did it
acquire its dye ?'' And he held forth a glove, which looked
blackened and stained in the moonlight.
The marchese groaned aloud.
 My cabinet broken open'' at length he exclaimed-
et million how dared you do this But why do I rare7 I
know with whom I have to deal,'' Uttering these words he
sprung from his coach with the intention of grappling with
the old man; but Cristiano retreated, and at that instant
the brigands, who rushed to his aid, thrust me forward. I
was face to face with the marchese.
The apparition of the murdered man could not have
staggered him more. His limbs were stiffened by the
shock, and he remained in an attitude of freezing terror.
eIs he come for vengeance 7'' he ejaculated.
 He is' cried Cristiano. Give him the weapon.'
And a stiletto was thrust into my hand. Bat I heeded not
the steel. I tore open my bosom-a small diamond cross
was within the folds.
