my landlord-the solitary neighbour that I

so completely removed from the star of society.

When he saw my horse's breast fairly push-

Wuthering Heights is the name of Mr.
Heathcliff'a dwelling. : Wuthering'' being a
significant provincial adjective, descriptive of
the atmospheric tumult to which its station is
exposed, in stormy weather. Pure, bracing
ventilation they must have up there, at all
times, indeed: one may guess the power of the
north wind, blowing over the edge, by the
excessive slant of a few, stunted fire at the
end of the house; and by a range of gaunt
thorns all stretching their limbs one way, as
if craving alms of the sun. Happily, the ar-
architect had foresight to build it strong: the
narrow windows are deeply set in the wall;
and the corners defended with large jutting
stones.
Before passing the threshold, I paused to
admire a quantity of grotesque carving lavished
over the front, and especially about the prince-
pal door, above which, along a wilderness of

One step brought us into the family sitting-

laden with pancakes, and clusters of legs of
beef, mutton and ham concealed it. Above
the chimney were sundry villanous old gun,

ornament, three gaudily painted canisters dis-
posed along its ledge. he floor was of
smooth, white stone: the chairs, high-backed,

two heavy black ones lurking in the shade.
In an arch, under the dresser, reposed a huge,

introduced, what he supposed would be a sub-

I found him very intelligent on the topics we

YEstERDAY afternoon set in misty and cold. I
had half a mind to spend it by my study
fire, instead of wading through heath and mud
to Wuthering Heights.
On coming up from dinner, however, (N. B.

heaps of cinders. This spectacle drove me
back immediately; I took my hat, and, after a
four miles walk, arrived at Ileatheliff's garden
gate just in time to escape the first feathery
flakes of a snow shover.
On that bleak hill to the earth was hard

through every limb. Being unable to remove
the chain, I jumped over, and, running up the
flagged causeway bordered with straggling
gooseberry bushes, knocked mainly for admit-

howled.

hailed me to follow him, and, after marching

immense fire, compounded of coal, peat, and

and apparently scarcely past girlhood: an ad-

that I have ever had the pleasure of behold-

or rather golden, hanging loose on her delicate
neck; and eyes-had they been agreeable in
expression, they would have been irresistible-
fortunately for my susceptible heart, the only
sentiment they evinced hovered between scorn
and a kind of desperation, singularly unnatural
to be detected there.
The canisters were almost out of her reach;
I made a motion to aid her; she turned upon
me as a miser might turn, if any one at-
tempted to assist him in counting his gold

She flung the tea back, spoon and all; and
resumed her chair in a, pet, her forehead cor-
created, and her red under-lip pushed out,
like a child's, ready to cry.
Meanwhile, the young man had slung onto
his person a decidedly shabby upper garment,
and, erecting himself before the blaze, looked
down on me, from the corner of his eyes, for
all the world as if there were some mortal
feud unchanged between us. I began to doubt

I thought, if I had caused the cloud, it was

This was worse than before: the youth grew

smothered the storm in a brutal curse, muttered
on my behalf, which, however, I took care not

his habitual moroseness.

The whole furniture consisted of a chair, a

shares cut out near the top, resembling coach

HAving approached this structure, I looked
inside, and perceived it to be a singular sort
of old-fashioned couch, very conveniently de
signed to obviate the necessity for every em-
ber of the family having a room to himself.
In fact, it formed a little closet, and the edge
of a window, which it enclosed, served as a
table.
I laid back the panelled sides, got in with
my light, pulled then together again, and felt
secure against the vigilance of Heathcliff, and
every one else.
The ledge, where I placed my cradle, had a
few mildred books piled up in one corner
and it was covered with writing scratched on
the paint. This writing, however, was nothing
but a name repeated in all kinds of characters,

In vapid listlessness I leant my head against

minutes when a glare of white letters started
from the dark, as vivid as spectres-the air
swarmed with Cntherines; and rousing myself
to dispel the abusive name, I discovered my
candle wick reclining on one of the antique
volumes, and performing the place with an
odour of posted calf-skin.
I snuffed it off, and, very ill at ease, under
the influence of cold and lingering nausea, sat
up, and spread open the injured tome on my
knee. It was a Testament, in lean type, and
smelling dreadfully musty: a fly-leaf bore the
inscription- Catherine Earnsaw, her book,''
and a date some quarter of a century back.

I shut it, and took up another, and another,
till I had examined all. Catherine's library
was select; and its state of lilapidation proved
it to have been well used, though not altogether
for a legitimate purpose; scarcely one chapter
had escaped a pen and ink commentary, at
least, the appearance of one, covering every
morsel of blank that the printer had left.
Some were detached sentences; other party
took the form of a regular diary, scrawled in
an unforced, childish hand. At the top of an
extra page, quite a treasure probably when

an excellent caricature of my friend Joseph,

An immediate interest kindled within me for
the unknown Catherine, and I began, forth-

with Joseph for a guide. The snow lay yards
deep in our road; and, as we floundered on,
my companion wearied me with constant re-
preaches that I had not brought a pilgrim'e

house without one, and boastfully flourishing
a heavy-headed cudgel, which I understood to
be so denominated.

For a moment I considered it absurd that I
should need such a weapon to gain admittance
into my own residence. Then, a new idea
flashed across me. I was not going there; we
were journeying to hear the famous James
Branderham preach from the text-'` Seventy

or I had committed the '` First of the Seventy

WE came to the chapel-I have passed it

a hollow, between two hills-an elevated hol-
low-near a swamp, whose petty moisture is
said to answer all the purposes of embalming on
the few corpses deposited there. The roof has
been set wholehitherto, but, as the clergyman's
stipend is only twenty pounds per annum, and

round me in a body, and I, having no weapon
to raise in self-defence, commenced grappling
with Joseph, y nearest and most ferocious as-

We crowded round, and, over Miss Cathy's
head, I had a peep at a dirty, rugged, black-
haired child; big enough both to walk and
talk-indeed, its face looked older than Cathy-

stared round, and repeated over and over again,
some gibberish that nobody could understand.
I was frightened, and MIrs. Earnshaw was
ready to fling it out of doors: she did fly up-
asking how he could fashion to bring that gip
sy brat into the uso, when they had their
own cairns to feed, and fend for what he
meant to do with it, and whether he were

The master tried to explain the matter; but,
he was really half dead with fatigue, and all
that I could make out, amongst her scold-

houseless, and as good as dumb in the streets
of Liverpool where he picked it up and in-

to take it home with him, at once, than run,
into vain expenses there; because he was de-

Well, the conclusion was that my distress
grumbled herself calm; and MIr Bradshaw told'
me to wash it, and give it clean things, and let
it sleep with the children.
Hindley and Cathy contented themselves
with looking and listening till peace was res-
stored: then, both began searching their father's
pockets for the presents he had promised them.
The former was a boy of fourteen, but when
he drew out, what had been a fiddle crushed
to morsels in the great coat, he blundered
aloud, and Cathy, when she learnt the master

were made as to how it got there; I was obi-

saw him wronged.
He seemed a sullen, patient child; hardened,
perhaps, to ill-treatment: he would stand
Hindley's blows without winking or shedding
a year, and my pitches moved him only to
draw in a breath, and open his eyes as if he
had hurt himself by accident, and nobody was
to blame
This endurance made old Earnshaw furious
when he discovered his son persecuting the
poor, faterless child, as he called him. IIe

I symputhised awhile, but, when the evil-

dangerously sick, and while he lay at the

seeming to have got into his head the notion
that, because he liked Heathcliff, all hated, and
longed to do him an ill-turn.
It was a disadvantage to the law, for the
kinder among us did not wish to frat the mas-
ter, so we rumoured his partiality; and that
mourning was rich nourishment to the child's
pride and black tempers. Still it became in a
manner necessary; twice, or thrice, Hindley'a

little Lintons and Earanshaws, and warning his
bit of land himself,) he advise that the young

I hoped heartily we should have peace now.

in, and plaguing everybody who would not do
the same. A wild, wick slip she was-but,
she had the funniest eye, and sweetest smile,
and lightest foot in the parish; and, after all,
I believe she meant no harm; for when once
she made you cry in good earnest, it seldom
happened that she would not keep you com-

She was much too fond of Ieatheli. The

greatest punishment we could invent for her
was to keep her separate from him: yet, she
got chided more than any of us on his account.
In play, she liked, exceedingly, to at the
little mistress; using her hands freely, and com-
landing her companions: she did so to me,
but I would not bear slapping, and ordering:
and so I lot her know.
Now, Mr. Earnshaw did not understand
jokes from his children: he has always been
strict and grave with them; and Catherine, on
her part, had no idea why her father should be
crosser and less patient in his ailing condition,
than he was in his prime.
His peevish reproofs weakened in her a
naughty delight to provoke him; ehce was never
so happy as when we were all ecolding her at
once, and she defying us with her bold, saucy
look, and her ready world; turning Joseph'e
religious curses into ridicule, baiting me, and
doing just what her father hated most, showing
how her pretended insolence, which he thought

in anything, and his only when it suited his
own inclination.
After behaving as badly as possible all day,
she sometimes came fondling to make it up at

rue that we ever reared wheel''
That made her cry, at first; and then, being
repulsed continually hardened her, and she
laughed if I told her to say she was sorry for
her faults, and beg to be forgiven.
But the hour came, at last, that ended Mr.
Earnshaw's troubles on earth. He died
quietly in his chair one October evening, seated
by the fire-side.
A high wind bolstered round the house, and

knee, and Heathcliff was lying on the floor
with his head in her lap.

rarely to see her gentle-and saying-

not need me to coneale them. The little souls
were comforting each other with better

OF the morning of a fine June day, my first
bonny little nursing, and the last of the anti-
ent Enrnshaw stock was born.
WE were busy with the way in a far away

breakfasts came running, an hour too soon,
across the meadow and up the lane, calling me

nothing to keep her, and she'll be dead before

again to describe it rapturously. I, as zealous
as herself, hurried eagerly home to admire, on
my part, though I was very sad for Hindley'
sake; he had room in his heart only for two
idols-his wife and himself-he dated on
both, and adored one, and I couldn't conceic
how he would bear the loss.

I asked, how was the baby 2'

The servants could not bear his tyrannical
and evil conduct long: Joseph and I were the
only two that would stay. I had not the

know, I had been his foster sister, and excused
his behaviour more readily than a strange

Joseph remained to hector over tenants and
labourers; and because it was his vocation to

The master'a bad ways and bad companions

I could not half tell what an infernal house
we had. The curate dropped calling, and no-
body decent came near us, at last; unless,
Edgar Linton's vi-its to Miss Cathy might
be an exception. At fifteen she was the
queen of the country-side; she had no peer:
and she did turn out a haughty, headstrong
creature I own I did not like her, after her
infancy was past; and I vexed her frequently
y trying to bring down her arrogance; she
never took an aversion to me though. She
had a wondrous constance to old attachments;
even Heathcliff kept his hold on her infections
unalterahly, and young Linton, with all his
superiority, found it difficult to make an
equally deep impression.
He was my late master; that is his portrait
over the fireplace. It used to hang on one
side, and his wife's on the other; but he's has

test, she imposed unwittingly on the old lady
and gentleman, by her ingenious cordiality;
gained the admiration of Isabella, and the
heart and soul of her brother-acquisitions
that flattered her from the first, for she was
full of ambition-and led her to adopt a double
character without exactly intending to deceive
anyone.
In the place where she heard Heathcliff
termed a `` vulgar young ruffian,'' and ` worse
than a brute,'' she took care not to act like
him; but at home she had small inclination to
practise politeness that could only be laughed
nt, and restrain an unruly nature when it
would bring her neither credit, nor praise.

Wuthering Heights openly. IIe had a terror

pious, kept out of the way. I rather think lis
appearance there was distasteful to Catherine;
she was not artful, never played the coquette,
and had evidently an objection to her two
friends meeting at all: for when Heathcliff
expressed contempt of' Linton, in his presence,
she could not half coincide, as she did in his
absence; and when Linton evinced disgust,
and antipathy to Hlentheliff, she dare not treat
his sentiments with indifference, as if deep-
citation of her playmate were of scarcely any
consequence to her.

In the first place, he had, by that time, lost
the benefit of his early education: continual
hard work, begun soon and concluded late, had
extinguished any curiosity he once possessed

books, or learning. His childhood's sense of
superiority, instilled into him by the favours
of old MIr. Earnshaw, was faded away. He
struggled long to keep up an equality with
Catherine in her studies and yielded with
poignant though silent regret: but, he yielded
completely; and there was no prevailing on
him to take a step in the way of moving

appearance sympathised with mental destroy-

noble look; his naturally reserved disposition
was exaggerated into an almost idiotic excess
of unsociablo coarseness; and he took a grim
pleasure, apparently, in exciting the aversion
rather than the esteem of his few acquainted-
ance.
Catherine and he were constant companions
still, at bis seasons of respite from labour; but,
he had ceased to express his fondness for her
in words, and recoiled with angry suspicion
from her girlish caresses, as if conscious there
would be no gratification in lavishing such
marks of affection on him. On the before-
named occasion he came into the house to
announce his intention of doing nothing, while
I was assisting Miss Cathy to arrange her

Doubtless Catherine marked the difference

other went out. The contrast resembled what

 Thats good news. I got Miss Cache-

infinitely better than I dare to expect. She
seemed almost over fond of Mr. Linton; and

They sat together in a window whose lattice

Now fully revealed by the fire and candle-

the transformation of Heathcliff. He had

MIr. Linton, on his part, spent his time in
the library, and did not inquire concerning his

hour's interviews, during which he tried to elicit
from her some sentiment of proper horror for
Heathcliff's advances; but he could make

I kept it to myself, and brought her some tea

For two months the fugitives remained absent,

denominated n brain fever. No mother could
have nursed an only child more devotedly than
Edgar tended her. Day and night, he was
watching, and patiently enduring all the an-
annoyance that irritable nerves and a shaken
reason could inflict: and, though Kenneth re-
marked that what he saved from the grave

would only recompense his ears by forming
the source of constant future anxiety, in fact,
that his health and strength were being macri-
fixed to preserve a more ruin of humanity, he
knew no limits in gratitude and boy, when
Catherine's life was declared one of danger;
and hour after hour, he would sit beside her,
tracing the gradual return to bodily health,
and flattering his too sanguine hopes with the
illusion that her mind would settle back to its
right balance also, and she would soon be en-

The first time she left her chamber, was at

eye, long stranger to any gleam of pleasure,
caught them in waking, and shone delighted as
she gathered them eagerly together.

WVo knew she was really better, and there-
fore, decided that long confinement to a single
place produced much of this despondency, and
it might be partially removed by a change of
one.
The master told me to light a fire in the
many-week's deserted parlour, and to set an
easy-chair in the sunshine by the window;
and then he brought her down, and she sat a
long while enjoying the genial heat, and, as
we expected, revived by the objects round her,
which, though familiar, were free from the
leary associations investing her hated sick-
chamber. By evening, she seemed greatly ex-
haunted; yet no arguments could persuade her
to return to that apartment, and I had to a-
range the parlour sofa for her bed, till another
room could be prepared.
To obviate the fatigue of mounting and de-
spending the stairs, we fitted up this, where
you lie at present; on the same floor with the
parlour: and she was soon strong enough to

Ah, I thought myself, she might recover,
Bo waited on as she was. And there was dou-
ble cause to desire it, for on her existence de-
ended that of another; we cherished the hope
that in a little while, MIr. Linton's heart would
be saddened, and his lands secured from a
stranger's gripe, by the birth of an heir.
I should mention that Isabella sent to her
brother, same six weeks from her departure a
short note, announcing her marriage with
Heathcliff. It appeared dry and cold; but at
the bottom, was dotted in with mcneil, an ob-
sure apology, and an entreaty for kind reem-
branes, and reconciliation, if her proceeding
had offended him; asserting that she could not
help it then, and being done, she bad now no
power to repeal it.
Linton did not reply to this, I believe; and,
in a fortnight more, I got a long letter which
I considered odd coming iron the pen of a

CHAPTER XIV.
As soon as I had perused this epistle, I went to
the master, and informed him that his sister
had arrived at the Heights, and sent me a
a letter expressing her sorrow for Mrs. Linton'a
situation, and her ardent desire to see him;
with a wish that he would transmit to her, as
early as possible, some token of forgiveness by
me.
 Forgiveness ' said Linton.  I have
nothing to forgive her, Ellen-you may call at
Wuthering Heights this afternoon, if unlike,

and say that lIL am not angry, but In sorry to
have lost her: especially as i can never think
she'll be happy. It is out of the question my
going to see her, however; we are eternally
divided; and should she really wish to oblige
me, let ber persuade the villain she has a-
red to leave the country.''
And you wont write her a little note,
sir2'' I asked, imploring.
 No,'' ho answered.  It is needless. May
communication with Heathcliff'a family shall
be as sparing as his with mine. It shall not
exist 
MIr. EDgar's coldness depressed me exceed-
tingly; and all the way from the Grange, I
puzzled my brains how to put more heart into
what he said, when I repeated it; and how to
soften his refusal of even a few lines to con-
sole Isabella.
I dare say she has been on that watch for
me since morning: lI saw hcr looking through
the lattice, as I cate u the garden causeway

and I nodded to her; but she drew back, as if
afraid of being observed.
I entered without knocking. There neves
was such a dreary, dismal scene as the formerly
cheerful house presented1 I must confess
that, if I had been in the young lady place,
I would, at least, have swept the hearth, and
wiped the tables with a duster. But she al-
ready partook of the pervading spirit of neglect
which encompassed her. Her pretty face was
an and listless; her hair unfurled; some
locks landing lankly dow, and some care-
lessly twisted round her head. Probably she
had not touched her dress since lester evening.
Hindley was not there. Mr. Heathcliff sat
at a table, turning over some papers in his
pocket-book ; but he rose when I appeared,
asked me how I did, quite friendly, and offered
me a chair.

tions, that he would certainly have struck a
stranger as a born and bred gentleman, and his
wife as a thorough little splatter
She came forward eagerly to greet me; and
held out one hand to take the expected letter.
I shook my head. She wouldn't under-
stand the hint, but followed me to a site-
board, where I went to lay my bonnet, and
importuned me in a whisper to give her di-
really what I had brought.
Heathcliff' gue-sed the meaning of her
manuvres, and said-
 If you have got anything for Isabella, as
no doubt you have, Nelly, give it to her. You
needn't make a secret of it; we have no secrets
between us,''
Oh, I have nothing,'' I replied, thinking
it best to speak the truth at once.  My
master bid e tell his sister that she must not
expect either a letter or a visit from him at
present. He sends his loe, ma'am, and his
wishes for your happiness, and his pardon for

the grief you have ocsasionodl; but he thinks
that after this time, his household, and the
household here, should drop intercommunica-
tion; as nothing good could come of keeping
it up.
Mrs. Heathcliff's lip quivered slightly, and
she returned to her seat in the window. 1ler
husband took his stand on the hearthstone,
near me, and began to put questions concern-
in Catherine.
I told him as much as I thought proper of
her illness, and he extorted from me, by cross-
examination, most of the facts connected with
its origin.
I blamed her, as she deserved, for bringing
it all on herself; and ended by hoping that he
would follow MIr. Linton's example, and avoid
future interference with his family, for good or
evil.
mIR.s Linton is now just recovering,'' I
said, ``she'll never be like she as, but her
life is spared, and if you really have a regard

ANoTHER week over- and I am so many day
nearer health, and spring I have now heard
all my neighbour's history, at different sitting
as the housekeeper could spare time from more
important occupations. I'll continue it in he

In the evening,'' she said, `' the evening
of my visit to the Heights, I knew as well as
if I saw him, that MIr. HEathcliff was about
the place; and I shunned going out, because 1
still carried his letter in my pocket, and didn't
want to be threatened, or teased any more.
I had made up my mind not to give it till
my master went somewhere; as I could not
guess how its receipt would affect Catherine.
The consequence was, that it did not reach
her before the lapse of three days. The fourth

after the family were gone to church.
There was a man servant left to keep the
house with me, and we generally made a pac-
tice of locking the doors during the hours of
service; but on that occasion, the weather was
so warm and pleasant that I set them wide
open; and to fulfil my engagement, as l knew
he would be coming, I told my companion
that the mistress wished very much for some
oranges, and he must run over to the village,

and get a few, to be paid for on the morrow.
He departed, and I went up-stairs.
Mrs. Linton sat in a loose, white dress,
with a light shawl over her shoulders, in the
recess of the open window, as usual. Hcr
thick, long hair had been partly removed at
the beginning of her illness: and now, she
wore it simply combed in its natural tresscs
over her temples and neck. Her appearance
was altered, as l had told Heathcliff, but when
she was calm, there seemed unearthly beauty
in the change.
The flash of her eyes had been succeeded by
a dreamy and melancholy softness: they no
longer have the impression of looking at the
objects around her; they appeared always to
gaze beyond, and far beyond-you would have
said out of this world-Then, the paleness of
her face, its haggard aspect having varied

the touching interest, which she weakened, and
invariably to me, I know, and to any person

as one doomed to decay.

the scarcely perceptible wind fluttered ite

Said it there, for she never endeavoured to
divert herself with reading, or occupation of
any kind; and he would spend many an hour
in trying to entice her attention to some sub-
jet which had formerly been her amusement
She was conscious of his aim, and in her
better moods, endured his efforts placidly; only
slowing their uselessness by now and then
suppressing a wearied sigh, ane cheering him
at last, with the saddest of smiles and kisses.
At other times, she would turn petulantly
away, and hide cr face in her hands, or even
push lim off angrily; and then he took care
to let her alone, for he was certain of doing
no good.

At Wuthering Heights it always sounded on

mentioned before, which expressed no recogni-

on her knee. e You must read it immedi-

Mrs. Linton bent forward, and listened
breathlessly. The minute after a step tra-

tempting for Heathcliff to resist walking in:
most likely he supposed that I was inclined to
shirk my promise, and so resolved to trust to his
own audacity.
With straining eagerness Catherine gazed
towards the entrance of her chamber. He did
not hit the right room directly; she motioned
me to admit him; but he found it out, ere 1

AoUT twelve o'clock, that night, was born
the Catherine you saw at Wuthering Heights,
a puny, seven months' child; and two hours
after the mother died, having never recovered
sufficient consciousness to miss Heathcliff, or
know Edgar.
The latter's distraction at his bereavement

after effects showed how deep the sorrow sunk.
A great addition, in my eyes, was his being

the infinite calm in which she lay. My mind
was never in a holier frame, than while I gazed
on that untroubled image of Divine rest. I in-

boundless in its duration, and love in its set-

that occasion how much selfishness there is
even in a live like Mlr. Linton's, when he so

motive was seeing Mr. Heathcliff. If he had
remained among the arches all night he would
have heard nothing of the star at the Grange,

had come nearer he would probably be aware,
from the lights fitting to and co, and the open-

I wished yet feared to find him. I felt the
terrible news must be told, and I longed to

He was there-at least a few yards further

had gathered on the budden branches, and fell

MIrs. Linton's funeral was appointed to take
place on the Friday following her release; and
till then her coffin remained uncovered, and
strewn with flowers and scented leaves, in the
great drawing-room. Linton spent his days
and nights there, a sleepless guardian; and-
a circumstance concealed from all but me-
Heathcliff spent his night, at least, outside,
equally a stranger to repose.
I held no communication with him; still I
was conscious of his design to enter, if he
could; and on the ueslay, a little after dark,
when my master from sheer fatigue, had been
compelled to retire a couple of hours, I went

 Yesterday, you know, MIr. Earnshaw should

He had ceased drinking at a point below ira-

wind which shook the windows every now and

sensitive was his version, that he refrained
from going anywhere where he was likely to
see or hear of Heathcliff. Grief, and that to-
gather, transformed him into a complete her-
mit: he threw up his office of magistrate,
ceased even to attend church, avoided the vil-
lage on all occasions, and spent a life of entire
seclusion within the limits of his park and
grounds: only varied by solitary rambled on
the moors, and visits to the grave of his wife,
mostly at evening, or early morning, before
other wanderers were abroad.
But he was too good to be thoroughly un-

It was named Catherine, but he acer called
it the name in full, as he had never called the
first Catherine short, probably because Heath-

was always Cathy, it formed to him a distine-

with her; and his attached sprang from its
relation to her, far more than from its being
his own.
I used to draw a comparison between him,
and Hindley Earnshuaw and people myself to
explain satisfactorily, why their conduct was
so opposite in similar circumstances. They

attached to their children; and I would not see

was high, though not rough, and qualified by a

My master hesitated not a moment in com-
plying with her request; reluctant as he was
to leave home at ordinary calls, he flew to an-

clear vigilance, in his absence; with reiterated
orders that she must not wander out of the
park, even under my escort; he did not calcu-

He was away three weeks: the first day or
two, my charge sat in a corner of the library,
too sad for either reading or playing: in that
quiet state she caused me little trouble; but it
was succeeded by an interval of impatient,
fretful eariness; and being too busy, and too
old then, to run up and down amusing her, I
hit on a method by which she might entertain
herself.
I used to send her on her travels round the

Luckily, y confidence proved misplaced.
Catherine came to me, one morning, at eight

I could scarcely refrain from smiling at this
antipathy to the poor fellow; who was a well-
made, athletic youth, good looking in features,
and stout and healthy, but attired in garments
befitting his daily occupations of working on
the farm, and lounging among the moors after
rabbits and game. Still, I thought I could

better qualities than his father ever possessed

not treated him physically ill; thanks to his

that course of oppression; it had none of the
timid susceptibility that would have given zest
to ill-treatment, in Heathcliff's judgment. He

which did not annoy his keeper; never led a
single step towards virtue, or guarded by a
single precept against vice. And from what I
heard, Joseph contributed much to his dote-
operation by a narrow minded partiality which
prompted him to flatter, and pet him, as a boy,
because he was the head of the old family.
And as he had been in the habit of accusing
Catherine Eurnshas, and HEathcliff, when
children, of putting the master past his pa-
tienne, and compelling him to seek solace in
drink, by what he termed, their ' old ways,'
so at present, he said the whole burden of
Iareton's faults on the shoulders of the usurper

tion; but then, he reflected that Heathcliff
must answer for it. Hareton's blood would be
required at his hands; and there lay immense
consolation in that thought.
Joseph had instilled into him a pride of
name, and of his lineage: he would had he
dared, have fostered hate between him and
the present owner of the Heights, but his
dream of that owner amounted to superstition:
and he confined his feelings, regarding him, to
muttered innuendo's and private commina-
tions.
I don't pretend to be intimately acquainted
with the mode of living customary in those
days, at Wuthering Heights. I only speak
from hearsay; for I saw little. The villagers
affirmed Mr. Heathcliff' was near, and a cruel
hard landlord to his tenants; but the house,

and he wrote to bid me get mourning for his

Catherine ran wild with joy at the idea of
welcoming her father back: and indulged
most sanguine anticipations of the numerals-

The evening of their expected arrival come.

in her new black frock-poor thing her
aunt's death impressed her with no definite

to walk with her, down through the grounds, to

rolled in sight.

sickly pcevishness in his aspect, that Elgar
Linton never had.
The latter saw me looking; and having
shaken hands, advised me to close the door,
and leave him undisturbed; for the journey
had fatigued him.
Cathy would fain have taken one glance;
but her father told her to come on, and they
walked together up the park, while I hastened
before, to prepare the servants

The carriage stopped; and the sleeper,
being roused, was lifted to the ground by his
uncle.
 This is your cousin Cathy, Linton,'' he
said, putting their little hands together.
 She's fond of you already; and mind you
don't grieve her by crying the-night. Try to be
cheerful now; te travelling is at an end, and
you have nothing to do but rest and amuse
yourself as you please.''
`` Let me go to her then,'' answered the
boy, shrinking from Catherine's salute; and
he put his fingers to his eyes to remove incipi-
ent tears.

I do not know whether it were sorrow for
him, but his cousin put on as sad a county-

All three entered, and mounted to the library
where tea was laid realy.
I proceeded to remove Linton's cap, and
mantle, and placed him on a chair by the table;
but he was no sooner seated than he began to
cry afresh. My master inquired what was the
matter.
I can't sit on a chair,'' sobbel the boy.

Linton slowly trailed himself off, and lay
down. Cathy carried a foot-stool and hcr cup
to his side.

when a maid stepped out of the kitchen, and
informed me that Mr. Heathcliff's servant,
Joseph, was at the door, and wished to speak
with the master.
I shall ask him what he wants first,'' I said,
in considerable trepidation.  A very unlikely
honor to be troubling people, and the instant
they have returned from a long journey. I don't
think the master can see him.,''
Joseph had advanced through the kitchen,
as I uttered these words, and now present-

Sunday garments, with his most sanctimonious
and sourest face; and holding his hat in one
hand, and his stick in the other, he proceeded
to olean his shoes on the mat
 Good evening, Joseph,'' I said, coldly.

surveying the range of closed doors.
I perceived he was sent on refusing my me-
dilation; so very reluctantly, I went up to the
library, and announced the unseasonable visit-
ter; advising that he should be dismissed till
next day.
MIr. Linton had no time to empower me to
do so, for he mounted close at my heels, and
pushing into the apartment, planted himself
at the far side of the table, with his two fist
clamped on the head of his stick, and began in
an elevated tone, as if anticipating opposition.

and fears, and anxious wishes for her son, and
her commendations of him to his care, he
grieved bitterly at the prospect of yielding
him up, and searched in his heart how it might
be avoided. No plan offered itself': the very
exhibition of any desire to keep him would
have rendered the claimant more peremptory:
there was nothing left but to resign him.
However, he was not going to rouse him from
his sleep.

Linton was very reluctant to be roused
from his bed, at five o'clock, and astonished
to be informed that he must prepare for fur-
ther travelling: but I softened off the matter
by stating that he was going to spend some
time with his father, Mr. Heathcliff, who
wished to see him so much, he did not like to
defer the pleasure till he should recover from
his late journey.

But why have I not heard of him before2''
asked Linton; `` why didn't jammu, and he

 He had business to keep him in the

required her to reside in the south.''
 And why didn't mamma speak to me

often talked of uncle, and lI learnt to love him

I attempted to persuade him of the naughty-

While he was speaking, Joseph returned,
bearing a basin of milk-porridge, and placed
it before Linton. Ho stirred round the home-
ly mess with a look of aversion, and affirmed
he could not eat it.
I saw the old man servant shared largely in
his master's scorn of the child, though he was
compelled to retain the sentiment in his heart,
because Heathcliff plainly meant his underlings
to hold him in honour.

WAs had sad work with little Cathy that day:
she rose in high glee, eager to join her cousin:
and such passionate tears and lamentations
followed the news of his departure, that Ed-
gar, himself, was obliged to sooth her, by a-
firming he should come back soon; he added,
however,  if I can get him;'' and there were
no hopes of that.
This promise poorly pacified her; but time
was more potent; and though still, at inter-
valls, she inuired of her father, when Linton

would return; before she did see him again,
his features had waxed so did in her memory
that she did not recognise him.
When I chanced to encounter the house-
keeper of Wuthering HEIghts, in paying busi-
ness-visits to Immersion, I used to ask how
the young master got on; for he lived almost
as secluded as Catherine herself, and was never
to be seen. I could gather from her that he
continued in weeks health, and was a tiresome
inmate. She said MIr. Heathcliff' seemed to
dislike him ever longer and worse, though he
took some trouble to conceal it. IIe hal an
antipathy to the sound of his voice, and could
not do at all with his sitting in the same roon
ith him many minutes together.
There seldom passed mch talks between
them; Linton lent his lessons, and spent hi
evenings in a small apartment, they called the
parlour; or else lay in bed all day; for he
was constantly getting coughs, and colds, and
aches, and pains of some sort.

And I never knew such a faint-hearted

he must have a fire in the middle of sumer:

he were not his son: and, I'm certain, he
would be fit to turn him out of doors, if he

then, he wont go into danger of temptation:

he never enters the parlour, and should Linton
show those ways in the house where he is, he
sends him up stairs directly.''
I divined, from this account, that utter lack
of sympathy had rendered young Heathcliff
selfish and disagreeable, if he were not as
originally; and my interest in him, cone-
gently, delayed; though still I was moved
with a sense of grief at his lot, and a wish
that he had been left with us.
Mr. Elgar encouraged me to gain inform-
tion; he thought a great deal about his, I
fancy, and would have run some risks to see
him; and he told a once to ask the house-
keeper whether he ever came into the village'
She said he ll only been twice, on horse-
back, accompanying his father: and both times
he pretended to be quite knocked up for three
or four days afterwards.

Time wore on at the Range in its fore

On the anniversary of her birth we never
manifested any signs of rejoiing, because it
was, also, the anniversary of my late mistress's
death. Her father invariably spent that day
alone in the library; and walked, at dusk, a
far as Immersion kirkland, where he would
frequently prolong his stay beyond midnight.
Therefore Catherine was thrown on her own
resources for amusement.
This twentieth of March as a beautiful
spring day, and when her father had retired,
my young lady came down dressed for going
out, and said she had asked to have a gamble
on the edge of the moors with me; and MIr.
Linton had given her leave, if we went only a
short distance, and were back within the hour.
 So make haste, Ellen' she cried. 1

moor.''
 No, it's not,'' she said.  Ive gone very

I put on my bonnet, and sallied out;
thinking nothing more of the matter. She
bounded before me, and returned to my side,
and was off again like a young greyhound;
and, at first, I found plenty of entertainment
in listening to the larks singing far and near;
and enjoying the sweet, warm sunshine; and
watching his, my pet, and my delight, with
her golden ringlets flying loose behind, and her
bright cheek, as soft and pure in its bloom,
as a wild rose, and her eyes radiant with
cloudless pleasure. She was a happy creature.

Cathy had been caught in the fact of plan-

were quantities up here, and I wished to see

Heathcliff glanced at me with an ill-mean-

party, and, consequently, his malevolence to
wards it, and demanded who ``papa'' was?
 MIr. Linton of Thrushcross Grange,'' she
replied.  I thought you did not know to,
or you wouldn't have spoken in that way.''
 You suppose papa is highly esteemed and
respected then:'' he said, sarcastically.

She pointed to Hareton, the other divine-

they gazed with wonder at the change time

Catherine had reached her full height; her

She also got a trick of coming down early
in the morning, and lingering about the kit-
chen, as if she were expecting the arrival of
something; and she had a small drawer in a
cabinet in the library which she would trifle
over for hours, and whose key she took special
care to remove when she left it.
One day, as the inspected this fraser, I ob-
served that the play-things, and trinkets which
recently formed its contents, were transmuted
into bits of folded paper.
My curiosity and suspicions were rouscd; I
determined to take a peep at her mysterious
treasures; so, at night, as soon as she and ny
master were safe up stairs, I searched and rea-
daily found among my house keys, one that
would fit the look. Having opened, I emptied
the whole contents into my apron, and took
them with me to examine at leisure in my on
chamber.
Though I could not but support, I was still
surprised to discover that they were a mass of

were embarrassed and short; gradually how-

foolish as the age of the writer rendered nato-

I thought, were borrowed from a more expe-

Some of them struck me as singularly odd
compounds of armour, and flatess; women-

affected, wordy way that a school-boy might

them aside, re-locking the vacant drawer.

that year, and a few of our fields were still in-
cleared.
Mr. Linton and his daughter would fre.
quietly walk out among the reapers: at the
carrying of the last sheaves, they stayed till
dusk, and the evening happening to be chill
and damp, my master caught a bad cold, that

indoors throughout the whole of the winter,
nearly without intermission.
Poor Cathy, frightened from her little ro-
vance, had been considerably snyder and duller
since its abandonment: and her father insist-
ed on her scaling less, and taking moro ever-
case. She had his companionship no longer:
I esteemed it a duty to supply its black, as
much as possible, with mine; an inefficient
substitute, for I could only spare two or three
hours, from my numerous diurnal occupations,
to follow her footsteps. and then, my society
was obviously less desirable than his.
On an afternoon in October, or the begin-
ning of November, a fresh watery afternoon,
when the turf and paths were rustling with
moist, withered leaves, and the cold, blue sky
was half hidden by clouds, dark grey stream-

to accompany her on a stroll to the bottom of
the park; a formal walk which she generally
affected if low-spirited; and that she invari-
ably was when MIr. Edgar had been worse than
ordinary; a thing never known from his con-
session, but guessed both by her and me from
his increased silence, and the melancholy of
his countenance.
She went sadly on; there was no running
or bounding now:; though the chill wind might
well have tested her to a race. And often,
from the side of my eye, I could detect her
raising a hand, and brushing something off her
cheek.
I gazed round for a means of diverting her
thoughts. On one side of the road rose a
high, rough bank, where hamels and stunted
oaks, with their roots half exposed, held in-
certain tenor: the soil was too loose for the
latter; and strong winds had blown some
nearly horizontal. In summer, Miss Catherine

in the branches, swinging twenty feet above

and her light, childish heart, still considered
it proper to scold every time I caught her at
such an elevation; but so that she knew there
was no necessity for descending. From dinner
to tea she would lie in her breeze-rocked
cradle, doing nothing except singing old songs

birds, joint tenants, feed and entice their young

herself on the top of the wall, reaching over
to gather some hips that bloomed soalet on the
summit branches of the wild rose trees, sha-

In stretching to pull them, her hat fell off;
and as the door was locked, she proposed
scrambling own to recover it. I bid her be
cautious lest so got a fall, and she nimhly dis-
appeared.
But the return was no such easy matter; the
stones were smooth and neatly contented, and
the rosebush, and blackberry stragglers could
yield no assistance in re-ascending. I, like a

I preferred giving him my own, and that satis-

kissed each other and were friends. After
sitting still an hour, I looked at the great
room with its smooth, uncharted floor; and
thought how nice it would be to play in, if we
removed the table; and I asked Linton to call
Hillah in to help us-and we'd have a game at

Linton did not appear to remember what
she talked of; and he had evidently great if-

His lack of interest in the subjects she started,
and his equal incapacity to contribute to her
entertainment were so obvious, that she could
not conceal her disappointment. An indefinite
alteration had come over his whole person and.
manner. The pettishness that might be cares-

WE deferred our excursion till the after-

Catherine's face was just like the landscape
--shadows and sunshine fitting over it, in a-
pid succession; but the shadows rested longer
and the sunshine was more transient, and her
poor little heart reproached itself for even that
passing forgetfulness of its cares
WYe discerned Linton watching at the same
spot he had selected before. My young mis-

solved to stay a very little while, I had better
hold the pony and remain on horseback; but
I dissented, I wouldn't risk losing sight of
the charge committed to me a minute; so we
climbed the slope of heath, together.

Heathcliff' had the key in his hand that re-

with a sort of surprise at her boldness, or,
possibly, reminded by her voice and glance, of
the person from whom she inherited it.
She snatched at the instrument, and half
succeeded in getting it out of his loosened
fingers; but her action recalled him to the

me from interfering a moment. Catherine was
too intent on his fingers to notice his face. He
opened them, suddenly, and resigned the object
of dispute; but, are she had well secured it,
he seized her with the liberated hand, and,
pulling her on his knee, administered, with
the other, a shower of terrific laps on both
sides of the head, each sufficient to have ful-
filed his threat, had she been able to fall.
At this diabolical violence, I rushed on him
furiously.

Cathy ran to me instead of Clinton, and
knelt down, and put her burning cheek on my

into a corner of the seattle, as quick as a mouse,

correction had lighted on another than him.

Catherine pushed another to him, and wiped
her face. I felt disgusted at the little wretch's
composure, since he was no longer in terror for
himself. The anguish he had exhibited on the
moor subsided as soon as ever he entered
Wuthering Heights; so, I guessed he had been
menaced with an awful visitation of wrath, if
he failed in decoding us there; al, that ac-
couplished, he had no further im:cited
fears.
Papa wants us to be married,'' he con-
tinted, after sipping some of the liquid. ` And
he know your papa wouldn't let us marry
now; and he's afraid of my dying, if we wait;

If we had been mad enough to order that

the master's privilege to walk straight in,

The sound of our informant's voice directed
him to the library: he entered; and motioning
him out, shut the door.

 Catherine, by instinct, must have divined
it was obdurate perversity, and not dislike,

remaining an instant, undecided, she stooped,
and impressed on his cheek a gentle kiss.
 The little rogue thought I had not seen

I shook my head reprovingly: and then
she flushed, and whispered-

 The intimacy, thus commenced, grew ra-

After breakfast, Catherine insisted on my

if you neglect it, you shall prove, practically,

As soon as he heard the other members of
the family stirring he retired to his men, and I
breathed freer-But in the afternoon, while
Joseph and Hareton were at their work, he
came into the kitchen again, and with a wild
look, bid me come, and sit in the house-he
wanted somebody with him.
I declined, telling him plainly, that his
strange talk and manner, frightened me, and I
had neither the nerve, nor the will to be his
companion, alone.

Then turning to Catherine, who was there,

He solicited the society of no one more.
At dusk, he went into his chamber-through
the whole night, and far into the morning, we
heard him groaning, and murmuring to himself.
Hareton was anxious to enter, but I bid him
fetch Mr. Icuneth, and he should go in, and
see him.
WHen he came, and lI requested admittance
and tried to open the door, I found it locked;
and Heathcliff bid us be dated.  He was

went away.
The following evening was very wet, indeed
it poured down, till day-dawn; and, as I took
my morning walk round the house, I observed
the master's window swinging open, and the
rain driving straight in.

I thought he intended to cut a caper round

fell on his knees, and raised his hands, and re-
turned thanks that the lawful master and the
ancient stock were restored to their rights.
I felt stunned 'by the awful event; and my
memory unavoidably recurred to former times
with a sort of oppressive success. But poor
Hareton the most wronged, was the only one
that really suffered much. He at by the
corpse all night, weeping in bitter earnest.
THe pressed its hand, and kissed the sarcastic,
savage face that every one else shrank from
contemplating; and bemoaned him with that
strong grief which springs naturally from a
generous heart, though it be tough as tempered
steel.
KEnneth was perplexed to pronounce of what
disorder the master died. I concealed the
fact of his having swallowed nothing for four
days, fearing it right lead to trouble, and
then, i am persuaded he did not abstain on
purpose; it was the consequence of his strange
illness, not the case.

Wo buried him, to the scandal of the whole
neighbourhood, as he had wished. Earnshaw,
and I, the sexton and six men to carry the
fin, comprehended the whole attendance.
The six men departed when they had let it
down into the grave: we stayed to see it co-

green sods, and laid them over the brown
mould himself, at present itis assoothand ver-

on the moor, and even within his house-Idle

at the turn of the Heights, I encountered a
little boy with a deep, and two labs before
him, he was crying terribly, and I supposed
the lambs were skittish, and would not be

lower down.
He probably raised the phantoms from
thinking, as he traversed the moore alone, on
the nonsense he had heard his parents and
companionae repeat-yet still, I don't like being

 Yes,'' answered MIr. Dean, ``as soon as

 No, Mr. Lockwood,'' sid Nelly, shaking

At that moment the garden gate swung to;
the ramblers were returning.

watching their approach through the window.

As they stepped onto the door-stones, and
halted to take a lot look at the moon, or.
more correctly, at each other, by her light, I
felt irresistibly impelled to escape them again:
and, pressing a remembrance into the hand of
MIrs. Dean, and disregarding her postulate-

kitchen, as they opened the house-door, and
