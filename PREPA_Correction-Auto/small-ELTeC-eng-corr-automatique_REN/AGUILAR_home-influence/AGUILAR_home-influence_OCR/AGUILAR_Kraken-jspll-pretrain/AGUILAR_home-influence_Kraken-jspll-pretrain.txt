PREFACE.
TuL following story will, the author trusts, sufficiently
illustrate its title to require but few words in the way
of preface. She is only anxious to impress two facts on
the minds of her readers. The one-that having been
brought before the public principally as the author of
Jewish works, and as an explainer of the HEbrew Faith,
some Christian mothers might fear that the present
Work has the same tendency, and hesitate to place it
in the hands of their children. She, therefore, begs to
assure them, that as a simple domestic story, the
characters in which are all Christians, believing in and
practising that religion, all doctrinal points have been
most carefully avoided, the author seeking only to ills-
rate the spirit of true piety, and the virtues always design-
patel as the Christian virtues thence proceeding. Her sole
aim, with regard to Religion, has been to incite a train
of serious and loving thoughts towards God and man,
especially towards those with whom IIe hss Linked is in
the precious ties of parent and child, brother and sister,
master and pupil.
PEACE.
The second point she is desirous to bring forward, is
her belief, that in childhood and youth the stolen sent-
ment is one of the safest guides to individual character;
and that if, therefore, she hare written more converse-
tion than may appear absolutely necessary for the
elucidation of  Home Influence,'' or the interest of the
narrative, it is from no wish to be diffuse, but merely to
illustrate her own belief. STINT is the vehicle of
rock, and for the origin of acros. CHiLd-
ren and youth has very seldom the power to evinee
character by action, and scarcely if ever understand the
mystery of thought; and therefore their unrestrained
conversation may often greatly and parents and teachers
in ensuring a correct idea of their natural disposition,
and in giving hints for the mode of education each
may demand.
Leaving the beaten track of works written for the
young, the author's aim has been to assist in the education
of the n, believing that of infinitely greater im-
importance than the mere instruction of the atIxD, for the
bright awakening of the latter, depends far more on
the happy influences of the former than is generally
supposed.
Truce moral of the following story the author known-
ledges is addressed to mothers only, for on them so
much of the responsibility of lIme Influence derolves.
rECENT.
vii
On the, more than on any other, depends the well-doing
and happiness, or the error and grief, not of childhood
alone, but of the far more dangerous period of youth.
A prefect is not the place to enter on their mission.
The author's only wish i, to and by the thoughts,
which in some young mothers, anxious and eager to
perform their office, her story may excite. To daughters
also, she hopes it may not be found entirely useless, for
on them rests so much of the happiness of home, in the
simple thought of, and attention to, those little things
which so bless and inigorate domestic life. Op-
opportunities to evince the more striking virtues women
may never have, but for the cultivation an performance
of the lesser, they are called upon each day.
Should the story be deemed so far incomplete, as not
sufficiently to illustrate the fruits of the Home Influx-
ence it narrates, the conclusion, in a separate stor,
shall willingly he gien.

A LAYER.-A PROMISE.-A NEW RELATION.
In a very beautiful pastor Wales, between the northern
boundaries of Glamorgan and the south-eastern of Car-
marthenshire, there stood, some twenty or thirty years
ago. a small straggling village. Its locality was so
completely concealed that the appearance of a gentle-
man's carriage, or in fact of any vehicle superior to a
light spring-cart, as of such extremely rare occur-
rence as to be dated, in the annals of Llangwillan, as
a remarkable went, providing the simple villagers with
amusing wonderment for weeks.
The village was scattered over the side of a steep and
rugged hill; and on the east, emerging from a think
hedge of news and places, peeled forth the pic-
treasure old church, whose tin-coated spire glittering
in the faintest sunshine removed all appearance of
gloom from the thick trees, and seemed to whisper;
whatever darkness lingered round, light was always
shining there. The churchyard, which the news and
marches screened, was a complete natural gurley, from
the holy cottage flowers, planted by loving hands
over many a ray grace, and so hallowed that not a

walls were cover with jasmine, roses, and honey-
suckle, marked the humble residence of the village
minister who, though in worldly rank only a poor
curate, from his spiritual gifts deserved a much higher
grade.
A gurgling stream ran leaping and sparkling over the
eggy hill till it formed a deep wide hel for itself along
the road leading to the nearest town, embarked on one
side by a tall leafy hctge, and on the other by rich grace
and meadow flowers. By the side of this stream grips
of village children were continually found, sometimes
reading for some particular flower or insert, or floating
pieces of wool with a twig stuck upright within them
as tiny fleets; but this amusement had gien place the
last ten days to the greater excitement of watching the
progress of a miniature frigate, the workmanship of a
young lad who had only cry lately become an inmate
of the village. All had been at length completed, sails,
ropes, and masts, with a degree of nentness and beauty,
showing not only ingenuity but observation: and once
lovely summer evening the ceremony of launching took
place. or a few minutes she tattered anl reeled amidst
the tiny breakers, then suddenly regained her equilibrium
and dashed gallantly along. A loud shout burst from
the group, from all save the owner, a beautiful boy of
some twelve years, who contented himself with raising

nd triumphantly round him. One glance would suffice

cumstauces, not from choice, to mingle with them. So
absorbed was the general attention that the very unusual
sound of carriage-wheels as remarked until close
beside them, and then so astounding was the sight of a
private carriage, and the coleman's very simple ques-
tion if that road led to the village, that all hung back
confused. The owner of the little sessel, however, an-
swerved proudly and briefly in the affirmative. `` And
c you direct me, my good boy,''inquired a lady, looking
from the window, and smiling kindly at the abashed
group, `` to the residence of MIr. Fortescue, it is out of
the village, is it not ?
 Mrs. Fortescuel'' repeated the boy eagerly, and
gladly, and his cap was off his head in a moment, and
the bright sunshine streamed on a face of such remark-
able beauty, and withal so familiar, that though the lady
bent eagerly forward to address him, emotion so choked
her voice that the law was enabled to reply to her inquiry,
and direct the coaching to the only in of the village,
and they had driven off before words returned.
The boy looked eagerly after them, then desiring one
of his companions to meet the lady at the inn, and guide
her to the cottage, caught up his little vessel, and darted
off across some field which led by a shorter cut to the
same place.
It was a very humble dwelling, so surrounded by hills
that their shadow always seemed to overhang it: yet
within, the happy temper of a poor widow and her
daughter kept up a perpetual sunshine. Three weeks
previous to the evening we have mentioned, a lady and
two children had ariel at Llangwillan, unable to pro-
reed farther from the severe disposition of the former.

the invalid; hal her removed from the inn to WIdow

not listen to the peace he proffercd, and so painful
did his gentle eloquence appear to irritate instead of calm,
that he desisted, earnestly praying that her sister might
answer the letter in person, and by removing anxiety
prepare the mind for better thoughts.
One object alone had power to bring something like
a smile to that altered, but still most beautiful, county-
ance, conquer een irritation, and still create intervals
of pleasure-it was her on, the same beautiful boy we
have already noticed, and whose likeness to herself was
so extraordinary that it would have been almost too

passionate tears, and shake her slight frame as with

The way we have mentioned, Elward had been absent
longer than usual, and toward evening MIrs. Fortescue
awoke from a troubled sleep to brood oer these thoughts,
taIl they had produced their usual effect in tears and
sobs, the more painful to witness from the increasing
physical incapacity to struggle with them.
A little girl, between on and eleven years old, was
seated on a low wooden stool, half concealed by the
coarse curtain of the bed, employed in sewing some
bright gilt buttons on a blue jacket. It seemed hard
work for those small delicate hands; but she did not
look up from her task till roused by the too familiar
sound of her mother'as suffering, and then, as she raised
her head, and flag back the heavy and somewhat dis-
ordered ringlets, thc impulse seemed to be to spring up
and try to soothe, but a mournful expression quickly
succeeded, and she sat several minutes without moving.
At length, as MIrs. Fortescue's sobs seemed almost to
suffocate her, the child gently bent or her, saying,
very timely, ``bDcnr mamma, shingle I call Wide MOrgan,
or can I get anything for you'' and, without waiting
for a reply, save the angry negative to the first question,
she held a glass of water to her mother's lips and

IIe has gone down to the stream to launch his little
frigate, MIamma, and asked me to fasten these buttons
on his jacket to make it look like a sailor' s meanwhile;
I do not think he will be very long now.''
Mrs, Fortescue made no rejoinder, except to utter aloud
those thoughts which had caused her previous paroxysm,
and her little girl, after a very evident struggle with
her own painful timidity, ventured to say:
' But why should you fear so much for Edward, dear
MIamma? Everybody loves him and admires him, so I
am sure my aunt and uncle will''
Your anna may for my sake, but she will not love
or bear with his childish faults as I have done; and
your uncle is such a harsh, stern man, that there is
little hope for his forbearance with my poor Edward.
And he is so franke and bold, he will not know how een
to conceal his boyish errors, and he will be punished,
and his fine spirit broken, and who will be there to
shield and soothe him .'
I may be able sometimes, 3Gamma, anl indeed, in-
deed, I will whenever I can,'' replied her child, with
aiicctipng carnestness. tI loe him so very very much,
and I know he is so much better than I am, that it will
be very easy to help him whenever I can.''
 Will you promise me, Ellen, will you really promise
me to shield him, and save him from harshness when-
her it is in your power,'' exclaimed MIrs. Fortcscue, ss
eagerly, that she half raised herself, and pressed Ellen
to her with an appearance of affection so unusual, and
a kiss so warm, that that moment never passed from the

in her own heart with a solemnity and firmness ol pnr-
pose little imagined by her mother, who when she
demanded it, conceived neither its actual purport nor
extent; she only felt relied the llward would have
some one by him to love him and enable him to conceal
his errors, if he should commit any.
HAd she studied and known the character of Ellen
as she did that of her son, that promise would perhaps
never have been asked; nor would she so cautiously
and mistakenly have laid so great a stress upon con
elements, as the only sure means of guarding from
blame. From her childhood Mrs, kortescue had been
a creature of passion and impulse, and maternity had
unhappily not altered one tittle of ler character. In
what manner, or at what cost, Ellen might be enabled
to keep that promise, never entered her mind. It had

MIrs. Fortescue pressed him closer and closer to her,
returning his kisses with such passionate fondness, that
tears mingled with them and fell upon his cheek.
 Don't cry, Mlamma, dear? indeed, indeed, my aunt
will soon come. Do you know I think I have seen her
and spoken to her, too,''
 Seen her, Edward? You mean you have dreamed
abaont her, and so fancy you have seen her;'' but the
teaser anxious look sle fixed on him cvinced more
hope than her words.
:No, no, MIamma:; as we were watching my ship, a
carriage passed us, and a lady spoke to me, and asked
me the way to the cottage where you lived, and I am
sure it is aunt Emmelinc from her smile.''
'It cannot be,'' murmured his mother, sally ; '` un-

listened eagerly.  Yes, yes, I am right, and she is

flight of stairs in two bounds, he rushed into the little
parlour, caught holD of the lady's dress, and exclaimed,

mamma, she has been wanting you so long, so very
long, and you will make her well, dear aunt, will you not?''
 Oh, that I may indeed be allowed to do so, lear
holy'' was the painfully agitated reply, and she hastened
p the stairs.
But to Edward's grief and astonishment, so little
was he conscious of his mother's exhausted state, the
sight of his aunt, prepared in some measure as she
was, seemed to bring increase of suffering instead of
joy. There was a convulsive effort for speech, a ps-
sionate return of her sister's embrace, and she fainted.
Edward in terror flung himself beside her, treating
her not to look so pale, but to wake and speak to him.

moment caused her aunt to laole at her ith astonish-

GLIMPSES ITO A CHILD's HEART.-A DETAILED.
O leasing the cottage, Ellen hastily traverse the
little garden, and entered a narrow lane, leading to
MIr. Marvin's dwelling. TIer little heart was swelling
high within her, and the confinement she has endured,
the constant control she exercised for fear she should
add to her other's irritation, combined with the ers-
treme delicacy of natural constitution, had so weakened
her, as to render the slightest exertion painful. She
had been so often reproved as fretful and ill-tempered,
whenever in tears, that she always checked and con-
sealed them. She had been so frequently told that she
did not know what affection was, that she was so
inanimate and cold, that though she did not understand
the actual meaning of the words, sle believed she was
different to any one else, and was happy without
knowing why. Compared with her brother, she ccr-
mainly was neither a pretty nor an cnging child.
Wildly from her birth, her residence in India had in-
creascd constitutional delicacy, nd while to a watchful
eye the expression of her counlcuace denoted constant
suffering, the helpless anl superficial observer would
condemn it as pcevishness, and so unnatural to a young
child, that noting but confirmed ill-temper could have
produced it. The soft beautifully-formed black eye
was too large for her other cultures, and the slowness

of her complexion, the heavy tresses of very dark hair,
caused her to be remarked as a very plain child, which
in reality she was not. Accustomed to hear beat
extolled able everything else, beholding it in her
mother and brother, and imagining it was edward's
great beauty that always made him so beloved and
netted, an oil-disposed child would have felt nothing
but easy and dislike towards him. But Ellen felt
neither. She led im levotedly ; but that any one
could love her, of that the only one who eer had-
her idolized father-was dead, she thought impossible.
WHy er heart and temples beat so quickly as she
left her mother's room-why the promise she had so
lately made should so cling to her mind, that even her
aunt's arrival could not remove it-why she felt so
giddy and went as to render walking painful, the poor
child could not have told, but, unable at length to go
farther, she sat down on a grassy bank, ad helping
herself site alone, cried bitterly. Several minutes
passed and she did not look up, till a well-known voice
inquired:-
`Dear Ellen, that is the matter? Whnt has lap-
pence to grieve you so to-day on't you tell me?''
Indeed, indeed, I do not know, dear arthur; I
only feel-feel-as if I had not so much strength as I
had a few days ago-and, and I could not help crying.''
 You are not well, Ellen,'' replied her companion,
a fine lad of sixteen, and Mr. Myrsin's only son.
 You are looking paler than I ever saw you before ; let
me call my father. you know he is always pleased
when he sees you, and he hoped you would have been
to us before to-day; come with me to him now,''

No, Arthur, indeed I cannot; he will think I ve
forgotten all he said to me the last time I saw him, and,
indeed, i have not-but I-I do not know what is the
matter with me to-day.''
And, in spite of all her efforts to restrain them, the
tears would burst forth afresh; and Arthur, finding all
his efforts at consolation ineffectual, contented himself
with putting his arm around her and kissing them away.
A few minutes afterwards his father appeared.
`In tears, my dear Ellen t'' he said, kindly; ``your
mother is not worse, I hope ?''
 I do not know, sir,'' replied the child, as well as
her tears would permit; `` she has been very ill just now,
for her faint was longer than usual.''

I think it was seeing my ant. Milan was very
much agitated before and afterwards,''
'MIrs. HAmilton has carried then I am rejoiced
to hear it,'' replied Mr. Marin, gladly. Then sitting
down by Ellen, he took one of her hands in his, and
said, kindly, `` Something has gricved ny little girl this
evening; I will not ask what it is, because you may not
like to tell me; but you must not imagine evils, Ellen.
I know you have done, and are doing, the duty of a

bearing with intervals of impatience, which hcr invalid

quietly by her: I have not seen you, my child, but I

happy, for can neer laugh and sing, and talk, as
edward does.''
: You are not in such strong health as your brother,
my dear little girl, and yon hare had many things to
make you happy, which Edward has not. But you
must try and remember that even if it please God
that sometimes you should be more sorrowful than
other children, He goes you notwithstanding. I am
sure you have not forgotten the story of Joseph that
I told you a few Sundays ago. God so loved it, as to
give him the power of foretelling events, and enabling
him to do a great deal of good, but when he was taken
away from his father and sold as a slave, and thrown into
prison amongst cruel strangers, he could not have been
very happy, Ellen. Yet still, young as he was, little
more than a child in those days, and thrown amongst
those who did not know right from wrong, he reem-
berel all that his father had taught him, and prayed ta
Gol, and tried to love and obey IIi; and God was
pleased with him, and gave him grade to continue good,
and at last so blessed him, as to permit him to see his
dear father and darling brother again,''
`But Joseph was his father's favorite child,'' was
Ellen's sole rejoinder; and the tears, which were checked

the nearest town was twenty miles distant), but not a
selfish or refining thought entered MIrs. Hamilton's
mind. It was filled with thankfulness, not only that
she was permitted thus to tend a sister, whom neither
error, nor absence, nor silence could estrange from her
heart, but that she was spared long enough for her
gentle influence and enduring love to have some effect
in changing her train of thought, coming that fearful
irritability, and by slow degrees permitting her to look
with resignation and penitent hope to that hour which
no human fort could alert. That MR. Marvin should
seek MIrs. HAmilton's society and delight in conversing
with her, MIrs. Fortescue considered so perfectly nato-
ral, that the conversations which took place in her sick
roon, whenever she was strong enough to bear them,
excited neither surprise nor impatience. Different as
she was, wilfully as she had alway neglected the mild
counscls and example of her sister, the years of sepa-

never found any one at all like her,-so good and holy,

these feelings.

Mr. Hamilton, and so a change in sentiments was gra-
dually wrought, which by any other and harsher me-
thor of proceeding would have been sought for in vain.
One evening as MIrs. HAmilton sat watching the
faded countenance of her patient, and recalling those
days of youth and buoyancy, when it seemed as if
neither death nor care could ever hae assailed one as
bright and lovely, Edward, before he sought his favorite
stream, threw his arms round her neck, and pressed
his rosy lips of her cheek, as thus to wish her good
bye.

She ceased from exhaustion, but the flush which had
risen to her temples, and the trembling hands evinced
the agitation always called for by the mention of her

endeavoured to soothe

nand clinging trust to which she was at last permitted to
attain. Though Irs. HAmilton was detained six weeks
at langwillan, her devoted attendance on her sister
prevented anything more than occasional observation of
the children so soon about to be committed to her care.
That eDward was most engaging and riveted her affection
at one, and that Ellen was unlike any child she had
ever known or seen, she could not but feel, but she was
not one to decide on a mere feeling. Her present
mournful task prentice all actual interference with
them, except the endeavour by kindly notice to win
their confidence and love. IIis mother's illness and his
uncle's presence, besides, for the present, his perfect
freedom with regard to employment, had decried
Edward of all inclination to rebel or exert his self-will,
and Mr. and MIrs. HAmilton both felt that he certainly
had fewer faults, than was generally the consequence of
unlimited indulgence. Wether Ellen's extreme attend-

We the broken sentences that, in a voice scarcely
audible, and at long intervals, escaped MIrs. TFortescue'as
lips, and then her head sunk lower on MIrs. Hamilton's
bosom, and there was a long, long silence, broken only
by Edward's low and half-suffocated sobs. And he
knew not, guessed not the grief that was impending.
He only felt that his mother as worse, not better, as
the ad believed would and must be when his aunt ar-
fired. He had never seen death, though Ellen had;
and he had passionately and wilfully refused either to
listen to or believe in his uncle's and MIr. MArin's
gentle attempts to prepare him for his loss. Terrified
at the continued silence, at the cold easy feel of his
mother's hand, as, when MIr. Morin and the widow
gently removed er from the still-supporting arm of
MIrs. Hamilton, it fell against his, he start up, and
clinging to his aunt, implored her to speak to him, to
tell him why his mother looked so strange and white,
her hand felt so cold, and why she would not speak to
and kiss him, as she always did, when he was grieved.
MIrs. HAmilton raised her head from her husband's
shoulder, and struggling with her own deep sorrow,
she drew her orphan nephew closer to her, and said, in
a low earnest voice, ` MIy Edward, did you not hear

`And will she never, never speak to me again? ill

mamma, ohl do not go away from me-or let me go with
you-let me die to ; no one will lore me or kiss me as you

gave way before his grief; he clung to the body of his
mother so passionately, so conclusively, that it required
actual force to remove him. nd for hours his aunt
and sister watched over and tried to soothe and comfort
him in vain; he would only rouse himself angrily to ask
Ellen how she could know what he felt; she had never
loved their mother as he had-she did not know what
s a lot-she could not feel as he did, and then
relapse into tears and sobs. Ellen did not attempt
reply. She thought, if it were such pain to her to lose

affection for her, it must indeed be still more suffering
to him; and though his angry words grieved and hurt

her to love and admire him still more, and to believe
that she really did not feel as much as he did. And yet
before they quieted Ilangillan, which they did the
second day after MIrs. Fortescue's funeral, Edward could
laugh and talk as usual-except when any object re-
called his mother; and poor Ellen felt that though she
had fancied she was not happy before, she was much
more unhappynow. Her fancy naturally vivid, and ren-
derek more so from her having been left so much to
herself, dwelt morbidly on all that had passed in her
mother's illness, on every cares, very unusual word of
affection, and on Mr. MIyrvrin's assurance that she would
love her in Heaven; the promise she had made to love
and help Edward returned to her memory again and
again, and each time with the increased determination
to keep it usually. It was not for her mother's sake
aulonc, and connected only with her; perhaps, had it not
been for the careful instructions of her father, whom,
as we shall presently see, she had had cause almost to
idolise, Ellen might have become indifferent to her
mother and envious of Edward. But his repeated
instructions, under all circumstances, to love, cherish,
and they her mother, had been indelibly engraved, and
heightened natural feeling. Sho believed that to keep
the promise, which had so evidently pleased her mother,
would be also obeying her father, and this double
incentive gave it a weight and consequence, which, could
Mrs. HAmilton have known it, would have caused her

she received, when Arthur explained that had detained

The novelty of his situation, the rapid and pleasant
movement of his uncle's carriage, the idea of the new
relations he was about to meet, and an confessed but
powerful feeling of is of increased consequence in
being so nearly connected to earth and distinction, all

RETROSPECTIVE0ON.-THE LOWLY sOUGHT,-THE ALGTY

I order clearly to understand the allusions of the
previous chapters, and the circumstances which had
formed the different characters of MIrs. HAmilton and
MIrs. Fortescue, it will be necessary to take a retro-
spcctive glance on their early lives. Should it be union-

but to their elder relatives, we hope the matter ill
prove of sufficient interest to obtain perusal.
Emmeline and Eleanor MIners were the daughters
of Lord Delmont, a nobleman whose title and rank were
rather burdensome than otherwise, from the want of
sUfficient means to keep them up as inclination and
position warranted. Lady Delmont, whose energetic
yet gentle character would have greatly amelioratcd tha
petty vexations of her husband, lied when Emmeline
was only seven, eleanor five, and Charles, her only
by, an infant of tlc years old. A widow lady,
Mrs. HArcourt by name, had been selected by Lady
Delmont, iu hcr last illness, as instructors and guardian
of her daughters. ller wishes, always laws to hcr

Harcourt, two months after her friend's death, assumed
the arduous and responsible duties for which her high
character well fitted her.
With Emmeline, though there were naturally some
faults to correct, an insolence and weakness to over-
come, and apparently no remarkable natural aptitude
for requirement, her task was comparatively easy, for
her pupil had the capabilities, not only of affection but
of reference to a very great extent, and once loving and
respecting MIrs. llarcaurt, not a command was new-
elected for a wish unfulfilled. Eleanor, an the con-
tracy, though so gifted that teaching might have been
a complete labour of love-by self-will, violent passions,
and a most determined want of veneration, een
of common respect, a resolute opposition from her
earliest ears to the wishes of MIrs. Harcourt, because
she was merely a governess, so much her inferior in
rank, rendered the task of education one of the most
difficult and painful that can be conceived,-increased
from the judicious partiality of Lord bElmont. It was
not indeed the culpable negligence and dislike which
Eleanor afterwards displayed towards her own, but
originating in the fancy that Mrs. HArcourt was unjust,
anl emmeline was her favorite. Lord Delmont was
one of those unfortunately weak irresolute characters
that only behold the surface of things, and are there-
for utterly incapable of acting either with vigour or
judgment. When he did venture into the precincts of
his daughters' apartments, he generally found Eleanor
in jobs and teams, and Emmeline quietly pursuing her
daily duties. That Mars. Harcourt often contrasted his

of conduct, be never remembered longer than the time
her expostulations last. Once or twice indeed he
lit begin to speak seriously, but Eleanor would throw
her arms round his week and kiss him, call him very
endearing name, and beg him not to look so much
like grace, cross irs. IIareourt, or she should think
she had indeed no one to love her; and her beautiful
eyes would swell with tears, and her voice quiser, so
that her gratified father would forget all his reproof
and give her somc indulgence to make up for the in-
justice and harshness she encountered in the school-
tom. TIer power once thus experienced, of course,
was never resigned. TIer father's appearance in their
study was always the signal for her tears, which she
knew would confirm all his ideas of Mrs. HArcourt's
unjust partiality.
And this idea was strengthened as they grew older,
and masters for anions accomplishments somewhat
lightened Mars. Harcourt's actual labonrs. Emmeline's
steady application and moderate abilities were last sight
of in the applause always elicited by her younger sister;
whose natural gifts alike in music, languages, and
drawing had full play, directly she was released even
in part for the hated thraldom of her governess.-

thus seeking to curry favour. MIrs. HArcourt was the
only one from whom he never heard Eleanor's praises,
and the only one, who spoke in praise of Emmeline. It
must then be wilful blindness on her part, and the father
felt indignant, but in spite of himself had too much rel
respect for her individually to do more than redouble
his indulgence to Eleanor. kEmmeline could not eom-
plain of her father's neglect, for he was both kind and
affectionate to her; but she did sometimes wish she
could be quite sure that he loved her as much as her
sister; and her deep affections, nnsuspeetel by her father,
rejected and laughed at by Eleanor, twined themselves
closer and closer round MIrs. HArcourt, and her brother
Charles, on whom she actually doted, and who returned
her affection with one quite as fond and arm, as a
happy, laughter-long, frank-hearted boy had it in his
power to bestow; yet even his holidays were times of
as much suffering as joy to his sister, from the violent
quarrels which were continually taking place between
him and Eleanor. Emmeline, happy in herself and
MIrs. HArcourt's companionship, could endure Eleanor's
determined supremacy and, except where her conscience
disapproved, yielded to her. but this could not be
expected from Charles, who, despite his elder sister's
gentle entreaties, would stand up for what he called her
rights, and declare that when he was at home, Miss
Eleanor should not lord it over the whole family.
Eleanor only of course quarrel first with him and the
appeal to her father, who without hearing the case
would give her right, and harshly condemn Carles,
whose high spirit revolted; and unable to bear with his
father's weakness of character, as he ought to have done,

till Charles in a desperate passion would seek Lime-
line's chamber, and his father, though he actually deeply
loved and was very proud of his son, wished that the
holidays were over and Charles safe again at school.
Trifling as domestic disputes may seem in description,
they never fail in their painful reality to banish all
lasting happiness, Emmeline could bear that her father
should prefer Eleanor to herself, but that he should be
just to her darling Charles, and that Charles should
increase this evil by dispute and self-will, tried hen
severely, and obliged her often and often to fly to the

heartfelt pity, which she had sought to instil into her
youthful charge, even more by the examples of her daily
lite than by precepts, had become Emmeline's, young
as she still was, and enabled her not only to bear up
against the constant petty anoyances of her hong, but
the heavy trial sustained in the death of Mrs. IlIarcourt,
just as she was looking forward to her entrance in the
gay world, under her maternal guardianship, and her
parting with her brother, who not two months after-

Nacelles and Eleanor's passionate entrcaties had pre-
railed on Lord Delmout to permit his daughter being
more witli hcr than with her sister and governess.
Lady Nacelles was a woman of the world, utterly
heartless, highly distinguished, and supremely fashion-
able. At her house all the top of the head monde
congregated, and scandal, frivolity, and esprit were the
prevailing topics, diversified with superficial opinions
of the literature, arts, and politics of the day, and
various sentimental episodes, which the lady of the
house endured for the sake of variety. IIere Eleanor,
even at fourteen, was made a popular idol; er extreme
beauty, hcr city, hcr talents, her sharpness of
reported, all were admired, extollel, and encouraged.
At seventeen she was introduced and initiated into all
the mysteries of an ultra-fashionable life, and very
speedily added to her other accomplishments-all the
arts of a finished and heartless coquette.
With Lady lLascelles for hcr chaperon, it was not
very surprising that Emmeline MIners shrunk in pain
and real from her introduction into society; but yet
she knew her social duties too well to refuse, and, by
an affectation of superior sanctity, which of course
would have been the charge levelled against her, throw
a anger upon those holy feelings and spiritual prince-
plus which had become part of her very being. She
entered into society, but the isolation to a heart like
her of the coteries of Lady Nacelles and her friends,
was indeed most painful, and aggravated by the constant
deal which the contemplation of Eleanor's reckless
career could not but occasion.

attention of both sisters was attracted to a young an,
by name Arthur Hamilton-Eleanor, from his dustin-
guished appearance and extreme reserve, Emmeline, by
the story attached to his name. IIis father had so
distinguished himself in the amelioration of the pea-
pantry and working classes in various parts of England,
in addition to various services of a private and confi-
dental nature from the home government to the
courts abroad, that a viscount was offered to his
acceptance. The message from royalty reached him on
his death-bed, and though, from the faint anl flickering
accents with which he replied to the intended honour,
it seemed as if he declined it, it was attributed to the
natural feelings of a dying man, seeing the utter
nothingness of earthly honours, and the title was gene-
rousey proposed to his son. But Arthur Hamilton had
not been the pupil and friend of his father in vain.
With a calm dignity and uncompromising independence,
he declared that he had neither claim nor airship to
the reward of his father's services; that he believed his
parent would himself have refused it, preferring the
honorable distinction of being an untitled English gen-
tleman, to the unarmed honour of a newly-created
lordship. He respectfully thanked the government
for the honour they intended, bUt decisively refused it-
that his densest inheritance was his father's name.

ELEANOR's unfounded dislike towards Arthur FAmily-
to did not decrease when he became her brother-in-
law; she chose to believe that he had injured her by
being the only one who had remained proof against all
the fascination she had thrown in his way. Been in
her childhood, if any one chanced to notice Emmeline
more than herself it was considered a martial offence,
and the person who had so offended was scarcely spoken
to gain. Therefore that Emmeline should he married
before herself, nod to the man she intended to captivate,
but ot fo ore, or wed, was an offence visited on her
sister by the withdrawal of her speech for six months,
and on MIr. HAmilton by an insulting haughtiness of de-

her extreme annoyance, she found that even as she had
failed to fascinate, she equally failed to offend. IIe

T6 kEmmeline, the change in her young life was so
marvellous, so complete- care, anxiety, loneliness, that
sinking of the whole frame and heart, from the absence
of appreciation and social kindness, had so departed,
leaving in their stead such an intensity of quiet domes-
tic happiness, that it was long before her full heart
would believe it reality, and rest secure. She had always
longed for one to reverence, to cling to, and her husband
gave her room for both. As his betrothed, even before
their marriage, she had been introduced to very different
society to that of the MIarchioness; she heheld him
reverenced, loved, appealed to by the wisest and the
best men, often older than himself. That this man
should so love, cherish, and actually reverence her, no
wonder that under the magic of such feelings her cha-

Lady Nacelles. As to joining society with MIr. and
Mrs. Hamilton, when they were in London, Eleanor
would not hear of it. But to her sister's great joy and
some surprise, she accepted an invitation to Haywood,
a short time after little Perey's birth, and, still more
surprising, condescended to make herself agreeable.
The London season had tired her, and she thought she
might just as well be all on the banks of the Art in
August and September as in some stupid watering-place.

to avo, she only could be at least very entertaining;

lIes visit to her father in London in the winter re-
moved all their rising hopes, and caused such increased
and intense anxiety, as so to injure her already delicate
health that her husband home her back to Haywood a
full month before they had originally intended.-
Whether or not Eleanor led Lord Fitzeclair, it was
impossible to determine; but that deotcdly, passion-
lately loved her, was only too evident, not only to the
world hot to herself, and this once confirmed, she left
a method untriel to torment, and so, as she eclarel

passions of that country, without one atom of self-con-

him desperate and miserable: he resumed, started in
vain. `She only wants to try the strength of my
lore,'' was his sole reply; '`and were she to torment
health and life as, it will interchange;-she will be
mine yet.''
And to the astonishment of Mr. and MRs. Hamilton,
two months afterwards he proposed in form, and actu-
ally was accepted, with the sole condition that their

Eleanor to name the wedding day, which could not be

was still of course the star. MIrs. HAmilton entered the
nursery one morning earlier than usual, for her infant
had not been well the night before, and she had already
experienced the care as well as the joy of a mother. TIer
babe was better, and as he lay smiling and happily in
her lap, and watched the eager movements of his
brother, she was only sensible of pleasure. The nurse
had arranged the chairs in a long line, that MIster
Perey might, with their help, walk the whole length of
the large and airy room. The feat mightily pleased
the little gentleman, who having acquired the venerable
age of fifteen months, liked better to feel his feet than
crawl on the floor, or be carried about on any limbs but
his own. eVery two or three paces he stood nearly
alone, and burst into a loud merry laugh, which was
always echoed by a crowd of joy from his little brother.
 Take care, Percy, love, don't fall and frighten

him with such pleasure as to send for his father to
share it. Wen her son, to prove how well le obeyed
her commands to take care, stood for a second without

expressed alarm had nearly overpowered ler; and in
a few minutes Emmeline was with her husband, whose
agitation was so excessive, that even his wife's presence

The tale was soon told. Eleanor's conduct since her
engagement had been such as to excite the displeasure,
not of her father alone, but actually of the Marchioness;
who, though a weak and worldly woman, had yet some
in of propriety. As a near relation of Lord Delmont,
Eleanor's engagement with Lord Fitzelir was of course
told to her, and again and again she warned her that
she was going too far, and might lose her lower before
she was aware of it; but eleanor only laughed at her,
and at last won her over to the belief that it was her-
mainly better to cure Fitzclair of his jealous tendency
before marriage than afterwards. Lord dElmont's re-
proofs she was wont to silence, by invariably making
them the signal of mortifying and annoying Lord
Fitzclair still more than usual. Yet still at times she

so enhanced her own fascination, that all the agony he
had endured and was still, he knew, to endure, by an
incomprehensible contradiction, riveted her power and
hastened his own doom. WAlk in all things but his

location of their engagement. Eleanor owed if he did,

her actions, which she did not choose to endure. And
father, lower, and friend, all feeling she was wrong, and
the first and last repeatedly telling her so, had yet
neither of them the resolution to contend with her, and
compel the proper course.
A month of their visit to Cheltenham so passed, when
Eleanor's attention was arrested by a new actor of the
scene. She had begun to time of her present satellites,

living himself decidedly the object of Ecuador's pre-

mined coldness to herne suitor. Finding at length that
her encouragement actually neared a criminal extent, and
after a desperately stormy interview, he solemnly de-
clawed that if she did not dismiss Captain Tortescue at
once, he would shame her in the face of the whole
world, by proclaiming her engagement with the young
Marquis. Eleanor in equal anger declared that if he
threatened, so too could she, and if he tormented her
any more she would prevent all publication of her en-
gagement, by herself snapping it asunder, and pledging
her faith to Captain Forteseue. This was too much
even for Lord Delmont. Declaring if she did so, a
father's heaviest mnlediction should fall on her head,

went to prepare for an excursion on horseback with
Fortescue, Fitzclair, and others.
When Lord Delmont's passions were once roused,
een his ordinarily slender judgment entirely forsook
him, and he did that which at another time, knowing
Fitzelair as he did, he would have shrunk from. HE
sought him while still exasperated, upbrnided him for
his weakness in permitting eLeanor's unprincipled con-
duct, and warned him that, if he is not adapt some
strong measures to prevent it, he would certainly lose
her entirely.
The young man heard him without reply; but his
face grew livid, and he clenched his hand till the blood
started from the nails, and in this mool of concentrated
passion joined the riding arty. The exercise itself is
to some temperaments unusually exciting, and the de-
remained coldness of Eleanor to himself, and the
eagerly-received delation of Fortescue, madden him.

finally, reproached. Eleanor, already irritated; and be-
yong all that her lover, in general so obsequious and
humble, should are to call her to account, for more
amusement, combined with the recollection of Captain
Fortescue's flattering own and willing homage; excited
her to an extent of which she as herself unconscious,
inasmuch as she firmly believed, ' whatever she might
say then, a few soft words would speedily obliterate.
She told him that really his jealous temperament was
beyond all endurance; that he certainly must intend
her to despise and abhor him; and that the contrast to
presented to Captain Fortescue was such as to make her
most heartily wish to put an end to their engagement,
as she felt quite sure it must only end in misery for
both; and, without waiting for a reply, she multiply
hrushel by him and disappeared.
Of the extent of Fitclir's passion Eleanor had not
the least idea, and this is saying a great deal, for the
generally exaggerated her own power. She believed
she had inflicted pain, but not as much as he deserved;
and determined that she would torment him it more
at the ball that evening. But to her extreme mortifi-
section he did not happen, and there was a vague dread
on her spirits as she retired for the night, which pre-
vented anything like rest. lIes absence hd excited
surprise in all, especially Lady Nacelles, who knew

most painful excitement by the incomprehensible and
most extraordinary fact of the suicide of Lord Fitzelair;
by what oceasioned, plunged into such mystery that
nothing but sudden aberration of mind was imagined,
a belief justified by the very peculiar temperament and
manners of the young nobleman during his sojourn with
them. IIis will, a valuable present, with a few lines of
regard to his faithful attendant, and a letter addressed
to Arthur Hamilton, Esq., were the sole evidence that
the awful deed had not been committed without some
preparation; but is that was often the case with mad-
ess itself, it excited no remark.
The state of Eleanor's mind when these awful ridings
were communicated to her, which they were by her
father, in his agitation and anger, without the least
preparation, we lene our readers to imagine. Har-
denied, heartless, wilful as she was, she was still a

Fortescue appeared, had loved, as far as it was in her

to do with his miserable end was an attempt to rain

struggle to realize it; remorse in all its torturing, uni-
tigated anguish took possession of her, but instead of
leading her to penitence, and thence the hope of peace,
it urged her to a course of action from which she
imagined there was no withdrawing, and which must
in time, by removing her from all painful associations,
lessen her present misery.
For three days and nights she never quittel her own

official roses, and her gay smiles and joyous allies were
tempered only by a judicious-expressed honor when
the late event was discussed before her, supposed natural

hours of loneliness which followed this conduct in
society were terrible indeed. bY a strange contrariety

and her artificial, which had, alas only too forcibly

Lord Delmont was himself in a most pitiable con-
dition; even minor evils had always been great to him,
and the effect of this, the wish to take Eleanor away
from Captain Fortescue's increased and annoying attend-

faded in the darkened room, and judged by the calmer
feelings of the morning. A sensation of intense le-
pression crept over Emmeline as she gazed, increasing
as she looked on the face of the sleeper, which, divested
of its unnatural bloom, looked so fearfully wan aud
haggard. Her beautiful hair lay in tangled masses on
her damp brow, and as Emmeline gently tried to re-
move it, Eleanor started and awoke.
 Is it already time to get up?'' she said, languidly,
and only half unloading her eyes; I feel as if I had
not slept at all. Am lI dreaming?'' she adde, starting
up, ``or have I slept in one place and woke in another

sense of guilt and pain; she tried to be cold, proud, re-
serrel, but it would not do, and she suddenly flung her
arms round her sister's neck, and burst into agonized
tears.

argued hopefully from it. Alas. the unwanted softening

Emmeline could not succeed in convincing her how
wrongly, how eruelly she had acted. Eleanor ould
persist that she was not in the least to blame, and that
poor Fitzclair's fearful end was only owing to his own
violent passions, in fact, that he must have been out of
his mind, and that, though it was certainly very dread-

often we find those parents who have been over-indus-
gent to childhood unusually harsh to the faults of
youth. Weak characters, also, when driven to anger,
are always more violent than firmer ones; and, certain,
Eleanor's continued haughtiness and coldness, as if she
were the injured one, did not tend to calm him.

And his angry feelings were unfortunately but too
soon aggravated by a proposal in form from Captain
Fortescue for the hand of Eleanor. without a mo-
ment's delay, he despatched a decided and almost
insulting refusal to the young soldier, and then sought
his daughter, and vented on her the anger and vex-
ation which overpowered him, upgrading her not only
with the death of Fitzclair, but for having dared so to
encourage young Fortescue as to give him courage
for his audacious proposal. To his astonishment,
he was heard without any attempt at reply; but he
would have been startled, could he have seen the pallid
cheek, compressed lip, and clenched hand with which,
when he had left her, Eleanor mutterced-

Nearly three weeks rolled on, and Eleanor's ex-
extraordinary submission, and even in some degree
withdrawal from society (for which MIrs. Hamilton's
arrival was a good excuse), caused her father's irritation
against her almost entirely to subside. That she
passed several hours each day apart from her sister

her change of deportment, but nothing confidential

was nothing in the note to excite the read that
weighed on MIrs. HAmilton's spirits, as Eleanor care-
lessly threw it to her for her perusal, but she would
not express it, as Lord Delmont seemed inclined that
Eleanor should accept it, knowing that the lady was
much too exclusive for Captain Fortescue to join hen
guests, and believing that Eleanor's apparent india-
ference to the visit originated from that cause. Telling
her, he was so gratified by her having devoted so many
evenings to her sister, he added, she had his full con-
sent to go if she liked, as he could better spare her

quietly thanked him, but evidenced particular pleasure.
The day before her intended departure, the sisters
were sitting together, and little Perey, who now ran
firmly without any falls, was playing about the room.
He had already displayed a high spirit and passionate
temper, with their general accompaniment, self-will,
even in trifles, that MIrs. hAmilton felt would render
her task a trying one; but she was no firm as she

Though Eleanor had been his favorite, his feelings
of pride and hope had greatly centred in his son, whose
career in five years' active service on board a man-of-
war, had been such as to raise him already to a lieute-

in childhood,--and the visits which Charles had been

could be no more doubt that death or slavery-that fear-
ful slavery which the bombardment of Algiers had so
displayed to eUropean eyes-was the portion of all those
beloved ones, for whom so many aching hearts and eyes
ha watched and went in vain. It was a trial so terrible,
that MIrs. Hamilton felt at first as even submission and
departed from her; and she could almost have rebelled
in spirit against the inscrutable decree, that had con-
signed one so free from ice and oil, so full of happiness
and worth, to a doom so terrible. MUch as she had
loved and referenced her husband before, she seemed
need to have felt is worth and tenderness till then.
It as his sympathy, his strength, that recalled her to

a realization once more of the submissiseness to a

time, though it softened the first anguish, had no power

daily joys of a loving wife and devoted mother, that her
prayer was her rising for guidance, and gratitude, that
prosperity might not unfit her for the dark days of trial
and adversity, when they should come. That she had

intensely anxious to bring up her children with ore

nature to Miss HArcourt's individual feelings compelled

knew, as a single woman, as her sole source of index-

Harcourt found, levels, the friend her aching spirit

repose which she had insisted should forestall the com-

fiction that the daughter of her beloved and regretted
friend was indeed well-fitted for that position in her
family, her helper in the moral and intellectual training
of cr daughters, which her iid fanny had often pic-
turcd as so filled. They were indeed hut infants when
Miss Harcourt arrived; but Mr. and MIrs. HAmilton
found means to overrule the honorable scruples which,
on the part of Lucy, seemed at first against their plan,
and in her gradually returning health and peace, MIrs.
hAmilton not only rejoiced but felt gratefully thankful
that the wish of so many years' standing, anl which had

astonishing how often, if an earnest heartfelt desire for

impossibility, its accomplishment is at length obtained.
It is supposed to be only one so in books, but this is a
mistaken supposition, arising from the simple fact of
individuals so often forgetting their own past, and
failing steadily to pursue one object, regardless of the

That Eleanor could realize true happiness in a

the torture of her own thoughts, and her constant
dread of the world's contumely, as not likely. At
first, indeed, it was a very delightful thing to find
herself the object, not only of devotion to her husband
(whom, could she entire hae forgotten Fitzclair, she
might have really loved), but a still more brilliant star
in India than she had even been in england. Though

in the greater attention he received for her sak, com-

soldier's wife, he ha fondly believed she would possess.
But as his health, always delicate, became more and
more undermined, and compelled him to relinquish
society, at least in a great measure, and to look for
the quiet pleasures of domestic life, he found, and
bitter was that first awakening, that his wishes, hie
comfort, were of no importance. She could not resign
the pleasures of society-of still being enabled to pur-

just as he liked, and if he did not care to see her
surrounded, as she knew she was, by red coats, she
ould dismiss them all, and devote herself to him-
but indeed she could not stay at home,-he would feel
that it would be cruel indeed to chain such a being
to his side, and sometimes make the exertion (for
which he was little fitted) to accompany her; at others,
with kind words and indulgent loe, permit her to
follow her own wishes, and remain alone. But little
is he think the real reason that Eleanor could not rest
in quiet at home. The recollection of Lord itzelasir
was at such times s fearfully vivid, that the very age
she had endure when first told of his fearful end
would return in all its intensity; the thought, had
her father really cursed her for her disobedience, and
was it that for ever hovering round her, preventing
anything like lasting happiness. And yet, by a strange
contradiction, while the idea of her father's curse
shook her whole free at times with convrulsie
sobs, pride, that most fatal ingredient of her cha-
rate, utterly presented all attempt on her part to
communicate with her relations. She said, as they
had made no effort to conciliate, she would not;
and yet the longing for Emmeline sometimes became
actually painful.
Eleanor was never intended for the heartless, reckless
being she had tried to become. It was a constant
and most terrible struggle between the good and evil
parts of her nature, and though the evil triumphed-
in the determination that nothing should change her
course of action, nothing compel her to acknowledge
she had her even in the wrong, and was really not

obsequious, adopted the same opinion; and, before she
was seen three years old, harshness, both by use and
mother, had been constantly used, to make Ellen as
good a child as her brother.
In in did the Colonel, when he became aware of
this treatment, remonstrate that it as the illness of
the poor child,-neither obstinacy nor ill-temper: his
wife would not understand him, and at length he
sternly and peremptorily declared, that as she had her
will with Edward, he wold hse his with Ellen, and
that no cehastisement should be inflicted. If she is
wRong, he was to be told of it, and if necessary he
would prove her, but he would allow no other in-
reference. MIrs. Fortescue made not the least object-
tion, claiming that as her husband had thus taken
her in charge, she was exonerated from all blame if
she left her entirely to him.
Only too quickly did the poor child discover that
the lovely being whom she called mother, and whom
she loved so fondly, had no loe, no cares, for her.
Cemented punishment, though it had only extended
to her fifth year, had completely crushed the gentle
tender spirit, that had required such judicious nursing;
and combined with physical suffering, instead of denden-

done, had rendered them morbidly acute-an fleet

her, though his heart often ball as he did so, (for
what claim had her mother upon the feelings he sought
to inculcate,) to love, honour, and they her mother
in all things; that if she did so, she would be as
happy as Edward in time, and Ellen, though she did
not understand him, obeyed; but Colonel ortescue
little imagined the evil which was accruing from these
very natural lessons.
Ellen leaked to believe that as her mother neer
noticed her, except in accents of anger or irritation,
it must be her own fault. She longed to be beautiful
and buoyant as Edward; and that she was neither,
markel her in her own young mind as so inferior,
it was no wonder her mother could not cares or love
her. IPad Edward presumed on his favoritism, and
been unkind or negleetful, she might perhaps have
ensued more than she loved him; but his disposition
was naturally so noble, so open-hearted, so generous,
that he always treated her with affection, and would
share with her his playthings and sweets, even while
he could not but believe her in all things his inferior;
and that as such, of course, her wishes could never
cross with his,-poor child, she scarcely knew what
it was to wish, except that she might cling to her
mother as she did to her father, and that she could but
be good and beautiful enough to win her joel The
lesson of concealment of every feeling is hut too easily
nd too early learned. Tears do not flow even from
childhood, when always rudely checked and angrily
reported. Affection cannot display itself unless called
forth, and so the very onwards seeming of children

observers may believe: and MIrs. Fortescue blamed
and disliked the cold inanimate exterior which she
has never tried to warm.
ELlen's extreme difficulty in acquiring knowledge,
compared with Edward's extraordinary quickness, only
confirmed her painful conviction of her great inferiority,
the impossibility of her ever winning love,-and the
consequent increased intensity of her affection for her
father and brother, who loved her notwithstanding.
That the child herself could not have dehned these
sensations is true; but that they had existence,
even before she was nine years old, and that they
influence many years of her after-life, causing error
and suffering, and rendering Mrs. HAmilton's task
one of pain and difficulty, before these mistaken in-
fluences could be eradicated, is equally so. The power
or early years is so immense, its responsibility sa
extensive, that its neglect or abuse may indeed make
the earnest thinker tremble ; less, perhaps, for the
actual amount of general oil, for that circumstances
in after life are sometimes graciously permitted to
avert, but for individual suffering and individual joy,-
and especially is this the case in the training of girls.
More enduring in their very fragility than boys, they
may be compared to those precious' metals which
fire and water and pressure hae o power to break,
but simply to draw out to a thinner and thinner
thread, dwindling more and more, but to its last spider-
woven fitness capable of tenuity and vitality. While

her duty to take care of herself. It might be nothing
to the Colonel or Ellen whether sle fired or dial, but
to Elward it was a great deal; and so as she must
choose between them, she would go with him who loved
her best, and who would be miserable without hcr. The
haughty angry tone with which she spoke, the unjust
taunt, roused every indignant feeling, and Colonel
Forteseue said more in that moment of irritation than
he could have believed possible. But it only awakened
the cold sustaining pride which Eleanor always called
to her aid when conscience some her, and she departed

He had never been a religious man-never known

planted a sense of a Father's infinite loe and infinite
compassion within him, which was his sole sustainer

refining that she was left alone to suffer, could rejoice
that her brother had been spared.
Colonel kortescue obtained a few weeks' leave, that
he might take his child to the sea-side as recommended,
ere she joined her mother. And alone with him,
gradually regaining a moderate degree of strength,
Ellen was very happy; but such bright intervals were
indeed few and far between. There was no change

ller heart had, indeed, risen to her lips as she again
heheld the child so nearly lost; and had she followed

to acknowledge that she had been wrong, al had

chose to remember that it was Ellen who had been the
cause of her husband's anger-Ellen, the constant
subject of contention between them-Ellen, always
causing the pang of self-reproach: and so how as
it possible that she could love her?

affection for his wife had returned with such force as
to make him shrink in unusual suffering from the idea
of leaving her; and conquering reluctance, for he felt
as if she would not accede, he implored her to accom-

marble floor.
That same afternoon Colonel Forteseue, with some
picked men, has set off to discover the track of some
marauding natives, who for some days had been on-
served hovering about the neighbourhood. Military
harbour carried him farther than he intended, and it
was nearly night, when entering a narrow defile, a
large body of the enemy burst upon them, and a des-
perate contest ensued. The lefile was so hemmed in
with rock and mountain, that though not very distant
from the fort, the noise of the engagement had not
been distinguished. Captain Cameron was quietly sitting
with his wife and elder children, awaiting without any
Iorebodings the return of to Colonel. Though it was
late, Ellen's fears had been so visible, that MIrs. Cameron
could not send her to bed; the child seemed so rest-
lcss and uneasy that the Captain had trial to lugh her
out of cr cowardice, as he called it, declaring that her
father would disown her if slc could not be more rare.
Hasty footsteps were at length herd approaching, and
Ellen started from her seat and sprung forwards, as the
door openly; but it was not the Colonel, only a sergeant
who had necompanicl him, and whose face caused
Captain Cameron to exclaim, in alarm, `` IIow now,

The Captain started from his chair, but before he
could free another word, Ellen had caught hold of
the old man's arm, and wildly exclaimed, Do you

-Hare the Natives met apa's troop, and hate they
fought ?-and-is he hurt-is he killed? The man
could not answer her-for her look and tone, he after-
wards declared to his comrades, went through his heart,
just for all the world like a sabre cut; and for the
moment neither Captain nor MIrs. Cameron could address
her. The shock seemed to have banished voice from
all, one from the poor child principally concerned.
 Stay with me, a dear Ellen1'' MIrs. Cameron at
length said, balancing to her, as she still stool clinging
to the sergeant's arm; ``the Captain will go and meet
your father, and if he be wounded, we will nurse him

broken by the convulsel and passionate sobs of the
poor child, who flinging herself beside him, besought
him only to open his eyes, to look on her once more, to
call her his darling, and kiss her one, only once again:

Forteseue hadl stood transfixed by some unkown terror,

It was long before Allen rallied from that terrible
scene. Even when the fever which followed subsided,
and she had been taken, apparently perfectly restored
to health, one more to her mother and brother, its
recollection so haunted her, that her many lonely hours
became fraught with intense suffering. Her imagination,
already only too morbid, dwelt again and again upon
the minutest particular of that field of horror: not only
her father, but the objects which, when her whole heart
was wrapped in him, she seemed not even to have seen.
The ghastly eaps of dead, the several limbs, tue mangled
trunks, the gleaming faces all fixed in the distorted
expressions with which they died-the very hollow
groans anl louder cry of pain which, as she passed
through the field, had fallen on her ear unheeel,
returned to the poor child's too carly awakened fancy so
vividly, that often and often it was only a powerful though
almost unconscious effort that prevented the scream
of fear. Her father's last words were never forgotten;
she wouldn only continue to love her mother because
he had desire her to do so, but because He had so loved

So torturing were MIrs. Fortescue's feelings when she
recalled the last request of her husband, and her cruel
and haughty refusal; when that which has seemed so
important, a juvenile ball-because not to go would
disappoint Edward-became associated with his fearful
death, and sunk into worse than nothing,-she had parted
with him in anger, and it proved for ever ;-that een

quit it, and return to the relatives she hal neglected so

Though incapable of real loe, from her studie

twelve years with one so indulgent and found as Colonel
Fortescue, without realizing some degree of affection,

astonished at herself, and in her misery believed that

passage for England some weeks before her medical
attendant though it disable. The constant struggle
bcteen the whispering of good and the dominion of
evil, which her whole life had been, had unconsciously
undermined a constitution naturally good; and when to
this was added a malignant disease, though brief in
itself, the seeds of a mortal complaint were planted,
which, are the long voyage was concluded, had obtained
fatal and irremediable ascendeney, and oceasioned those
sufferings and death which in our first chapters we
described.
To Award, though the death of his father had caused

perfect consciousness of his on heavy loss, the manner
in which he did was to him a source of actual pride.

imagined not all the attendant horrors of such one;
and how that Ellen would never even hear the word

she should always so painfully shrink from the remotest
reference to that night, which was only associated in
his mind with emotions of pleasure. In the tedious
voyage of nearly six months (for five and twenty years

Captain Cameron had impressed on his mind that he
now stood in his father's place to his mother and sister;
and as the idea of protecting is always a strong incentive
to manliness in a boy, however youthful, Edward well
redeemed the charge, so devoting himself not only to his
mother, but to Ellen, that her affection for him redoubled,
as did her mistaken idea of his last superiority.
IIis taste had always pointed to the nfl in pre-

CHAPTER I
UUTIIEUL COLLOLYT-ITCHING CHARACTER.
TE curtains were drawn close, the large lamp was
on the table, and a cheerful fire blazing in the rate;
for though only September, the room was sufficiently
large, and the evenings succinctly chill, for a fire
to add greatly to its aspect of true English comfort.
There were many admirable pictures suspended on the
walls, and well-lille bookcases, desks, and maps, stands
of beautiful flowers, and some ingenious toys, all
seeming to proclaim the apartment as the especial
possession of the long party who were this evening
busily engaged at the large round table which occupied
the centre of the room. The were only four in
number, but what with a large desk pixel with books
and some most alarming-sized dictionaries, which oe-
piel the elder of the two lads, the embroidery frame
of the elder girl, the dissected map before her sister,
and two or three books scattered round the younger
boy, the table seemed so well filled, that Miss Harcourt
had quietly ensconced herself in her own private little
corner, sufficiently near to take an interest, and some-
times join in the conversation of her youthful charge:
but so apart as to the no restraint upon them, and to
enable her to pursue her own occupation of either
reading, writing, or working uninterrupted.-Could

she certainly might have told her sister, with some
show of justice, that there was such an equal district-
tion of interesting and animated expression (which is the
great beauty of youth), that she could not have known
the trial of having such a heavy, dull, unhappy child
as Ellen. MIrs. HAmilton indeed, we rather think would
not have considered such a trial, except as it proved
ill-health, and physical pain in the little suferer; and,
perhaps, her increased care and tenderness (for such
with her would have been the consequence of the
same cause which had created her sister's neglect)
might have removed both the expression of constant
but imalpable illness, and the expression of heaviness
and gloom. Certain it is, her own HErbert had, with
regard to delicate health, given her more real and con-
stant anxiety than Eleanor had eer allowed herself to
experience with Ellen; but there was nothing in the
boy's peculiarly interesting countenance to denote the
physical suffering he very often endured. Care and
love had so surrounded his path with blessings, that.
he was often heard to declare, that he never even
wished to be as strong as his brother, or to share his
nctie pleasures, he hl so many others equally de-
rightful. Whether it was is physical temperament,
inducing a latitude of reflection and studious thought
much beyond his years, or whether the unusually gifted
mind worked on this frame, or the one combined to form
the other, it would be as impossible to decide with
regard to him as with hundreds of others like him;
but he certainly seemed, not only to his parents, but
to their whole household, and to every one who

casually associated with him, to have more in him
of even than earth; as if, indeed, he were only lent,
not given. And often, and often his mother's heart
acted with its very intensity of loe, causing the
unspoken dread-how might she hope to retain one
so faultless, and yet so full of every human sympathy
and joel The delicate complexion, beautiful colour
of his cheeks and lips, and large, soft, very lark
blue eye, with its long black lash, high arched brow,
shaded by glossy cheanut hair, were all so it up with
the rays of mind, that though his face returned again
and again to the fancy of those who had only once
belheld it, they could scarcely have recalled a single
feature, feeling only the almost angelic expression of
the whole.
His brother, as full of birth and mischief, and as
noisy and laughter-loving as Herbert was quiet and
thoughtful, made his way at once, winning regar by
storm, and retaining it by his frank and generous
qualities, which made him as favorite with young and
old. Even in his hours of study, there was not the
least evidence of reflection or soberness. As a child
he had had much to contend with, in the way of pas-
sion, pride, and self-will; but his home influence has
been such a judicious blending of indulgence and firm-
ness on the part of both his parents, such a persevering
circulation of a strong sense of duty, religious and
moral, that at fifteen his difficulties had been all nearly
overcome; and except when occasional acts of thought-
lessons and hasty impulse lured him into error and
its painful consequences, he was a happy and as good
a law as ecn his anxious mother could desire

The elder of his two sisters resembled him in the
bright dark flashing eye, the straight intellectual brow,
the rich dark brown hair, and well-formed mouth;

it was often difficult to trace the likeness that actually
existed. IIaugltiness, and but too often ill-temper,
throw  shade over a countenance, which when happy
and animated was not only attractive then, but gae
fair promise of great bcanty in after years. Te his-
position of Caroline Hamilton was in fact naturally
so similar to that of her aunt MIrs. Fortescue, that
Mrs. Hamilton's task with her was not only more
difficult and painful in the present, than with any of
the others, but her dream of the future, at times so
overpowering that it required all her husband's influence
to calm her, by returning trust in Him, who had pro-
mixed to answer all who called upon Ilim, and would
bless that mother's tools which were based on, and
looked up alone, to Isis influence on her child, and
guidance for herself.
The blue-eyed, fair-haired, graceful, little Emmeline,
not only the youngest of the family, but, from her slight
figure, delicate small features, and childish manner,
appearing een much younger than she was, was indeed
a source of joy and love to all, seeming ns if sorrow,
except for others, could not approach her. She had
indeed much the required a carefully guiding han,

learning, an unrestrained fancy, and its general accom-

enough. MIrs. Hamilton had little fears for her, except
indeed as for the vast capability of individual suffering
which such a disposition engendered, in those trials
which it was scarcely possible she might hope to pass
through life without. There was only one safeguard,
one unfailing comfort, for a character like her, and
that was a deep ever-present sense of religion, which

her parents endeavoured to instil. Greatly, indeed,
would both MIr. and Mrs. Hamilton have been auto-
wished, had they been told, that the little girl Ellen
Fortescue, who to both was such an enigma, and who
was seemingly in all things so utterly unlike their
Emmeline, was in natural disposition exactly the same
and that the vast difference in present and future
character, simply arose from the fact, that the early
influences of the one were sorrow and neglect, and of
the other, happiness and love.

the unrestrained expressions of affection, with which
by every one of the young party they were received,
would have evinced it still more clearly. HErbert was
very speeding on his favorite scat, a low stool at his
mother's feet. Emmeline, for that one half hour at
least, assumed her still resigned privilege, as the
youngest and tiniest, to quietly slip in her lap; Percy
was talking to his father, making Edward perfectly at
home, saying many kind words to Ellen, nd caressing
is mother, all almost at the same moment. Caroline
was close to her father, with her arm round his neck;
and MIss HArcourt was kindly disturbing Ellen from her
many wraps, and making hcr lie quietly on a sofa near
her aunt; who, even in that moment of delighted re-
union with her own, had yet time and bought, by a
few judicious words, to remove the undefinable but
painful sensation of loneliness which was creeping
over the poor child as she gazed on her bright, lap-
looking cousins; and thought if to her own mother

were the thoughts that filled her eyes with tears, and
made her heart so easy; she only knew that much
as she had loved her aunt during the journey, her kiss
and kind words at that moment made her loe or
more than ever.
Never had there been a happier meal at Norwood
than the substantial tea which was speedily ready for
the travellers. So much was there to hear and tell;
Percy's wild allies; Caroline'as animated replies (she
had now quite recovered her temper); Herbert's gentle
care of Ellen, by whom he had stationed himself (even
giving up to her his usual seat by his mother),
Emmeline's half shy, half enter., efforts to talk to her
cousin; Mr. and Mrs. HAmilton's earnest interest,
all combined, long before the meal was concluded, to
make Award feel perfectly at lis ease, and very happy,
and greatly to remove Ellen's unacknowlelged dread.
The time passed so quickly, that there was a general
start when the prayer hell sounded, though it was
nearly two hours after the usual time.

it was so incomprehensible the servants all joining
them, a class of people whom in India he had been
1taught so to consider his inferiors, that even to speak
with them was a species of degradation; and he was
destined to be still more surprised, for before they left
the library, he heard his aunt and uncle address them
all, and say a fe kind words, and make inquiries after
their families, to cash.

A very short time sufficed for Perey and Emmeline
to introduce their cousins to all the delights and
mysteries of their year old home: and Norwood Ilall
was really a place for imagination to revel in. It was
a large castellated mansion, fraught with both the
associations of the past, and the comforts of the pre-
sent. The injuries which the original mansion had
received during the civil war of Charles I, had, when
the family returned at the Restoration, caused much of
the old house to be pulled down, and replaced with
larger rooms, and greater convenience for a modern
dwelling-louse, retaining, however, quite sufficient of
the past to throw interest around it.
The wings were still flanked with turrets, which ere

cases, leading into all sorts of books and covers,
-and the small and most uncomfortable roos, be-
cause some of them happened to be hung with tapestry,
and had those small narrow windows sunk in deep
recesses,-were pronounced by both far more enjoyable
than the beautiful suite of rooms forming the centre of
the mansion, and the selling of the family. Tales
were only saved from being diaagreeably modern-Percy
would declare-by their beautiful richly-polished taken
panels, and by the recesses which the large windows

brod carved taken balustrade, leading to a gallery
above, which opened on the general sleeping apart-
ments, and thus permitting the full height of the
mansion, from base to roof, to be visible from the
hall. The doors visible in the gallery opened mostly
on dressing-rooms, or private sitting-rooms, which led
to the large airy sleeping-rooms, to which the servants
hal access by back stairenses leading from their hall;
and so leaving the taken staircase and gallery entirely
to the use of the family, and of many s game of noisy
play had that gallery been the scene. There had been
a beautiful little chapel adjoining the mansion, but it
was mercilessly burnt to the ground by the infatuated
Puritans, and never restored; the venerable old
church of the village henceforth serving the family of
the Ill.
Situated on the banks of the Dart, whose serpentine
windings gae it the appearance of a succession of
most lovely lakes, Nature had been so lavish of her
beauties in the garden and park, especially in the mag-
nificent growth of the superb oaks, from which the
estate took its name, that it was not much wonder
MIrs. HAmilton, always an intense lover of Nature, should
ve become so attached to her home as never to feel
the least inclination to leave it. Shoe did not wish her
girls to visit London till a few months before Caroline
was old enough to be introduced, to gie them then
finishing masters; and to that time she of course
always looked, as demanding from her part of the year

teresa; and many acquaintances who would have visited
more than she felt any inclination for, had she not had
the happ power of quietly pursuing her own path, and
yet conciliating all.
The le, William HOward had accepted Mr. HAmilton's
eagerly-proffered invitation to become his rector, and
undertake the education of his boys, from very peculiar
circumstances. IIe had been minister of a favorite
church in one of the southern towns, and master of an
establishment for youths of high rank, in both which
capacities he had given universal satisfaction. The
reprehensible conduct of some of is pupils, carried on
at first so secretly as to elude his knowledge, at length
became so notorious as to demand examination. He
had at first refused all credence, but when proved, by
the confused replies of all, and alf confession of some,
he briefly and emphatically laid before them the enormity
of their conduct, and declared, that as confidence was
entirely broken between them, he would resign the
honour of their education, refusing to admit them any
longer as members of his establishment. In vain the
young men implored him to spare them the disgrace of
such expulsion; he was inexorable.
This conduct, in itself so upright, vas painted by the
smarting offenders in such colours, that MIr. FOrward
gradually but surely found his school abandoned, and
himself so misrepresented, that a spirit less self-pos-
sensed and secure in its own integrity must have sunk
beneath it. But he had some true friends and none
more active and earnest than MIr. HAmilton. A very
brief residence at Atwood Rectory removed even the
recollection of the injustice he had experienced, and he

of trial came, weakness and false indulgence so prado-
minute, that Grahame, to counteract these oil influx-
eyes, adopted a contrary extreme, and, by a system of
constant reserve and security, became an object of as
much terror to his children as he was to his wife. bUt
he did not pursue this conduct without pai, and never
did he visit Norwood without bitter regret that his
home was not the same.
MIr. anl MIrs. HAmilton had often tried to alter the
aspect of affairs at MIoorlands,-the former, by entreat
ing Grahame to be less severe; the latter, by urging
Lady HElen to a firmer made of conduct, But those
friendly efforts were as yet entirely useless. Grahame
became a member of Parliament, which took his family
to London for five or six months in the year-a particu-
early agreeable change to Lady Helen, who then associated
with her sisters, whose families were conducted much
on the same fashion as her own, but unfortunately
only increasing the discomfort of MIoorlands when they
returned to it. And this was the more to be regretted,
from the act that both Grnhame and his wife were full
of good intentions, and had the one been more yield-
in, and the other more firm, there might have been no
small share of happiness for bath.
But heavy as Lady Ilelen thought her trial in the
want of her husband's confidence and love, and which
she had greatly brought upon herself, it was light in com-
prison with that of Mrs. Grille, another near neigh-
hour and aluel friend of MIrs. HAmilton. he had

both her children, and still more forcibly, when they
became old enough to observe, by example than by pre-

hopelessness as to the fruit of her anxious labours, had
she not possessed that clinging, single-hearted trust
which taught her that no difficulty should deter from a
simple duty, and that nothing as too hard for Him
who-if He saw that she shrunk not from the charge
and responsibility which, in permitting her to become
a mother, He had given, and did all she could to coun-
teracet those evil influences, for the removal of which she

THE part of the day which to Emmeliue Hamilton
was the happiest of all, was that in which she and
Caroline, and now, of course, Ellen, were with their
mother alone. Not that she particularly like the very
quiet employment of plain work, which was the third
usual occupation, but that she could talk without the
least restraint either about her lessons, or her measures,
or her thoughts, and the stories or histories se had
been reading, and if she thought wrong no one ever
corrected her so deligltfully and impressively as
 Mamma.'' The mornings, from three to four hours,
according as their age and studies required, were always
under the control of MIss Harcourt, with such visits
from MIrs. Hamilton as gave an increased interest to ex-
region, and such interruption only as permitted their
practice and lessons in sic, which three times a week

concluded at three. From hlf-past one to half-past

walking, or rising, and in the longer, to Emmeline's
favorite time-an hour at work with her mother, and

from five to six. From six to seen in the same gene-

for; their brothers having been employed for MIr
Howard part of the time between dinner and the, with
sufficient earnestness to enjoy the rest and recreation
afterwards, quite as buoyancy and gladly as their
sisters, and many a merry dnnee enlivened their winter
evenings.
In the summer, of course, this daily routine was
frequently varied by most delightful excursions in the
country. MIrs. Hamilton earnestly longing to implant
a love of Nature and all its fresh pure associations in
the minds of her children while yet young, knowing that
one obtained, the pleasures of the world would be far
less likely to obtain too powerful dominion. That which
the world often terms romance, she felt to be a high
pure sense of poetry in the Universe and in Man, which
she was quite as anxious to instil as many mothers to
root out. She did not believe that to cultivate the
spiritual needed the banishment of the matter of fact;
but she believed, that to infuse the latter with the former
world he their best and surcst preventive against all
that was low and mean; their best help in the realize-
tion of a constant unfailing piety. For the same reason
she cultivated a taste for the beautiful, not only in her
girls, hut in her boys-and beauty, not in arts and
Nature alone, but in character. She did not allude to

beauty of merely the igh anl striking kind, but to the
lowly virtues, struggles, faith, and heroism in the poor-
their forbearance and minutes to one another-marking
something to admire, teen in the most rugged and surly,
that a first sight would seem so little worthy of notice.
It was gradually and almost unconsciously, to accustom
her daughters to such a train of thought and sentiment,
that she so particularly laid aside one part of the way to
have them with her alone ; ostensibly, it was to give part
of their day to working for the many poor, to whom
gifts of ready-made clothing are sometimes much more
valuable than money ; but the education of that one hour
she knew might, for the right cultivation of the heart,
do more than the more teaching of five or six, and that
education, much as shelved and value MIss IIareourt,
she had from the first resolved should come from her
alone.
To Emmeline tis mole of life was so happy, she
could not imagine anything happier. But Caroline often
and often denied her great friend Annie Grahame, and
believed that occasional visits to London would make her
much happier, than remaining all the year round at
Norwood nd only with her own family. She knew
the expression of such sentiments would meet no syn-
path at home, and certainly not obtain their gratification,
so she tried to check them, except when in company
with Annie and any lIelen; but her mother knew them,
and from the discontent and unhappiness they so often
engendered in hcr child, caused her both pain and
Uneasiness. Lut sle did not waver in her plans, because

done, check Carolina's association with MIss Grahame.
She knew that those principles must be indeed of little
worth, which would only aetuate in retirement, and when
tree from temptation. That to prevent intimacy with
all, except with those of whom she exactly approved,
would be impossible, if she eer meant her daughters to
enter the world; and therefore she endeavourcd so to
obtain their unrestrained confidence and affection, as to
be regarded both now, and when they were young
women as their first, best, and truest friend, and that
end obtained, intricacies with their young companions,
however varied their character, she felt would do na
permanent harm.
 Car, dear ANnual'' exclaimed Emmeline, one
morning about a week after her parents' return, and
dropping er work to speak more eagerly, ``you cannot
think how delightful it does seem to have you at home
again; I missed this out of the by so very much; i
did not know how much I locked when I always had it,
but when you were away, every time the hour came I
missed out, and longed for you so much the-i am
afraid of ill think me very silly-I could not help
crying.''
 Wh, how Percy must have laughed at you, Emmy.''
Indeed, he did not, Mamma; 1 think he felt half
inclined to cry to, the first day or to that he came
home from 3Ir. Howard's, and could not rush up in
you dressing-room, as e always does. lIe said it was
a very different thing for you to go from home, than for

Herbert, nor Caroline, neither; though they did not as
so much about it.

I did not miss hIamma after the first, quite so much
as you did, Emmeline,'' replied her sister, ingenuously;
``because when Lady Helen returned from London, she
made me go there so often, and as I know you never
refuse to that indulgence, MIamma, and Miss HArcourt
did not object, I was glad to do so.''
I have only one objection, my dear Caroline, and I
think you know what that is.''
That whenever I am with Annie I think and with
more about going to London, MIamma, I am afraid 1
do; but indeed I try to think that you must know what
is better for me, and try not to be discontented, though
sometimes I know I do not succeed,'' and her eyes filled
with tears.
I am satisfied that you endeavour to trust my
experience, my love; I am quite aware of all the diffie.
culture you have to encounter in doing so, and therefore
your most trifling conquest of self is a great source of
comfort to me. I myself should feel that the pain of
increased discontent, and so of course increased diff-
cult in conquering its constant accompaniment, ill
temper, would more than balance the pleasure of Annie's
society, and so not indulge in the one so often at the
expense of the other; but of that you are yourself the
best judge, and you know in such a case l always permit
you to be a free agent. 3ut what has become of Mary,
Emmeline ? I begged MIrs. Greville toilet you e as much
together as possible luring y absence; did not her
society afford you some pleasure?'
 Oh, yes, MIamma, a great deal; but unfortunately
MIr. Greville was at home almost all the time you were
away, and poor Mary could not often lente her rother,

129
and I don't feel as if it were quite right for me to go so
often there, when he is at home. I am sure MIrs,
Greville and Mary must both feel still more comfort-
able when any one is there to see how unkind he is, and
hear the cruel things he says. Oh, low I do wish 1
could make poor Mary more happy.''
 She would tell you that affection is a great comfort
to her, LEnny.''
 Yours and Herbert's may be, Mamma, because you
are both so much better and wiser than I am; but I can
do so little, so very little.''
 You can be and are a great source of interest to her,
my dear; and when we wish very much to make another
person happ, you may be quite sure that the most
trifling act gives pleasure; but Ellen looks very much
as if she would like to know who this MAry is, that is so
tried-suppose you tell her.''
Emmeline eagerly obeyed, painting her friend in suel
going colours, that Ellen felt, however trie height
bce, a person so good and holy just be happy norwich-
standing; besides, to be loved so by MIrs, HAmilton and
Gilbert, discovered to her mind such superior qualities,
that she almost wondered how Emmeline could speak of
her so familiarly, and think of her as her own particular
friend. But the conversation on her and tlc on other
topics so interested her, that she was host as sory as
her cousin, when it was interrupted by a visit from Lady
Hlen Grahame and her daughter.

I rather think the change of season, and not my

replied MIrs. HAmilton, in the same tone; 'but even
London will not change your kind thought for me,
Helen.''
Nay, I must follow the example of my neighonrs,
rich and poor, whom you may appeal to as to the fact
of your absence causing terrible lamentation; ask this
naughty little girl too, who scarcely ever came to see

sole notice of eLlen, who had come widely forward, was
a haughty stre, a fashionable curtsey, and a few

Ellen might have found courage to reply, for there
was an interest attached to all who had known her
mother; but as she raised her eyes to speak, she again
encountered Annie's rude and disagreeable state, and
the world died on her lips. The young party were,
however, soon all in the garden, for Mrs. Hamilton
never made any scruple in dismissing her children,
when she wished to speak on subjects she did not
choose them to her; and she was anxious so to relate
Eleanor's illness and change of sentiment, as to remove
the impressions which her early career had left on
Lady HElena's memory.

Annie Grahame was a few months younger the
Caroline Hamilton (who was nearly thirteen), but from
having been emancipated from the nursery and school-
room at a very early age, and made her mother's com-
anion and confidant in all her home vexations-very
pretty and engaging,-she was very much noticed, and
her visits to her titled relations in London, hy causing
her to imitate their fashionable manners, terms of
speech, thoughts on dress, and rank, kc., made her a
woman many years before her time; and though to Lady
Ileen's family and to Lay Helen herself this ade her
till more agreeable, from becoming so very companion-
able, to MIrs. HAmilton, and to all, in fact, who loved
childhood for childhood's sake it was a source of real
regret, as banishing all the restless and restlessness
and warmth which ought to have been the characteristics
of her age. Her father was the only one of her own
family who did not admire-and so tried to check-this
assumption of fine ladies, but it was not likely he
could succeed, and he only stronger from him the

Hamilton as her favorite friend. Why, she could not
exactly tell, except that it was so very delightful to have
some one in the country to whom she could dilate on
all the pleasures of London, display her new dresses,
new music, drawings, work, &c. (not however consider-
in it at all necessary to mention that her work and
drawings were only half her own, and Caroline was
much too truthful herself to imagine it, and her mother
too anxious to retain that guileless simplicity to cn-
lighten her, as she was well capable of doing). Annie's
quick eye discovered that at such times Caroline cer-
mainly enviel her, and she imagined she must be a
person of infinite consequence to excite such a feeling,
and this was such a pleasant sensation, that she sought
Caroline as much as possible during their stay at MInor-
lands. O MIrs. Hamilton, indeed, sle stood in such
comfortable awe, though that lady never addressed

tally became dislike; but this only increased her
intimacy with Caroline, whom she had determined
should be as unlike her mother as possible, and as this
friendship as the only one of his daughter's sentiments
which gae MIr. Grnhnme mixed satisfaction, he
encouraged it by bringing them together as often as he
could.

her brother a party in her indignation against Annie's

make her feel it. And as they came in sight of her

Annie was always particularly pleased when the hand-

and that he should be so devoted to his little pale dis-
agreeable-looking cousin, as not even to give her a word,
annoyed her quite as much as he desired.
Edward's hasty progress to his aunt was slightly
checked at seeing a stranger with her, but when he was
introduced, he made his bow with so much of his
mother's grave, that, combined with the extraordinary
likeness, and her feelings already interested in Mrs.
Hamilton's account of her sister's sufferings an death,
Lady SIlent could not for the moment speak, except to
exclaim, ` Oh, how that look recalls the past I could

A rEr lays more brought Irs. Grille and Mary
to welcome their friends, and Ellen had again the pain
of being introduced to strangers; but this time it was
only the pain of her own shyness, for could she have
overcome that feeling, she might have felt even pleasure.
As it was, the gentle voice and manner with which
MIrs. Grille addressed her, and the timid yet espres-
sive glance of Mary, told of such sympathy and kind-
ness, that she felt attracted towards both, and could
quite enter into Emmeline's enthusiastic admiration of
her friend; not, however, helping it possible that
she herself could ever be worthy to in Mary's regard.
Taught from such a very early age to believe herself so
far inferior to Edward, such characters as HErbert and
MAry appeared to her so exalted, that it was quite
impossible they could ever think of her; the constant
little acts of unobtrusive kindness that her cousin
showed her, she attributed to his extreme goodness, not
from the most trifling merit in herself. She did indeed
love him very dearly, the best nest to her aunt; but
so much of reverence mingled with it, that she was
almost more reserved with him than with the others.

Ten contrasting MAry Greville with Annie Grahame,
as she was rather for of doing, Lmmeline became so
afraid she was disliking the latter more than she ought
to do, that she near rested till she made an oppor-
unity to confess nll her feelings to her mother, and
be her to tell her if they were very wrong, and if she
ought to like her.
I am not so unconscionable as to expect you t
like every one with whom you associate, my dear little
girl,'' replied her mother, fondly, for there was some-
thing in Emmeline's guileless confidence irresistibly
claiming love.,  All we have to do when we find no-
thing that exactly sympathize with our own feelings,
or our own ideas of right and wrong, is to try and find
out some reason for their being so different; some
circumstance that may have exposed them to greater
temptations and trials, for you know I have often told
you pleasure and amusements, if too much indulged in,
are a much greater trial to some than sorrow and pain.
Now Annie has had a great many more temptations of this
kind than you or Mary, and we cannot expect one so
very oung entirely to resist them,''
Do you mean, MEdian, her going out so much in
London ?
Yes, love; she is very much noticed, and so perhaps
thinks a little too much of appearance and dress and
pleasure than is quite necessary.''
But Lady HElen need not take her out so much if
she did not like. Do you think she is quite right to do
so?'' asked Emmeline, very thoughtfully.

for I do not take you or Caroline to LOndon; but
Mr. Grahame is obliged to be there for several months,
and Lady Helen very naturally would not like to be
separated either from him or her children. And then
she has such a large family and Annie so many young
relations, that you see Lady HIclen could not keep her
children quite as free from temptation as I do mine,
and we should be more sorry for Annie than blame her
individually, howcer we may not like her faults.
Do you understand mc, my dear?''
Oh, yes, Mamma, and I am so glad I took courage
to tell you all I felt. I am afraid I have encouraged
many unkind thoughts about her, and I am quite sorry
ow, for I see she cannot help them as much as I
thought she could. I do not think I could ever make
her my friend, but I will try very much not to dislike

we might have been just the same; and this is the

this morning. Are you tired of listening tome, dearest,
or shall we read it over again together?''
Emmaline's only answer was to run eagerly for her
little Bible, and with gloviug cheeks and sparkling
eyes listen to her mother, as she turned to the fifteenth
Palm, and reading it through, particularly pointed out
the third verse, and so explained it, is easily and
happily to satisfy her child as to the Divine authority
for all that she had said, and to stamp them still more
forcibly on her memory.
`And now I do not mean to talk to you any more,
my darling,'' she said, kissing the little earnest face
upturned to hers.  You have heard quite enough to
think about, and I m sure you will not forget it, to
go and play; Ellen must be wondering what has be-

bounded away, exclaiming, as she lil so, `for Annie,

She was watching with delight Emmeline's un-

Tiny, as he chose to call her, was his especial pet and

and Caroline both looked up surprised, but a rapid sign
from MIrs. Hamilton presented their making any remark.
Herbert fled his eyes pityingly on his little cousin, as
if wishing but not liking to address her. Edward was
the only one of the party who moved. He was busily
engaged examining a large Noah's ark, and speculating
as to its resemblance to a ship and its powers of floating,
but after a few minutes' apparent thought he left it, and
sitting down on Ellen's chair, put his arm around her,
and begged her to find a picture of Noah's ark, and see
if it were at all like the toy. Cleared by his affection,
she conquered with a strong effort the choking in her
throat, and turned to the page, and tried to sypathise
in his wonder if it really were like the vessel in which
Goal was said, and where he could have put all the
animals. MIrs. HAmilton joined them, and without
taking more notice of Ellen's very pale cheeks and heavy
eyes, than gently to put back the thick tresses that
seemed to annoy her with their weight, gave them so
much interesting information on the subject, and so
delighted Erd with allowing him to rag down several

ut MIrs. HAmilton didnot forget the child's lincoln-
tary evidence of suffering, and mainly tried to imagine
what at that moment could have caused it. HErbert
seemed to think about it too, for the next day she heard
him ask Elwart-
If he knew why his sister always looked so sad?
if i thought it was because she was not yet reconciled
to Oakwoolt
It is not that,'' was Edward's reply: `she has a-
ways looked and seemed sad, as long as lUcan remember
er. One reason may be, she was always ill in India,
and Pnp was often telling me how very much she
learned, and how patiently she bore it; and then, too,
she knew I was poor lemma's favorite (his voice
trembled), and used to make her very unhappy ; but I do
not know why she is so very sad now, unless she is ill
again, and that no one can tell, for she never will
complain.''

Edward ith eager willingness communicated all he
new, though, from his being so continuity with his
mother, and Ellen so much left to her father and herself,
that all was little enough; adding, however, that after
her cry dangerous illness, when she was eight years
old, he perfectly well remembered hearing some cell-
bratel physician say to his father she would probably
feel the effects of it all her life.

`It was a very long time before MIamma permitted me
to see her,'' adde Edward, ``and when I did, I reem-
hcr being almost frightened, she was so altered, so pale,
and thin and weak; and tlc she was very ill after poor
Papa's death ; but since then she has never complained,
and never kept her bed; but I know she is often in
pain, for when I have touched her forehead sometimes,
it has burnt my hand like fire.'
THis childish explanation certainly told Mrs. HAmilton
more than she had known before; but that Ellen had
witnessed the fearful scene of her father's death was
still concealed. Early, as he grew older, though he
did not know why, seemed to shrink from the subject,

more learned and refined appellation of studio, it was

in angry impatience-

your idleness, llen, not the difficulty of your lesson;

reply. `` She is not idle, and I am sure her lesson is
not so easy; I wish I could explain it properly.''

of the whole system thence proceeding, which must
preset the liveliness and quickness of requirement

ill-temper not illness which rendered Ellen so disagree-
able, she would not stoop so to conquer her unfortunate
pride as to as such a four of her relatives, and to
whom else could she appeal ? Colonel Fortescue had
done but distant cousins. She did satisfy a qualm of
conscience by once suggesting to her husband-was her
own idea, however, not as that of an experienced ph-
sician-that as he fancied Ellen was always ill, she
might be better in England; but, as she expected, not
only his intense love for his little girl rose up against the
idea of separation, but his pride revolted from sending
her to claim the city of relatives who had so completely
cast off her parents: yet had he been told it was also-
lately necessary for her health and so greatly for her
happiness, he would not have hesitated to sacrifice every
thought of self. But Eleanor, satisfied that she had
done her duty, and delighted that in one respect he was
quite as proud as she was, never again referred to the
subject, and the physician who had thus advised, from
his constant remorals, he never chanced to meet.
Great indeed was the amount of childish suffering

of; they perhaps think it almost a pleasant change,
the care and petting and presents so often lavished on
a brief decided illness : but that is a very different thing
to that kind of suffering which only so affects them as to
be dull and heavy, they do not know who, and to make it
such a very difficult task to learn the lessons others find
so eas; anl such a pain sometimes to more, that they
are thought slow and unwilling, and perhaps even idle,
when they would gladly run, and help, and work as
others; and so weak sometimes, that tears start at the
first harsh or unkind work, and they are thought cross,
when they do not in the least feel so; and this not for
a few weeks, but with few exceptions, the trial of months
and even years.

required more patience and forbearance and care than

of such a remarkably-gifted mind, and so bright in
aspect, so sweet in temper, that illness seemed to
have spiritualized instead of detained every faculty.
She could not understand as MIrs. HAmilton did, the
force of circumstances in producing from nearly the
same cause two such different effects, nor how it was
that complete neglect had engendered more oils than
indiscreet indulgence: but that it appeared to have
done so, was happily only too evident not only to
Miss Harcourt but to MIrs. Hamilton. It seemed almost
surprising, and certainly a proof of a remarkably good
disposition, that Edward appeared so free from great
faults, and of such a warm, generous, frank, and see-
singly unselfish nature, so open to conviction, and to all
good impressions, that, except occasional fits of violent
passion, there really was, as far as his aunt and uncle
could perceive, nothing to complain of. They did not
know that he stood in such awe of MIr. HAmilton, from
his mother's lessons of his exceeding sternness, that
he exercised the greatest control over himself; and he
was so excessively fond of MIr. Howard, and his days
glided by in such varied and delightful employment,
that there was no temptation to do wrong; except certain
acts of trifling disobedience, of more consequence from
the self-will they betrayed than the acts themselves,
but which might have been sources of anxiety to his
aunt, and lessened her confidence in him had she known
them; but she did not, for allen not only constantly
concealed, but was the sufferer for him, and so brought
reproof and suspicion on herself, which, could the truth

of net as well as word had never been impressed on
Elward; and, therefore, though he was constitutionally
too brave to utter a falsehood, too honorable to shield
himself at the expense of another, if he knew that other
suffered, he had been too long taught to believe that
Ellen was his inferior, and must always give up to him,
to imagine that he was ever acting deccitfully or gunman-
fully in permitting her to conceal his acts of disobedience.
There was so much to love and admire in Edward,
that neither MIr. nor MIrs. hamilton imagined the real
weakness of his character-that those lovenble qualities
nll sprung from natural impulse, sustained by any-
thing like principle. The quickest and apparent for-
our with which he received the religious impressions

the short time that was allowed them before he entered
the navy, they augured so hopefully from, that not only
his receptor and uncle, but his ever anxious aunt, looked
forward to his career with scarcely a doubt as to its
profit and honour.
Ellen caused her infinitely more anxiety. There was
a disregard to truth, a want of openness and canlour,
which, though Mrs. HAmilton believed the detects of
neglect and extreme timidity, both her husband and Miss
IIareourt feared were natural MUch indeed sprung
from the poor child's mistaken idea of the nature and
solemnity of the promise she had made her the, and
her constant watchfulness and termination to shield
Edward. For the disregard to truth her other ad
indeed alone been answerable. Ellen's naturally very
timid character required the insulation of a high firm

principle, to enable her so to conquer herself is to speak
the truth, even if she suffered from it. It was only
indeed in extreme cases of fear-and never to her father
that she had ever spoken falsely; but to Mrs. HAmilton's
high principles, which by extreme diligence and care
she had as successfully imparted to her own children,
een concealment was often an acted untruth, and of
this fault and equivocation Ellen was but to often
guilty: exciting MIss Harcourt's and Caroline's prc-
juices yet more against her. The latter with all her
faults neer swerved from the rigid truth, and had a
strong contempt and dislike towards all those who did-
except her friend Annie, who, as she always took care to
speak the truth to her, she did not suspect of being less
careful than herself. Emmeline, who had had some diff-
cult in restraining her love of exaggeration, and also
in so conquering her own timidity and fear as always to
speak the truth, only pitie Ellen, but did not love her
the less.

137
A YULNG ETLIAN IN  P1SCION.-A WALl.-
A 8SCENE OF DI9THE3S.
OB very fine morning in May, Mrs, Hamilton invited
Award to join her in a walk, intending alao to call at
Moorlands and Greville MInor on their way. The
Ads were released for a few days from their attendance
on MIr. TOward, that gentleman having been sum-
money on some clerical business to eXeter. Percy as
to account his father on an equestrian excursion;
HErbert had been commissioned by Emmeline some
days before to take some books to MAry Greville, and
had looked forward himself to spending a morning with
her. Edward, delighted at being selected as his aunt's
companion, prepared with haste and glee for his court-
sion. Robert was, however, unfortunately not at hand
to give him a clean pair of shoes (he had already spoiled
two pair that morning by geiug into the stream which
ran through the park to sail a newly-rigged frigate),
and angry at the relay, fearing that his aunt would not
wait for him, he worked himself into such a violent pas-
sion, that when Robert did appear he gae went to more
abusive language than he had over yet ventured to use,
concluding by hurling both his discarded shoes at the
domestic, who only escaped a severe blow by starting
aside, an permitting them to go through the window.

 Robert, leave the room: I desire that you will not
again gie your assistance to MAster lortescue till he
knows how to as it,'' was MIrs. hAmilton's most
unexpected interference, and Elward so started at her
voice and look, that his passion was suddenly opened.
'Finish your toilette, and when you have found your
shoes and put them away, you May join me in the
breakfast-room, Edward. I only wait your pleasure,''
And eer lid Elward leave her presence more gladly.
Shame had suddenly conquered anger, and, though his
chest still heaved and his checks were still Rushed, he
did not utter another word till nearly a quarter of
mile on their walk. Twice he had looked up in his
aunt's face as if about to speak, but the expression as
so very grave, that he felt strangely afraid to proceed.
At length he exclaimed-
 Yo are displeased with me, dear Aunt; but indeed
I could not help feeling angry.''
I am still more sorry than displeased, Edward;
I had hoped you were learning more control, and to
know your duty to a domestic better. Your uncle-''
Oh, pray do not tell him'' implorel Edward, ``and
I1 will use Robert's pardon the moment I go home.''
I certainly shall not complain of you to him,
Wanted, if my arguments cau choice you of your
error; but if you are only to ask Robert's pardon for
fear of your uncle, I would rather you should not u
so. Tell me the truth; if you were quite sure you
uncle would know nothing about it, would you still ask
Robert's pardon?'
Edward unhesitatingly answered  N '
And why not?

159
 Because I think he ought to ask mine for keeping
me waiting as he did, and for being insolent first to
me.''
 HE did not keep you waiting above five minutes,
and that was my fault not his, as I was employing him;
and as for insolenee, cn you tell me what he said
Elward hesitate.
I do not remember the exact words, but I know he
called me impatient, and if I were, he had a right to
tell me so.''
Nor did he. I heard all that passed, and I could
not help thinking how very far superior was Robert, a
poor country youth, to the young gentleman who
abused him.''
Tho color rose to Edward's temples, but he set his
teeth and clenched his hand, to prevent any farther
display of anger; and his aunt, after attentiely ob-
serving him, continued-
 He said that his young master Perc never required
possibilities, and though often impatient never abused
him. You heard the word, and feeling you had been
so, released he applied it to yourself.''
 bUt in what can he be my superior?'' asked Elward,
in a low voice, as if still afraid his passion would regain
ascendeney.

for control. Neither equal nor superior should dare
speak so to me again.''
`And what prevented Robert acting in the same
manner? Do you think he has no feeling ?-that he
is incapable of such emotions as pain or anger ?''
Edward stood for a minute quite still and silent.
I did not think anything about it,'' he said at
length; ` but i certainly supposed I had a right to say
what I pleased to one so far beneath me,''
: And in what is robert so far beneath you ?''
 He is a servant and I am a gentleman; above him
in birth, rank-''
Stop, Edward did you make yourself a gentleman
Is it any credit to you individually to a higher in the
world, and receive a better education than Robert ?'
Elward was again silent, and his aunt continued to
talk to him so kindly yet so earnestly, that at length
he exclaimed-
I feel I have indeed been wrong, dear Aunt; but
what can I do to prove to Robert I am really sorry for
aviog treated him so ill ?'
 re you really sorry, Edward, or do you only say
this for fear of your uncle's displeasure ?''
 Single, I hal quite forgotten him,'' replied Edward,
earnestly; I desire his anger, and would willingly
expose myself to it, if it would redeem my fault,''
I would rather see you senator carnestly to
restrain your passions, my denr boy, than inflict any
such pain upon you. It will be a great pleasure to me
if you can really so conquer yourself as to apologise to

if you weakly shrink from it. The life you have chosen
makes me even more anxious that you should become
less passionate-than were you to remain longer with
me;-I fear you will so often suffer seriously from it.''
I1 very often make resolutions ever to be in a
passion again,'' returned Enroll, sorrowfully ; `` but
whenever anything provokes me, something seems to
me in my throat, and I am compelled to give way.''
yOu will not be able to conquer your full, my
dear Reward, without great perseverance; but remember,
the more difficult the task, the greater the reward; and
that you can control anger I have, been during our
walk, had a proof.''
Edward looked up surprised.
 Did you not feel very angry when I said Robert
as our superior ?'
Yes,'' replied Edward, blushiug deeply.
5' And yet you successfully checked your rising
passion, for fear of offending me. I cannot be always
near you; but, my dear to, you must endeavor to
remember that lesson I have tried to teach you so often
--that you are neer alone. You cannot even think as
angry thought, much less speak an abusive word and
commit the most trifling act of passion, without offending
Gol. If you would but ask for Isis help, and recollect
that to offend Him is far more terrible than to incur
the displeasure of either your uncle or myself, I think
you would find your tasl much easier, than if you
attempted it, trusting in your own strength alone, and
only for fear of man.''
Edward did not make any reply, but his countenance

pressed such earnest thought and softened feeling, that
MIrs. Hamilton determined on not interrupting it by
calling at MIoorlnds as she had intended, and so
turned in the direction of Grille MInor. They walked
on for some little time in silence, gradually ascending
one of those steep and narrow but green and flowery
lanes peculiar to Conspire; anton reaching the
summit of the hill, and passing a moment by the little
gate that opened on a rich meadow, through which their
path lay, an exclamation of  How beautiful'' burst
from Hard.
Fields of alternate red and green sloped down to the
river's edge, the green bearing the glistening colour
peculiar to MAy, the red from the full rich soil betraying
that the plough hal but lately been there, and both

all presented the exquisite variety of green peculiar to
May, and so lofty was the slope on which they grew,
that some seemed to touch the very sky, while others
bent gracefully over the water, which their thick
branches nearly method. The hills themselves pre-
rented a complete mosaic of red and green; the fields
divided by high hedges, from which the oak and cl and
eel and ash would start up, of growth so superb as
to have the semblance of a cultivated park, nut of

though lovely still, MIr. Grerille's excesses had already
shorn of some of their finest timber. Some parts of
the river were in complete shade from the overhanging
branches, while beyond them would stretch the bright
blue of heaven: in other parts, a stray tsunami would
dart through as opening in the thick branches, and
shine like s bright spot in the surrounding darkness;
and farther on, the cloudless sun so flag down his
full resurgence, that the moving waters flashed and
sparkle like burning gems
Is it not beautiful, dear Aunt? Sometimes I feel as
if I were not half so passionate in the open air as in
the house: can you tell me why ?''
Not exactly, Edward,'' she replied, smiling; but1
I am very pleased to hear you say so, and to find that
you can admire such a lovely scene as this, To my
feelings, the presence of a loving God is so impressed
upon his works; e can so distinctly trace goodness,
and love, and power, in the gift of such a beautiful world,
that I feel still more how wrong it is to indulge in
vexation, or care, or anxiety, when in the midst of
beautiful country, than when at home; and perhaps it is
something of the same feeling working in to, though
you do not know how to define it.''
 bUt you can never to or feel anything wrong, dear
Aunt,'' said Edward, looking with surprised inquiry in
her face.
Indeed, my dear boy, I know that I srery often hae
wrong thoughts and feelings; and that only my Father
in lleaen's infinite mercy enables me to overcome them.
It would be very sad, if I were as faulty, and as easily

led into error, as you and your cousins may be, when
I have had so many more years to think and try to
improve in; but just in the same way as you have
duties to perform and feelings to overcome, so have I;
and if I fail in the endeavour to lead you all in the
better and happier path-or feel too much anxiety, or
shrink from girig myself pain, when compelled to
correct a fault in either of you, I am just as likely to
incur the displeasure of our Other in Heaven as you
are when you are passionate or angry; and perhaps
still more so, for the more cable we are of knowing
and doing our duty, the more wrong we are when we
fail in it, ecn in thought.''
There was so much in this reply to surprise Edward,
it seemed so to fill his mind with new ideas, that he can-
tinted his walk in absolute silence. That his aunt could
ever fail as she seemed to say she had and did, and even
still at times found it difficult to do right, slavery strange;
but yet somehow it seemed to comfort him, and to inspire
him with a sort of courage to emulate her, and conquer
his difficulties. le had fancied, that she could not
possibly understand how difficult it was for him always
to be good; but when he found that she could do so
even from her own experience, her words appeared en-
lower with double force, and e loved her, and looked
up to her more than ever.

MIrs. Hamilton, somewhat anxiously, ad her anxiety
increased, as on nearing the half open door she saw poor
Mary, er head leaning against Gilbert, deluge in tears.
MIrs. Greville was not there, though the books, work,
and maps upon the table told of their morning's
employment having been the same as usual. Herbert
was ernestly endeavouring to speak comfort, but evi-
gently without success; and MAry was in general so
controlled, that her present grief betrayed some very
much leader trial than usual.
 Is your mother ill, my dear MAry? What ean has
happened to agitate you so painfully?'' she inquired
as at the first sound of her voice the poor girl sprung
towards her, and tried to say low very glad she
was that she had come just then; but the words were
articulated from sobs; and MIrs. HAmilton, desiring
Edward to amuse himself in the garden, made her sit
down by her, and told her not to attempt to check her
tears, but to let them have free vent a few minutes, and
then to trend tell her what had occurred. It was a
sad tale for a child to tell, and as MIrs. HAmilton's

happily near neighbours, permitted; and though
Alfred's cheek became pale, his eye hangar, and his
temper uncen, his initiation was fraught with such
new species of excitement and pleasure, that it rejoiced
and encouraged his father in the same measure as it
agonized his mother, and, for her sake, poor MAry.
That morning Alfred had declared his intention of
visiting a large fair, which, with some races of but ill
repute, from the bad company they collected, was to be
held at a neighbouring town, and told his father to pre-
are for a large demand on his cash, as he meant to try
his hand at all the varieties of gaming which the scene
presented. Mr. Greville laughed heartily at what he
called the boy's right spirit, and promised him all he
required; but there was a quivering on her mother's lip,
a deadly paleness on her cheek, that spoke volumes of
suffering to the heart of the observant MAry, who
sat trembling beside her. Still Mrs. Groeville did not
speak till her husband left the room; but then, as Alfred
was about to follow him, sle caught hold of his hand,
and implored him, with such a tone and look of agony,
only to listen to her, for her sake to give up his intended
pleasure; that, almost frightened by an emotion which in
his gentle mother he had scarcely ever seen, and suddenly
remembering that he had lately been indeed most unkind
andneglectful to her, he threw his arms round her neck,
and promised with tears, that if it gave her so much pain,
he would not go; and so sincere was his feeling at the
moment that, had there been no temper near, he would,
in all probability, hase kept his word. , but the moment

sneered at his want of spirit in preferring his mother's

be the case, every better feeling fled. This ought to have

his ill-temper on his wife, to be neglected. IHIe sought
her, where she was superintenling MAry's lessons, and
for nearly an hour poured upon her the most fearful
abuse and cutting taunts, ending by declaring, that all
the good she had done by her saintly eloquence, was to
banish her son from her presence, whenever he left home,
as in future Alfred should he his companion; and that
he should begin that very day. Mrs. Greville neither
moved nor spoke in reply; and the expression of her
countenance was so sternly calm, that poor hilary felt as

heart was bursting.

engrossed in thought for Mrs. Grille, that she did not
feel disposed to speak either. Herbert was contacting

which he was rewarded, gave him such a glowing feeling
of pleasure, as almost to lessen the pain of his humiliation.

and does not allow such fees; thinks it wrong to go
to such places, acting against morality, and such out of
the way ideas.''
Are these MIr. Grahame's opinions?'' inquired
Perey, almost sternly.
 Why ye-yes-why do you look at me so
Percy? I am sure I said no harm; I only repeated
what I have heard MIamma say continually.''
 That is not the vergecast excuse for your disrespect to
our father ; and if he think thus, Wonder you should talk
of going to the races: ou cannot have his permission.''
Oh, but Mlamma has promised if I am a good boy
till then, and she can manage it, I shall go; for she
cannot see any harm in it. And as for waiting for
Papa's permission-if I did, I should never go any-
where. IIe is so unkind, that I am always afraid of
speaking or even of playing, when he is in the room.''
You are a silly boy, Cecil,'' replied oung Hamilton,
 Believe me, you do not know your best friend. I

 Oh. but yours and mine are very different sort of
people. Your apa neer punishes you, or refuses you

If Papa thinks my wishes foolish, or liable to lead

should not so much mind Tapa's severity when I am
naughty, if he would only be kind or take some notice
of me when I am good. But has Mr. HAmilton told
you not to go to the races ?''
Not exactly: he has merely said he thinks it a day
most unprofitable wasted; and that the gambling and
excesses always the attendant of races, are not fit scenes
for young persons. Were I to take my horse and go, he
would not, perhaps, be actually displeased, as I am old
enough now, he says, in some things to judge for myself;
but I should be acting against his principles, which, just
now, I am not inclined to do, for I am sure to suffer
from it afterwards.''
 Yell, all I can say is, that when I am as old as
you are, Percy, I shall certainly consider myself under
no one. I hope I shall be at Eton by that time, and
then we shall see if Cecil Graeme has not some spirit
in him. I would not be tied down to Haywood, and to
M. HOward's humdrum lessons, as you are, Percy, for
worlds.''
Take care that Cecil Grahame's spirit does not
effervesce so much, as to make him, when at Eton,
wish himself ask at Moorlanls,'' replied Perey, laugh-
ing heartily at his young companion's grotesque attempt
at self-consequence, by placing his cap iandily on his
eal, flourishing his cne, and trying to make himself
look taller. Cecil took his laugh, however, in good
part, and they continued in amicable conversation till
MIrs. Hamilton summoned Percy to attend cr home.

very often led him into error and its disngreeable con-
sequences; and, fearing this lad again been the case,
she playfully inquire the cause of his most unusual
abstraction. He coloured, but ended the question,
and successfully roused himself to tall. IIis mother
was not anxious, for she had such perfect confidence in
him, that she knew if he had committed error, he would
redeem it, and that his own good feelings and high
principles would prevent its recurrence.
It so happened, however, that young Hamilton, by a
series of rather imprudent actions, had plunged himself
into such a very unusual and disagreeable position, as
not very well to know how to extricate himself from it
without a full confession to his father; which, dnringly
brave as in general he was, he felt almost as if he
really had not the courage to make. One of MIr.
Hamilton's most imperative commands was, that his
sons should never incur a debt, and, to prevent the
temptation, their monthly allowance was an ample one,
and fully permitted any refractive indulgences they
might desire.
Now Percy was rather inclined to extravagance, from
thoughtlessness and a profuse generosity, which had
often caused him such annoyance as to make him
resolve again and again to follow his father's advice,
and keep some accounts of his expenditure, as a slight
check on himself. Tue admiration for beauty in the
fine arts, which his mother had so sedulously cultivated,
had had only one bad effect; and that was that his
passion for prints and paintings, and illustrated and
richly-found volumes, sometimes carried him beyond

examined the letterpress of such works, as well as the
eugravsrings and bindings. Ile had given orders to MIr.
CArries, a large fancy station, librarian and publisher
6of T-, to procure for him a set of engraving, whose
very interesting subjects and beautiful workmanship MIr.
Grahame had so vividly described to him, that young
Hamilton felt to do without them till his father or he
himself should visit the metropolis, and so judge of
their worth themselves, was quite impossible. The
order was given without the leastregard to price. They
arrived at the end of the month, and the young gentle-
man, to his extreme astonislcnt, discovered that his
month's allowance had been so expended, asnot to leave
him a half quarter of the necessary sum. What to do
he did not very well kno. Mr. HArris had had great
difficulty in procuring the prints, and of course he was
found in honour to take them. If he waited till he
could pay for them, he must sacrifice the whole of one
month's allowance, and then how could he keep free
Irom debt till the next? As for applying to his father,
s shrunk from it with actual pain. IIow could he
ask his ever kind and indulgent parent to discharge a
left incurred by such a thoughtless act of tunnels-
snr extravagance MIr. NOrris made very light of
it, declaring that, if MIr, Percy did not pay him for a
twelvemonth, it was of no consequence; he would trust
him for any sum or any time he liked. But to make no
attempt to liquidate his debt is as impossible as to
speak to his father, So, after a violent struggle with his

so in two or three months, at the very latest, discharge
the whole.
One week afterwards he received is month's allow-
acc, and riding over directly to the town relieved his
conscience of half its lond. To have only half his usual
sum, however, for monthly expenditure caused him so
many clocks and annoyances as to make him have the
very sight of the prints whose possession he and s
coveted, but he looked forward to the next month to
be free at least of MIr. Harris. The idea of disobedience
to his father in incurring a debt at all causing him ore
annoyance than all the rest.
Again the first day of the month came round, and
putting the full sum required in his purse, he set off,
but on his way encountered such a scene of distress,
that every thought fled from his mind, except how ta
relief it. He accompanied the miserable half-famished
man to a hut in which lay a seemingly dying woman
with a new-born have, and two or three small half-
stared, half-naked children,-listened to their story,
which was really one of truth and misfortune, not of
whining deceit, poured the whole contents of his purse

to go directly, and also to report the case to those who

impellel by a height of lend. The conviction flashed
upon him that he had been giving away money which
was actually not his own; and the lead which had been
productive of so much internal happiness, now seemed
to reproach and condemn him. Ie rode back without
even seeking Mr. Harris, for what could he tell him as
the reason of his non-payment.' certainly not his having
given it away.
The first of MAy, which was his birthday, he had
been long engaged to spend with some young men and
lads who were to have a grand game of cricket, a jovial
dinner, nn adjournment to some evening amusement,
and, to conclude the day, a gay supper, with glee and
songs. Mr. HAmilton had rather wished Percy to leave
the party after dinner and had told him so, merely
however, a a preference, not a command, but giving
him permission to use his own discretion. Percy knew
there would he several expenses attendant on the day,
but still he had promised so long to be one of the party,
which all had declared would be nothing without him,
and his own inclinations so urged him to join it, that it
seemed to him utterly impossible to draw back, use-

Perey, though steady in entirely abstaining from all
excess, s not quite so guarded as usual. A clergyman
hud lately appeared at T-, whose appearance, manners,
and opinions had given more than usual food for gossip,
and much uncharitableness. IIis eloth since ought
to hose protected him, but it rather increased the
satire, sarcasm, and laughter which he excited. He was
brought forward by the thoughtless youths of Percy's
party, quizzed unmercifully, made the object of some
clever caricatures and satires, and though young lIIamilton
at first kept aloof, he could not resist the contagion.
Ie dashed off about half-a-dozen verses of such re-
arguably witty and clear point, that they were received
with roars of applause, and an unanimous request for
distribution ; but this he positively refused, and put
them up with one or two other poems of more innocent
wit, in which he was fond of indulging, into his pocket.
The any closed, and the next morning brought with
it so many regrets, and such a eonfuscl recollection of
the very unusual excitement of the previous eren-
in, that he was glad to dismiss the subject from
his mind, and threw his satire, as he believed, into the
fire. In fact, he was so absorbed with the disagree-
able conviction hat he would only pay MIr. CArries a third
of his remaining debt, trifling as in reality it was, that
he thought of nothing else. Now MIr. Harris was the
editor and publisher of rather a clever weekly paper,

For the next few days Percy trod on air. He had

he really had discharged his debt, take courage and con-

bim shrink from any farther concealment. IIe hoped

constant annoyance he had been enduring so long, a4s
sufficient penalty for his disobedience, and after a time

What, then, was his grief, his exation, almost his
despair, when he recognized in the poem selected, the
verses he thought and believed he had burneltle morn-
in after they were written; and which in print, and
read by his sober self, seemed such a heartless, glaring,

he ever could gain courage to confess it, it should be to
IF. HAmilton alone; but the more he thought, the move
for the first time his courage failed. It was only the day
before his visit to Lady Helen's that he had discovered
this accumulation of misfortune, and therefore it was not
much wonder he was so dispiritel.-Two days after-
wards lIerbert, with a blushing cheek and very timid
voice, asked his fighter to grant him a great favour. He
was almost afraid to ask it, he said, but he hoped and
believed his parent would trust his assurance that it
was for nothing improper. It was that he might be
from home the next day unattended for several hours.

to ride, and his horse was so steady, he hoped he might

surprise broke from his sisters and Edward. Percy

errors, than have even another HErbert. So, pry do
not look so salt, or I shall fancy I have given you pain,

Percy threw his arm around her waist, and kissed her
two or three times, without saying a word, and when he
started up and said, in his usual gay tone, that, as he was
not going to turn truant the next day, he must go and
finish some work, she saw tears in hisees. That some-
thing was wrong, she felt certain, but still she trusted in
his candour and integrity, and did not express her fears
even to her husband.

horse, and after affectioually embracing his mother, and
again promising care and steadiness, parted. He had

earnestly, that a double portion was prepared for the
next day. He has said, as he was starting, that, if he
might remain out so long, he should like to call at

enjoyed the most unalloyel happiness. IIis pretty

the worth of their son, imply repaid them for former

the road was rugged, and in some parts dangerous ; but
he was not a man to shrink from his duty for such

monotonous; and for some months the conflict for
submission to this inscrutable and most awful trial was
so terrible, that he nearly sunk beneath it. This was
of course still more physical than mental, and gradually
subsided, as, after eighteen months' residence in Alberta,
where he was sent by a benevolent friend, some portion
of health returned. The same benefactor established
his father i some while but most welcome business
in London, and earnestly, on his return, did his parents

all that differs from their preconceived ideas; to such
persons MIr. MOrton must be an object of derision.

It is never sufficiently guarded, and it would

to sell  double or treble number of his papers. I
spoke to him at once, and bought up every one that
remained ; but though he expressed regret, it was not
in a tone that at all satisfied me as to his feeling it,

himself with a strong effort, before either of his family
could conquer their anxiety and alarm, and, standing
erect, though pale as marble, without in the least degree
attempting excuse or attenuation, acknowledged the
poem as his, and poured out his whole story, with the
sole exception of how he had disposed of the money,
with which the second time of receiving his allowance he
had intended to discharge his debt; and the manner
in which he told that part of his tale, from the car

certainly more calculated to call for dot than belief.
Herbert was about to speak, but an imploring glance
from Percy checked him.
Mr. Hamilton was silent several minutes after his
son had concluded, before he could reply. Perey was
so evidently distressed-had suffered so much from the
consequence of his own errors-felt so intensely the
unintentional publication of his poem-for his father
knew his truth far too well to doubt his tale, and there
was something so intrinsically noble in his brave con-
session, that to condemn him severely he felt as if he

MIr. HAmilton looked very thoughtful, but she did
not make any rejoinder.
In the hour of recreation Emmcline, declaring it was
much too hot for the garden, sought her mother's
private sitting-room, with the intention of asking where
she could find her father. To her great delight, the
question was arrested on her lips, for he was there.
She seated herself on his knee, and remained there for
some minutes without speaking-only looking p in
his face, with the most coaxsing expression imaginable.

WhiLE the young heir of Soaked had passed
no very pleasant day. HIs thoughts since MIr. Howard's
return had been so preoccupied, that his studies had
been unusually neglected; so much so, as rather to
excite the displeasure of his gentle and observing pre-
ceptor. he emotion of the morning had not toned
to steady his ideas, and a severe reproof and long ipo-
sition was the consequence. Not one word did he
deign to address Herbert and Ewvard, who, perceiving
him leave the Vicarage with every mark of irritation,
endeavoured, during their walk home, to soothe him.
His step was even more rapid than that in which
he had left home, and he neither stopped nor spoke
till he had reached his father's library, which, fort-
namely for the indulgence of his ire in words, was un-

his books with violence on the ground, and burst forth-

Percy'' exclaimed Irs. HAmilton, who, having
sought him the moment she heard the hall-door else,
had lend nearly the whole of his violent speech, and
was almost alarmed at the unusual passion it minced.
Her voice of astonished expostulation checked his words,
but not his agitation; he threw himself on a chair, and
leaning his arms on the table, buried his face up

down by him, and laying her hand on his arm, said
gently--

pride tried hard for victory. Een his father or lIerbert
at that moment would hne chafcd him into increased

pushed back the clustering hair from his heated fore-
head, and the gentle touch of her cool hand seemed
s restorative as er soothing words; and Percy as he
listened to her, as she continued speaking to him in
the same strain for some little time, felt more received
than five minutes before he thought possible, and more
than ever determined that he would never act so
thougltlessly; or, if he were tempted to do so, never
keep it concealed so long again. MIrs. 1Hamilton's
anxious desire with him, was always to do justice to
his better qualities, at the same time that she blamed
and convinced him of his faults. It was a very delicate
thing, and very difficult to succeed in, perhaps impose-
bible, to minds less peculiarly refined and hearts lese
intensely anxious than Mrs. Hamilton's; but no diff-
cult, no failure, had ever deterred her-and in Percy
she was already rewarded. He was of that high fine spirit,
that any unjust harshness would have actually confirmed
in error-any tnguarded won bring argument on
margaret, and so, for the mere sake of opposition, cause
him to abide in his opinions, when the acknowledgment

of his being right in some things, produced the rolun-

3And now about these unfortunate verses, my dear

happened that you did not destroy them directly you
returned home.''
1 fully intended, and believed 1 had done so,
Mother, but the whirl of that night seemed to
extend to the morning, and I pressed and prepared
for Mr. Howard in such a hurry (I had oerslept
myself too), that though Had quite resolved they should
not pollute my pocket-book any longer, I had no time
to look over my papers-thought I could not be
mistaken in their outside-burnt those I really wished
to keep, and threw those which has caused me all
this pain into my portfolio. Ir I had but ben firm
enough to have followed my father's advice, and left
my companions before supper l-or, if I did join them,

And you have suffered enough for an evening's
excitement, my poor boy; but i am sure you would
atone for it, if you could.''

to cancel that odious poem, and blot it from MIr.

He looked at her in utter bewilderment.
Do both, Mother?'' he repeated.
203
Yes, my boy it is a painful remedy, but it would
be an ineffectual one. Seek Mr. MOrton, and tell him
yourself your whole story.''
Percy crimson to the very temples.
Do not ask me such a thing, Mother,'' he answered,
very hurriedly;  I cannot do it.''
 You think so at this moment, my dear boy; I
am not at all astonished that you should, for it will be
very humiliating and very painful; and if I could spare
you either the humiliation of the pain, yet produce the
same good effects, I need not tell you how gladly 1
would; but no one can remove the sting of that poem
from MIr. MOrton's sensitive feelings but yourself, and
I am quite sure, if you will allow yourself a little
time for quiet thought, you will agree with me.''
But why should 1 inflict such pain upon myself,
granting I deserve it?' answered Perey, still much
heated; hen, though my poem is the only one that
has unfortunately met his eye, the others were quite as
galling, and my companions quite as much to blame
-why should I be the sufferer ?''
 Because by many errors you live brought it on
yourself. Your companions did indeed act very wrongly,
but are we quite sure that the principles which your
father and MIr. Howard have so carefully impressed
upon you, have been no carefully impressed upon them
and in such a case are not on the more responsible?
They hal evidently no inward check to keep them from
such an amusement; you had, for you have acknowledged
that you kept aloof at first, knowing it was long, and

only yielded from want of sufficient firmness. Inflict the
pain of an avowalupon yourself, my boy, and its memory
will help you in future from yielding to too great weak-
ness-and the act prove to us that, though for a moment
led into great error, you are still as brave and honest
as we heliere you,''
Percy did not reply, but his countenance denoted
an inward struggle, and his mother added-
 Suppose, as is very likely, MIr. Morton becomes
intimate here; how can you, with your open truthful
heart, associate with him, with any comfort or con-
evidence, even though perfectly satisfied that we would
not betray you, and that he would never know the
truth? You may fancy now that you could, but I
know my Percy better; but I must not talk to you any
more, for the dressing-hell rang some minutes ago.
Remember, my dear boy, that 1 lay no command on
you to seek Mlr. MOrton; I have only told you that
which I believe would restore you to happiness and
atone for your faults, more effectually than anything
else; but you are quite at liberty to act as you think
proper.''
She left the room as she spoke, but Perey remained
for some few minutes longer in deep thought, and when
he prepared for dinner and joined his family, it was
still in the same unbroken silence. Mr. IIamiltou took
no notice of him, and two or three time the little

IIe kissed her forehead and left her, and a few
minutes afterwards she was summoned to join her
mother, Caroline, and Ellen in a walk. They saunteed
through the grounds in the direction of the northern
lodge, which opened on the road leading to Dartmoor;
when, not a quarter of an hour after they had left the
house, they were overtaken by Percy, riding at what
seemed almost a hand gallop, but he had time as he
passed his mother to gracefully off lis cap, and her
fond heart throbbed, as she caught the expression of
his flushed but earnest face. He was out of sight in
another moment, followed hy obert, who was the late'

HAmilton was somewhat surprised at the even more than
ordinary warmth with which her son was greeted by her
friends, and at the flush which stained his cheek at MIrs.
Grille's first words-

looked at him her eyes glistened in tears,''
Of, not in the last,'' he replied instantly, and as
if he would exceedingly like to change the subject; but
Ms. Greville, turning to MIrs. HAmilton, continued-

Perey has not returned, and his mother became dread-
fully anxious. TIer husband at her request waited a
quarter of an hour, but reluctantly; for he was more
particular that every member of his household should
assemble at the stated hour of prayer, than in any other
point relating to his establishment. Secretly, however,
had the first word been said, when Were and Robert en-
tered, and the former, with a very rapid, but noiseless step,
traversed the large room, and knelt in his accustomed
place. In ain did MIrs. Hamilton try to keep her
thoughts fixed on the service. Had he really been a
MIr. Morton, and if he had, how had he been received?
had his fine spirit been soothed or irritated? and a
thousand other nameless but natural fears thronged her
heart. But one look at her son as he rose reassured
her ; his cheek was flushed with rapid riding, but his
dark cyc sparkled, and he looked more bright and
joyous than he had done for weeks. He advanced
without hesitation to MIr. Hamilton the moment the
domestic had quieted the library, and said, eagerly, but
still respectfully-

Astonished an touched, far more than he was her in
the habit of allowing himself to feel, much less to his-
play, Mr. Hamilton had some lifhieculty in replying
but his words were even more than satisfactory to his
son's eager heart, for he answered earnestly-
Pray to not give me any praise for my courage,
Apps; I am quite sure, if it had not been for Mamma's
suggestion, I neer could have done it. It might have
crossed my mind, but I fear pride would not have per-
limited me to listen to it ; but when MIamma put the case
before me as she did, I could not present my conscience
from feeling the truth of all she said, and if I had not
followed her advice, I should have been more miserable
still. Dearest mother,'' he continued, as he turned with
even more than his usual affection to receive her nightly
embrace, ``you have made me so happy how can I

laughing; ``she fancies there is something extraordinary
about Ellen, which she cannot comprehend; and I feel

for by her early trials and constant ill-health. So I1

I was the Christmas vacation-always a happy
season in the halls of Lakewood. The previous year,

January, as circumstances permitted, had not taken
place, on account of MIrs. Fortescue's death, and was

usual joy. Caroline and kEmmeline were never permitted
to go to indiscriminate parties. To or three, really
confined to children, their mother allowed their joining
with Miss IIarconrt, in the course of the year, but
their own ball was always considered the acme of
enjoyment, especially now that Caroline began to fancy
herself very much to old for only children's parties.
annie went almost everywhere with Lady HElena, and
quite laughed at the idea of joining children, and
Caroline this year began to wish most intensely that
her mother would take her out to grown-p parties
too, and lost all relish for the pleasant parties she has
enjoyed. MIrs. HAmilton never obliged her to go out
with Emmeline and Ellen, if she really did not wish it;
but Caroline could not get any farther in considering
herself a woman.

they were still more with their father and mother; and
the few serious readings and lessons they had, were
from and with them alone; MIss IIarcounrt's time was

Ellen made no reply, though the tears started to her

fell to the ground, and its beautiful blossom hung on
the stalk, preserved from being quite broken off only by
three or four delicate fibres. It was Caroline's favorite
plant; one she so cherished and tended, that Percy called
it her netted child; and poor Ellen stood paralysed; she
raised the pot mechanically, and rested the broken head
of the lower against the still uninjured sprig, and it
looked so well and natural, that the thought for a
moment darted across her mind that after all it might
not be discovered. Then name all her and's lessons of
the many ways of acting an untruth without words, and,
therefore, even if it should not be discovered, was no
comfort;-but could she, dared she voluntarily confess

had been at home, she might in that first moment have
gained the necessary courage; but she was not expected
back for two or three hours, and Ellen sat with her face
buried in her hands, only conscious of misery, till her
cousin's joyous voice called out from the hall-

Percy was satire, so obliging, so amusing in his queer
ways of working and talking, that she almost forgot
the impending trial, till she met her aunt and cousins at
luncheon. Edward had been so intent, so happy at his
business with his uncle; that he never cast a thought as
to how the stand got back, and after lunch he had to g

her mother, quietly; ``the fate of your flower seems to

But what right had Ellen to touch the stand ?'
 None-she has both disobeyed and again tried to
deceive me; faults which it is my duty to chastise, but
not yours to upgrade. Answer me, Ellen, at once and
briefly; your fault is known, and, therefore, all farther
equivoeation is useless. Did you move that flower-
stand ?e
Yes,'' replied the child, almost choked with sobs,
called forth the more from the contrast which her aunt's
mildness presented to Miss HArcourt's harshness and
Caroline's violent anger; and from the painful longing
to say that her first disobedience was not entirely her
own fault.
Did you remember that I had expressly forbidden
either of you to attempt to move it?''

the apparent hardwood of her conduct escaped from
both Miss Harcourt and Caroline.

I should have been better satisfied, Ellen, if your
fear of my displeasure had prevented the committal of
our first fault, not to aggravate it so sinful by both
acted and spoken untruths. Painful as it is to me in this
season of festivity and enjoyment to inflict suffering, I
should share your sin if I did not adopt some measures
to endeavour at least to make you rereber and to
avoid it in future. I have told you so very often that
it is not me you mostly offend when you speak or act
falsely, but God HImself-who is Truth-that I fear
words alone will be of no avail. Go to your own

brother and cousins are so happy and unrestrained, may
bring you to a sense of your aggravated misconduct

Ellen quieted the room without answering; but it was

far more culpability if possible-for he was permitting

on her arms which rested on the table, so despondingly,
so sorrowfully, that Edward felt too uncomfortable to
remain with her. He was satisfied that he could not
help her; but the disagreeble thought would come, that
if he had not tested her to disobey, sle would have

a variety of active amusements to get rid of the feeling.

The next night, to Ellen's disposition, as a greater
trial than the friday. She neither expected, nor hardly
wished to be allowed, to go to MIr. HOward's, though,
as the affectionate Emmelinc has come to wish her
good night, and with tears in her eyes repeated her
regrets that she was not to go, she felt the hitter
disappointment more than in the morning she had
thought possible; but Saturday night it had been her
aunt's custom, from the time she had been at Norwood,
to visit her daughters and niece before they went to
sleep, and prepare them for their Sabbath's rest and
enjoyment, by an examination of their conduct during
the past week, and full forgiveness of anything that
had been wrong. When younger, MIrs. HAmilton had
attended to his duty every night; but wishing to give
them a habit of private payer and self-examination,
independent of her, she had, after Emmeline was twelve
years old, set apart the Saturn night, until they were
fifteen-old enough for her to relinquish it altogether.
It had been such a habit with her own children, that
they felt it perfectly natural; but with Ellen and
Edward, from their neer having been accustomed to it
as young children, she had never felt the duty understood
by them, or as satisfactorily performed by herself as
with her own. Still, Ellen looked forward to this night
as the termination of her banishment; for great indeed

doors of her cousins' rooms successively close, and her

her kind good aunt would, at least, have come to her.
MIrs. HAmilton had purposely refrained from indulging
her own inclinations, as well as comforting Ellen,
hoping still more to impress upon her how greatly she
had sinned. The impossibility of ler perfectly com-
pretending her niece's character, while the poor child
felt it such a sacred duty to victims herself, made
her far more severe than she would have been, found
she have known her real disposition ; but how was it
possible she could believe Allen'as grief as deep and
remorseful as it seemed, when a short time afterwards
she would commit the sme faults? Her task was
infinitely more difficult and perplexing than less anxious
mothers can have the least idea of.

happiness, but Mr. and MIrs. Hamilton did not expect
that all their other children were to be like him. They
were contented, and intensely thankful also, to perceive
that diverse as were their characters, still the constant
sense of God's presence and of lIes infinite loe was
active and earnest in them all, inciting love and never-
once for Herbert, even though they could not sympathise
with him entirely. Another peculiarity of Mlr. Hamilton
consisted in his permitting no Sunday schools at
Aeliag and his other villages. The Saturday after-
moons are set apart instead of the Sunday. He
wished his wife, and daughters when they were old
enough, to superintend them, and help the children in
preparing for the Sunday services and sUnday enjoy-
ments; but he particularly disliked the system of
oerwork on a day of rest, which could not fail to be
the case, if there were schools to attend to, twice or
three times a day as well as church.
It being the last day of the old yer, MIr. Howard
had expressed a wish that Perey and Edward as well
as DiLiberto should attend church that afternoon, and
the lads, without the least reluctance, consented; Mr.

it was, to, the first day of a new year-always in her

Hamilton sat for some time, after her children had left

more effective, and same hoth Ellen and herself any
further pain.
To the child herself physical learning was so in-
creasing as gradually to deaden mental, till at last it
became so severe, that she felt sick and faint. Sle

 Dear, dear Ellis, get me the medicine, and bathe my

 But indeed, MIss Ellen, she will be displeased if 1

concerned that I had not told her Jane was ill directly,

had every thing proper and comfortable,''
But that is quite different, dear Ellis; do get the

longer without crying: you can tell her afterwards, if
you think you ought.'

Ellen leant her forehead against the side of her little
bel, and held the curtain tightly clasped, as if so to
prevent the utterance of the hysteric so that would
rise in her throat, though she did not know what it was.
But the wholly unexpected sound of MIrs. HAmilton's
voice saying close by her, `I am afraid you have one
of your very bad headaches, Ellen,'' so startled her, as
to make her raise her heal suddenly; and the move-
ment caused such agony, that, spite of all her efforts,
she could not present an almost convulsive cry of

repeated what the child hal said

so very much rather car yo sny you were resolved to
desert my love, than that you did not merit it. Why
should you not deserve it as well as your brother and

to prevent your even endeavouring to deserve it, as the
mistaken fancy that you never shall; but you are too
well to listen to me now; we st try all we can to
remove this terrible pain, and then see if we can bring
back happiness too.''
And for above an hour did Mrs. HAmilton, with the
most patient tenderness, apply the usual remedies, cheered
by finding that, though much more slowly than usual,
still by degrees the violence of the pain dil subside, and
the hysterical affection gie way to natural and quiet

long sleep, and after watching her some few minutes
very anxiously, MIrs. IIanilton sat down by her bed, and
half unconsciously drew towards er Ellen's little Bible,

but she hoped more from the effects of her present
penitence than she had done yet. She had copied, too,
several verses from the various parts of Old and New
Testament which were condemnation of falsehood, and
her aunt felt no longer undecided as to her course of
action.
 You have employed your solitary hours so well, my
dear Ellen,'' she said, as when the chill awoke, and
looked anxiously towards her-she kissed her cheek with
even more than her usual fondness--`` that I scarcely re-
quire your assurance of repentance or promises of amend-
ment. When you have taken some coffee, and think you
are well enough to listen to me, I will read you an ills-
ration of the fearful sin of falsehood from the Old
Testament, which I do not think I have yet pointed out
to you-Ananias and Sapphire: I see you remember.''
And when llen had taken the delicious cup of coffee,

impress, while the mind and heart were softened to re-
clive it. Sle turned to the fourth chapter of the second

the nature of Gehazi's in and its awful punishment,
at the hand of God himself (for the prophet was merely
an instrument of the eXternal, he had no power in him-

Ellen's mind, that she never forgot it.
Do you think Elisha knew where he had been, and
what he had done before he asked him ?'' she ventures
vividly to inquire, as her aunt ceased;  Gehazi had told
a falsehood already to Naaman. Do you think God
punished that or his falsehood to Elisha,?'

read the first twelve and the two last verses carefully with
her, adding-
``Suppose you learn one verse for me every morning,
till you can repeat the whole fourteen perfectly, and I
think that will help you to remember it, my Ellen, and
prove to me that you really are anxious to correct your-

Ellen, very earnestly; :I feel when you are talking to

the disappointment would be if she could not.
It does not hurt me at all if I can rest it, Aunt;

The lights, the joyous voices, even er uncle's kind
greeting, almost overpowered poor Ellen; as Perey, still
preserving his character of an admirable nurse, laid her
carefully on a couch in the sitting-room, where not
only tea was waiting, but the celebrated family tree,
which Mrs. HAmilton's anxiety and Ellen's sorrow had
caused them both to forget, was displayed with even
more than usual taste and beauty.
MIr. HAmilton, when young, had been a great deal
with his father in Germany, Denmark and Sweden,
and brought from the first and latter country certain
domestic observances which had especially pleased him,
as so greatly enhancing the enjoyments of home, and
helping to a right understanding between parents and
children, by increasing their mutual love and confidence.
The family tree, or Christmas Tree, as it was called,
was one of these, and from their earliest years it had
been one of the children's greatest delights on New
Year's Ee. Of course, as they grew older, and
their tastes improved, the tree itself, its suspended
presents, and its surrounding decorations increased in
beauty, and it had never been prettier than it was this
year. The whole of the preceding afternoon had the
young artists laboured in preparing it, for of course,
as the next day as Sunday, it was obliged to be all
finished by the Saturday night; the servants eager in
all things to enhance the happiness of those whose
parents made them so happy, did not care what trouble
they took to help them. They always selected the

room in which there was a very lofty and very deep
oriel window, in the centre of which excess (which was
almost as large as a moderately sized room) they placed
the tree, which was a very large gracefully-cut spruce
fir; it was placed in a tub filled with the same soil as
that in which the tree grew, so that by watering and
care it remained fresh for some time. The tub which
contained it, was completely hidden by the flowering
shrubs that were placed round it, rising in an expanding
pyramid, by means of several flower-stands, till the
recess seems one mass of leaf and flower; amongst
which the superb search geranium, that in Devonshire
gros so luxuriantly all through the winter, shining
against its own beautiful leaf, the brilliant berries of
the holly, with their dark glistening branches, the
snow-berry and flowering myrtle, shone pre-eminent.
Small lamps littered through the lower, and were
suspended in sufficient profusion from the pendent
branches of the tree to half rcseal and half hide the
various gifts and treasures that were there deposited;
and altogether the effect from every part of the roone
was really striking

affection between the brothers and sisters were also
exchanged, that the tree was quite loaded, an many a
time had Mr. and MIrs. Hamilton discovered some trait
of character or some ruling fancy, been in such a simple
thing as the manufacture and presentation of home
gifts. Their own idea of family ties was so strong and
so holy, that one great aim in the education of their
chile was to make them not only loe inch other,
but are thought and attention for individual feelings
and wishes, and so heighten feeling hy action, not
depend entirely on natural ties. MIrs. Hamilton had
known many young persons who were parish in attend-
tions and een presents to friends, but never imagined
that their own home circle had the first and strongest
claim to kindness, whether of word or deed. She knew
that affections and thought lavished on comparative
strangers near valiante on home, but that when given
to home first, they shel light and kindness far and near.
Their tea was indeed a faithful one; llen had been
very fearful of citing Mlr. Howard, for she thought
he must have been told how naughty she had been, but
if he had, there was nothing in his manner to say to:
for he shook hands with her, and een kissed her most
kindly, and told her, laugingly, that she must be quite
well by the next night, or how was she to dance? That
he thought it would be  good thing if Emmeline could
give her a little of her dancing mania, as she hardly

sober. Edward, every passing thought of self-reproach

Harcourt took the same notice of Ellen as the rest.
The person who was to act the WViznrl's part, and by
means of a long and detach the rations treasures from

and originality, that a general one declared him the
very choices Wizard they had ever hal. To enumerate
nll the contents of that marvellous tree would e is-
possible. Their parents' gifts to each of them were not

the delight, when after a terrible tussle to detach a large
roll of cloth, down it came, right on MIr. HOward's
head, and almost enveloped him with its folds, and
proved to be a beautiful cover, which he had long de-.
sired for a favorite table in his drawing-room; at the
embroidered order of which, not only the three girls,

watch in at night; and manufactured two little presses
out of work for is aunt, so delicately and neatly, that
she promised him they should stay on the mantelpiece
of her dressing-room as long as they would Iast.
Caroline had knitted her mother a very pretty bag,
and Emmeline nd Ellen had collected for her a variety
of leaves throughout the year, and arranged them with
great taste, both as to grouping and tinting, in a sort
of small herbal, with two or three lines of poetry,
selected and carefully written by each alternately,
attached to each page. Mars. Hamilton was excessively
pleased, as she was also with a portfolio formed by
drawings from both her boys, and tastefully made up
by MIss IIareourt; and with their gifts to their father,

which MIr. HAmilton had several months, if not more
than a year before, expressed a wish to possess, but

in which the gem was buried, that he had given up all
thought of it. Herbert, however, had not, and never
rested from the time his father spoke till he had found

so valuable, their father delighted them by saying
that he would not exchange it for twenty of the most
precious volumes in his library. sCh evidences of the
home influence they had given, in permitting leisure
for the cultivation of taste and imagination, teaching
them the beautiful, and opening innumerable resources
of enjoyment within themselves, and thence allowing
them to enhance the pleasures of others, were indeed
most gratifying to those earnest and affectionate guard-
ians. From their earliest years they had been taught,
that to give the greatest amount of pleasure to their
parents, their gifts must be all, or at least have something
in them, of their own workmanship, and to enable them
to do this, the lads had been taught in their hours of
recreation to use all sorts of tools, visiting and knowing
something of a variety of handicrafts; and the girls to
work and draw, and even bring the stores of Nature to
their aid when needed, as in the present case, with
Emmeline and kEllen's tasteful gift.

why it should be so carefully concealed, by the way in

bore her aunt, that it exceeded in intensity even that

or the thought of their promised ball were the first
that entered the minds of the young party at Norwood,
as they opened their eyes on New Year's dAy, it was
not very unnatural. Perey gloried in the anticipation of
being master of the ceremonies, and in conducting the
whole affair with such inimitable grace and gallantry,
that very one should declare it was far superior to any
party, old or young, of the season, except Mlr. HOward's;
that a beyond him, he said, for he could not put MIr.
Hoard's head on his shoulders. Herbert anticipated
thc comments of MAry Greville's society, talking to and
dancing with her undisturbed, and to hearing the almost
universal remark, hat a sweet girl she was. Edward
did not exactly know what he expected, but he was in
such a mood of hilarity and mischief, that the servants
nll declared MAster Fortescue was `' mated.'' T,
Caroline their ball was almost always (though union-
fessedly) the happiest evening in her year. She knew
he was handsome-Anne Graeme hal told her how
very much she would he admired in London, and that
if she were not hcr very dearcst friend, she should easy
her beauty terribly. She often in secret longed pain-
fully for admiration and image; and, child as she still

nonE 1PRESEnCE.
HAmilton's eldest daughter, in addition to her real
attractions, she always received both in sulticicnt mea-
sure, as to satisfy even herself. She delighted in those
evenings when it so cancel that her brothers had
young friends with them, making no hesitation in eon-
messing that she very much preferred conversing with
boys than with girls, there was so much more variety,
more spirit; nd though her mother's heart would
actually tremble at the fearful ordeal which an intro-
action to the pleasures of the world would be to such
a character, still she would not check the open express-
sion of such sentiments by reproving them as wrong,
and not to be encouraged. She knew, that though
education might do much, very much, it could not
make natural characters all alike; nor, in fact, did she
wish it. She did not grieve and complain that, with
all her efforts, she could not make Caroline give her as
little trouble and anxiety as Emmeline, nor did she
imagine that she should see the effect of her earnest
prayers and cares all at once, or without constant re-
lapses in the cherished object of her cre. She did
all she could to counteract a tendency which, situated
as she would be when she entered life, must, without
some strong high principle, lead to suffering, and, per-
has, to in-for what is country? But she indulged
in no idea of security, never believed that because she
has so red, so striven to show the good seed, it could
not fail to bring forth goad fruit. She knew many
trials might be in store for her, for how might she
hope to pass through life blessed as she was then?

if she failed not in her task, He would bring her joy
at last.
To Emmeline the idea of dancing as quite enough
to be the acme of enjoyment. The only drawback was,
that in the intervals of rest there was to be a little music,
and though her mother had excused her at MIr. Howard's,
she knew that if anybody expressed a wish to hear her
at her own house, play she must; and at those times
she was half sorry she had chosen to learn the larp in-
stead of the piano, as Caroline played so well on the
latter instrument, nobody would care to hear her; but the
harp was rather a novelty, and no little girl who was
coming played it, and so she was sadly afraid there was
no escape for her, and that was very disagreeable, but
he would not think about it till the time came; the
dancing to such music as MIr. HAmilton had ordered
from Plymouth was joy enough.
Ellen, though rather afraid of so many strangers,
could not resist the general contagion of anticipated
enjoyment. She did not indeed wake with the thought
of the ball, but with the determination to lead the
verse of the Psalm her aunt had pointed out, and go
and say it to her in her dressing-room before she went
down. And as the first verse was very short, she
learned two, and repeated them without missing a
word, and so as if she quite understood them-that her
aunt was very much pleased and then Ellen could
think of and join her brother's and cousins' delight,
even though MIrs. HAmilton was obliged to be what
she called very cruel, but what Ellen knew was very
kind, though it did seem a restraint, and keep her very
quiet all day, instead of letting her run about from

room to room, as Emmeline and Edward, and even
Percy did, for fear of another headache; and so well did
quietness succeed, that she looked and was unusually
well, and so was almost likely by the evening.
Just before dinner, percy, who had gone to ride, be-
cause he said he was sure he should get into some scrape
if he did not give a natural vent to his spirits, galloped
back in company with a gentleman, whose presence
seemed to occasion him still greater excitement
 WHere is my mother and is my father at home?''
he asked impatiently, flinging his horse's rein to
Robert, desiring him to take every care of the gentleman's
horse, as he should not let him leave Dogwood that
night; and then rushing across the hall, threw open
the door of their common sitting-room, and exclaimed-
MOther, give me a vote of thanks and praise for
my invincible eloquence-IIere is this anchorite, this
monk of the moor, who, when I first encountered him,
seemed so doughty a denier of my wishes, actually
conquered-lel a slave to your feet: reward me by
throwing all the fascination you possibly can in his
way, that he may only dream of his cold ride and
desolate cottage on dartmoor to-night.''
e quiet, madcap.'' replied Mars. HAmilton, rising
with very evident pleasure, and coming forward with
extended hand; ``your noisy welcome will not permit
mine to be heard. THis is, indeed, a pleasure, Mr.
Morton,'' he ndled, addressing the young clergyman
with that ernest kindness, which always goes to the
heart, `and one that Mr. hamilton will most highly
appreciate-it, as I trust, the chains my son has thrown
or you, are not so they us to become painful.''

1 should rather fear the pain will be in casting
them off, Mrs. Hamilton, not in the wearing them,''
replied Ir. norton, almost sadly; ``it is the knowledge,
that mingling as often in your home circle as Mr.
Hamilton and my friend Percy desire would wholly
unfit me for the endurance of my loneliness, that keeps
me so aloof, believe me. Inclination would act a very
different part, bnt there was no resisting such eloquence
and such happiness as his to-as,'' he continued, more
gaily
And Mr. Hamilton and Herbert entering as he spoke,
their greeting was quite as warm and eager as Percy's
and his mother's, and MIr. MOrton gave himself up for
the evening at least to enjoyment. His own generous
nature had been particularly struck h Percy's manly
conduct with regard to his satire, and different as were
their characters, a warm friendship from that moment
commenced between them. It was impossible to resist
Perey's warm-heartedness of word and deed; and that
he would sometimes lace his luxurious home, and stay
two or three days with MIr. MOrton, seeming actually to
enjoy the rude cottage and its desolate localities, and
spread such a spirit of mirth within and around, that
it was no wonder the afflicted young man looked to his
society as almost his greatest pleasure, especially as he felt
he dared not too often accept Mir. Hamilton's continually
proffered invitation. Lockwood was the home which
had been his beau ideal for long years, but which now
seemed wholly unattainable. He felt himself doomed
to solitude and suffering, and the struggle for content
and cheerfulness was always more painful after he had
been with his friends.

INCOME 1NLUENCE.
When all preparations for the evening were concluded,
even the respective toilettes complete, Percy and Em-
feline found it impossible to resist trying the spring,
as they called it, of the onken floors (whence the ear-
pets had been removed), and amused themselves by
waltzing in the largest circle they could make. The
beautiful suite of rooms were all thrown open, and per-
ceiling Caroline standing by the piano in an adjoining
apartment, Perey called out,-
Play us a waltz, Caroline, there's a love; the very
lirelicst you can find. iny and I want to try the
boars while we can enjoy them to perfection, that is,
when e are the only persons in the room.''
 You must excuse me, Percy,'' she replied, somewhat
pettishly; I should think you would have dancing
enough in the course of the evening; and what will
our friends think if they come and find me playing?''
 Think? why that you are very obliging, which at
present you are not,'' answered Perey, laughing; ``never
mind, Emmy; let us try what our united lungs will o.''
You may if you like, Percy, but really I am not
clever enough to dance and sing at the same time-I
should have no breath left,'' was her as joyous vrejoinder.
`Come and dance, Caroline, if you will not play;''
exclaimed Elward, who after decorating his button-hole
with a sprig of holly, seemed seized with Perey's
lancing mania.
Do give me an opportunity of practising the graces
before I am called upon to display them.''
 MIy lot of dancing is not so great as to attempt it
without music, so practise by yourself, Edward,'' was
Caroline's quick reply.

brother, very daily; and as Emmcline begged him not
to tease her, he asked-
 WHat has put her in this ill-humour, Emmy?''
e Oh, I don't know exactly; but if you let her alone,
she will soon recover it,''
Well, to please yon, I ill; for you look so pretty
to night, I cannot resist you.''
Take care, Perey, if you try to turn my head with
such speeches, I shall go to Edward and punish you by
not waltzing with yon,'' sid his little sister, shaking
her head at him with a comic species of reproach.
ThAt's right, emmy; do not the fiuttery een from
a brother,'' said her father, coming forward with a smile;
'but will you not tire yourself by dancing already ?''
Oh no, Papa; I feel as if 1 could dance all night
without stopping.''
Not with me, Emmeline,'' rejoined Perey, shrugging
his shoulders with horror at the side; ``I should cry
you mercy, before one half the time and elapsed,''
 But if you are not to be tired, will you not spoil
your dress, and disorder all these flowing curls,'' con-
tinted MIr. Hamilton, ``and surely that will be a great
misfortune,''
` Indeed, it will not, Spa; Perey has surely too
much regard for me, to wilfully hrt my frock, and if
my hair should be so troublesome is to get out of order
Fanny will rearrange it in a few minutes,''
If you wish to cause alarm on that score, my dear
father,'' said mercy, with marked emphasis, ``you must
go to Caroline not to Emmeline. Thank goodness, I
had one sister shoe such petty misfortunes.''
Are you not too hard upon Caroline, Percy?'

Yes, Papa, he is, indeed; do not mind what he

said impetuously-
'I am not, kmmeline. I would lay ny wager that

and so made ler scottish. He froek is not smart enough,
or she does not wear the ornaments she wished, or some
such thing.''
Caroline had fortunately quittel the music-room, or
this sccch would not have tended to restore her
serenity; but before Mr, HAmilton could reply, Edward,
who had been to seek llen, burst into the room, ex-
claiming--
Now, Percy, we may have a proper waltz; Aunt
Emmeliue says we may have just one, before any one
comes, and here she is to play for us, and Ellen for my
partner,'' and they enjoyed it in earnest. MIr. Hamilton
watched them for a few minutes, and then went to seek
his elder girl.
She was alone in a little room prepared for refreshments
tastefully arranging some beautiful flowers in a bouquet.
She looked up as he entered, and so smile that her
fond father thought Percy must be wrong, for there
certainly seemed no trace of ill-temper.
Why are you not with your brothers and sister in
the drawing-room, my denr and why did you just now
refuse your brother such a trifling far as playing a
wal ?'' he asked, but so kindly, that Caroline, though
she brushed deeply, instantly relied-
`Because, Tapa, my temper was not quite restored;

I know he is, my love; he does not always know
how to time his jokes, or to make sufficient allowance
for dispositions not exactly like his own; but tell me,
what first occasioned temper so to fail that solitude
was necessary.''
Caroline's blush became still deeper, and she turned
away her head, saying, very hesitatingly-
 For such a very, very silly reason, Faa, that I d
not like to tell you.''
Nay, my dear, do not fear that I shall either laugh
at or reproach ou. If you feel yourself how very
silly it was, I am not afraid of its gaining too great
ascendency, even if you fail again,''
'It was only-only-that I was not quite satisfied
with the dress Mamma desired me to wear to-night,
Papa; tat was all, indeed.''
You wished, perhaps, to wear a smarter one, my
loe,'' replied her father, kissing her gloving cheek so
affectionately, that the pain of her confession was in-
distant soothed;  but, indeed, I think Mlamma has
shown a much better taste. It requires more care than
you are yet perhaps aware of, to dress so exactly accord-
in to our age and station as to do ourselves justice, and
yet excite no unpleasant feelings in the of a lower, and
no contempt in those of a higher, gratle. MAny of our
friends who are coming to-night could not afford to
dress their children as we might ones, and do you to
think it would be both inhospitable and unkind, by
being over-dressed, to excite any unpleasant feeling of
inferiority in their minds, when actually none exists?

for difference of fortune alone can never constitute
inferiority. I am wizard enough to guess that was
MIamma's reason for your being attire so simply and
et so pretty to-night, and equally wizard enough to
guess your reason for wishing to be smarter-shall 1
tell it you?'' he added, playfully. : Because you fancy
MIss Grahame will he attired in such a very fashionable
London costume, that yours will appear so very plain
and so childish. I see by that conscious smile, I have
guessed correctly; but, indeed, I would not exchange
my dear ingenuous Caroline, even were she attired in the
cottage's stuff froek, for Annie Grahame, did she bring
worlds as er dowry. And as you like ornaments, went

scarlet geranium in the rich dark hair that shaded
Caroline's noble brow; ``and if gamma inquires, tell
her for father place it there, as a token of his
approbation, for temper conquered and truth hesitant-
tingly spoke-spite of pain.''
Caroline's brilliant eye sparkled with a more delight-
ful sense of pleasure than any triumph of dress could
have bestowed, and in answer to her father's inquiry,
for whom she had arranged such a beautiful bouquet,
she said-
It is for Mama, lens Papa-Emmcline is always

has so bewildered her, that she has forgotten it, so I
may just have time to present it before any one comes,''

(for Alfred was at home for a few months), in addition
to MIr. Morton and their own family group; and the

young clergyman could not but admire the natural
grace with which Caroline, after warmly welcoming her
guests, presented her flowers to her mother. It was a
very little thing, but the joys aud griefs of home are
almost all made up of little things, and Mrs. Hamilton
was pleased, not from the attention alone, but that it
proved, trifling as it was, that the annoyance and dis-
content which her command had occasional in her
child had left no nnkind feeling behind them, and the
manner with which she received it made Caroline very
happy, for she lad inwardly feared her ill-temper not
only deserved, but had excited, her mother's displeasure.
Emmeline's look of disappointment and selfreproach
at her own unusual forgetfulness was so irresistibly
comic, that Percy and Elward burst into an immoderate
fit of laughter, which the former only checked to ask
Caroline where she had been, and what she had done,
to produce such an extraordinary change for the better
in her appearance in so short a time.
Oh, you have no right to my secrets, Perey,'' was
her perfectly good-humoured reply;I do not think I
shall answer you, except by having the charity to refer
you to Pass, who has produce the change.''

removed anything like stiffness or reserve which the
younger guests might have at first experienced amongst
themselves. After to or three quadrilles, the spirit
of enjoyment seemed to reign alone, not only amongst
the dancers themselves, but even those who sat out and
talked, either from preference or censuses the sets were
full. Percy, his brother, and cousin were so active, sa
universal in their attention and politeness, that all had
the same measure of enjoyment; there was no sitting
down four or five times consecutively for any one, and
therefore neither weariness nor dissatisfaction. Where
there is a great desire in the piers of a party to make
every one as hapy as themselves and thoroughly to
enjoy it, they seldom fail to succeed. And there was
such a variety of amusements in the various rooms that
were thrown open, suitable for all ages-from the
mammals and papas to the youngest child, that it was
scarcely possible to feel anything but pleasure. Very
many sets had been formed and danced before the
Grahame family appeared, and as Caroline glanced at
her friend and even her little sister, it required a very
vii recollection of her father's words to prevent a
feeling of false shame, while Annie looked at Emmeline
and even her favorite Caroline for a few minutes with
almost contempt.
People talk so very much of Mrs. Hamilton's taste,'
she thought, ``but she can hne none in dress, the's

rather uncomfortably as earnest, ``or lI fear you will
find but little amusement.'' Alfred Greville at that

in her presence. Cecil and Lilla were soon provided
with little partners, and dancing with much more real
delight than their sister.
It was scarcely possible for any one, much less a
parent, to look at Caroline that night without admiral-
tion. She was so animated, so graceful, so pleasing, and
as such completely the centre of attraction (and really
without any effort on her part) to all the gentlemen,
young or old in the room. The lads congregated round
her, and it was rather a difficult task to keep clear of
offence, when so very many more entreated her to dance
than the length of the evening permitted; but she ma-
named to talk to all, and yet not to neglect any of her
own sex, for she always refused to dance, if she fancied
her being in the quadrille prevented any couple who
had not danced so much, and at those times contrived
to conciliate five or six instead of only one. Emmeline
took charge of the younger children, often refusing to
dance with older boys, who would have made her much
pleasant partners, that she might join the little
quadrille, and set them all right.
I am really glad to sec Ellen amongst us to-night,
and seeming truly to enjoy hersolt,'' said MIrs. Greville,
addressing Mrs. HAmilton, who was standing rather
part at the moment, watching Carolina with such min-
led feelings of pride and dread, that she was quite glad
when her friend's voice disturbed her train of thought.

That it was not illness which prevented her ; but she

 You touched on a very painful theme,'' replied MIrs.
HAmilton, with real relief;  Ellen and I were not quite
as good friends as we usually are last week, and my
poor little girl felt my severity more than i imagined or

If you think so, Mrs. Grille, you will agree with

den The idea that childhood is in itself the happiest
season in life is so far mischievous, that it prevents the
necessary care and watchfulness, which alone can make
it so. But we must not philosophies any more, for it
has made us all grace. I see my wife is addressing MIss
Grahame, and I think it is for music. Come, Norton,

guests, young and old, seconded the move: Annie
Grahame really played remarkably well, so far as exsecu-

was delighted at the expression of Graham's face as he
listened to his child and the applause she exited.  WHy

which Lady HElena's face presented to her husband's;
she knew annie played well, she had heard it from very
superior judges, and how could it concern her what
the present company thought ?
A very pretty vocal duet from the two sisters followed,
and soon afterwards Caroline approached the music-

and Percy, with his usual love of provoking, exclaimed-

Indeed, my dear Miss Hamilton, ours exceed
hers; no master's heart is in his pupil's progress, as a
mother's in her child's, even should she not teach, but
merely superintend,''
Caroline was seated at the instrument as he spoke,
and there was something in his few words touching a
right chord; for as she began to play she certainly
thought more of her mother than any one else; and
determine, if possible, that others should think with MIr.
MOrton, forgetting at the moment that very few, except
their own immediate circle, knew whose pupil she was,
not imagining that the mistress of Lynwood and its

part of the education of her daughters. MOrton was

Herbert approached, and eagerly whispered some request.

mine be enough ?'"
 What, with Mary? I rather think, your request in
this case will be of more weight than mine;'' and a few
minutes afterwards Mrs. Hamilton led the blushing
timid girl in triumph to the piano. TIer voice, which
was peculiarly sweet and thrilling, though not strong,
trenbled angrily as she commenced; but HErbert was
turing over the leaves of her music, his mother was
standing close bcsile her, and after the first few base

leen blue earnest eyes, the hectic colour that with the
least exertion rose to her creek, the transparency of
complexion, the warm and elevated spirit, the almost
angel temper and endurance in er peculiarly tried lot,
that scarcely seemed of earth; and never was that sad
forcboding stronger than at that moment, as she looked
round the crowd of young and happy faces, and none
seemed to express the same as MIarg's. She could
scarcely command her voice and smile sufficiently to
warmly thank her young favorite as she ceased; but
MAry was more than satisfied by the fond pressure of
her hand.
This little interruption to the actual business of the
evening only increased the west and enjoyment, when
dancing recommenced. Eren the call to supper was
obeyed with reluctance, nand speedily accomplished, that
they might return the sooner to the ball-room. The
ours had worn away it seemed on gossamer-wigs, and
as each happy child felt assured that the delight could
not last much longer, the longing to dance to the very
last moment seemed to increase. Emmeline's excitable
spirit had thrown of all alloy, for it was quite impossible
any one would think of asking her to play how; she had
arranged all the remaining couples-for the room had
been very much to this-for the favorite IIaymaker's

if she would verify her own words, and dance all night.
MIss Grahame had declared it was much too great a
romp, aud declined joining it. Caroline who would
have enjoyed it, out of more politeness ta ler friend
then inclination, sat down with her, and a cheerful
group of some of the older lads, and one or two young
Lives joined them. HErbert and Mary, finding the
quadrille for which they were engaged, changed to a
dance for which, though they had quite the spirit, they
had not the physical strength, enjoyed a quiet chat
instead, and Ellen seated herself by her favorite Mary,
declining, from fatigue, Alfred Grerille's cntreaty that
she would second Emmeline.
rI declare I could dance myself with that merry
group,'' exelimel Mr. Grahame, after watching them
some time, and all his austerity banished by the kind
spirit of the evening. ``MIrs. HAmilton, MIrs. Grerille,

Both allies laughingly begged to be excused, offering
however, to introduce him to a partner.
No; it must be one of you or none at all. That

she and Elward will go, and the rest follow just like
a pack of cards. Do, pray, prevent such a catastrophe,
for I assure you it is not in the least unlikely.''
The gravity with which he spoke caused a general
laugh; bnt Mrs. HAmilton, feeling by the length of time
the fatiguing dance had lasted, there was really some
truth in his words, desired the musicians to stop;
causing an exclamation of regret and disappointment
from many youthful lips, and Emmeline and Edward
an up to her, to entreat that they might go on a little
longer. MIrs. hAmilton, however, refused; and Edward
yielded directly, but Emmeline was so much excited,
that obedience was most unusually difficult; and when
her mother desired her to sit down quietly for ten
minutes, and then come to the music-room, as Mrs.
Allan most particularly wished to hear her play before
she left, she answered, with more petulance than she
was at all aware of,-
I am sure I cannot play a note now-it will be no
nse trying.''
Emmelinel'' exclaimed her mother, adding, gravely,
I am afraid you have danced too much, instead of
not enough.''
The tone, still more than the work, was enough;
poor Emmeline was just in that mood when tears are
quite as near as smiles; her own petulance seemed te
reproach her too, and she suddenly burst into tears.

TIer little girl's only answer was to bury her face still
more closely in her mother's dress, very much as if she
would like to hide herself entirely; but on MIrs. Allan
saying, very kindly-
Do not distress yourself, my dear. I would not
have asked to hear you play, if I had thought youwonld
dislike it so much. I dare say you are very tired, and
so think you will not succeed,''
She raised her head directly, shook back the fir

tears were still on her cheeks and filling her eyes,
said, with a blending of childish shyness and
courageous truth, impossible to be described:

was too tired to play, and what careful training must it
has been to have so taught truth.
 MIrs, Allan would not ask you before, because she
knew you did not like to play while the room was so
very full; therefore, ought you not to do your very best
to oblige he?'
Emmeline looked timely up in her mother's face,
to be quite sure that her displeasure had subsided, as
her words seemed to denote; and quite satisfied, hcr
tears were all checked, and taking MIrs, Allan's offered
hand, she went directly to the music-room.
MIrs. HAmilton lingered to desire Herbert (who had
come up to know the cause of his sister's sudden tears]
to form the last quadrille, and reserve a place, if he
possibly could, for Emmeline, as they would not begin
till she had done. Her little girl was playing as she
rejoined her, and it really was a pretty picture, her fairy
figure with her tiny harp, and her sweet face seeming
to express the real calling with which she played. There
was no execution in the simple Highland air, but her
vivid imagination lent it a meaning, and so, when fairly
playing, he did not mind it. MIrs. Allan had lost a
little girl just at mmeline's age, who had also played
the harp, and thcro was something in her cares and
thanks after she had done that made Emmeline stand
quietly at her side, without heeding the praises that
were lashed round her. IIerhert at that moment

Come, Emmy, we are only waiting for you; Mr.

 Pray do,'' added MIrs. Allan, as her son gaily
pleaded his own case; Emmeline only waited to real
her mother's consent in her eyes, for she thought that
she ought not to dance any more; and in another
minute the joyous music had resounded, and she was
dancing and chatting as gaily and happily as if there
had been no interruption to her joy.
`' And you will live all these delights to imprison
yourself in a man-of-a?'' asked Mr. Grahame, jestingly
of Board, while waiting for his wife and daughters,
who were the last departures (much to hAnnie's horror,
for it was so unfashionable to he quite the last), to be
cloaked and showed.
'Imprison21'' was his very indignant reply, ``and on

laughing hertil; ``any one would think he had been
a sailor all his little life. You talk boldly now, ny
boy, but you may change your tone when you have
once tried the cockpit,''
I do not think I shall,'' answered Edward, earncstly;
I know there are many hardships, and I dare say I
shall find them more disagrceeable than I can possibly
imagine; but I shall get used to them; it is so cowardly
to care for hardships.''

And it is no grief to give up all the pleasures of

I exchange them for others more delightful still,''
 and the sea is to be your sister, uncle, aunt, and

Yes, all,'' replied Edward, laughing; adding, as he
put his arm affectionately round Ellen, ``my sister has
so many kind friends that she will be able to spare me
till I am old enough to do all a brother ought''
 You are a good fellow, Elward, and I see I must
not talk of parting, if I would preserve this evening's
pleasure unalloyed,'' Grahame said, as he said his
hand kindly on Ellen's head, and then turned to obey
the summons of his wife.
The young party no doubt felt that it would be in-
finitely more agreeable to sit up all night and talk of
the only too quickly concluded enjoyment, than to
retire to their respective pillows; but the habits of
Lakewood were somewhat too well regulated for such
dissipation, though, no doubt, their dream-land that
night, as people with the pleasant shadows of reality,
and, according to their respective sources of enjoyment,
brought back their evening's happiness again and again.

and sought his mother, by very fond attention on his
part, to remove the pain of Caroline's conduct.
This continued for about a fortnight, at the end of

MIr. IInmilton trusted that her child was becoming

Annie Grahne had imparted to her friend, in strict
confidence, that her mother intended giving a grand
ball about the end of February, and meant to entreat
MIr. Hamilton, as a person four, to let Caroline be
present. Caroline little knew the very slight foundation

The invitations (three weeks' notice) for her parents

Now Lady HElena really hal asked, though she did

MIrs. HAmilton quite forgot that MIss Grahame was not

It happened that about this time Miss Harcourt left
Oalwood for a week, on a visit to an invalid friend at

promising that er pupils should lose nothing by her
absence. She left of the Saturday, and the Thursday
was LAdy Helen's ball. On the MOnday, MIr. HAmilton
detained Edward as he was leaving the library, after
morning prayers, and told him that he had received a
letter, which he thought might chance to interest him.
Ten minutes afterwards, Edward rushed into the break-

could scarcely speak.

day when her own much-loved brother, her darling

I expected,'' MIrs. Hamilton said, as she entered the
school-room, and found the three girls preparing their
books, ``so I must set you all to work, and see how well
you can get on without me till eleven, when I will rejoin
you. I shall order the carriage at half-past twelve, and
if all I require is completed, we will pay your favorite
old ruin a visit, eMmy; the morning is so lovely, that
I think we may venture to take our sketch-books, and
see what other part of Berry Pomeroy we can take pen-

Such an anticipation was quite enough for Emmeline.
Her dance about the room as only checked by the
idea that er lessons would never be ready, for her ex-
ercises and sums done, unless she sat quietly down, and
so, with a great effort, she gave all her attention to her
various tasks, and mastered them even before her mother
returned. Ellen, though she tried quite as much, was
not so successful. The Prince William would sail in
miniature on her slate, over all her figures. The recoil-
section of the awful storm they had encountered on their
oyge to England would return so vividly, that the
very room seemed to head. And then-but she could
not make out whose should think about that then,-her
mother' s death-bed came before her, and her promise, and
it seemed harder still to part with Edward, from a vague
dread that came over her, but still she tried to attend
to what she had to do, and congratulated herself on its
completion before her aunt appeared

believed would follow, Mars. hamilton said very kindly-
I should very much like these done correctly, Ellen,

and we shall not interrupt you as we should if you remain
at this table. I know they are both very difficult, to-

ment, you know the more pleased I shall he,''
Ellen oecd direct; a little care, and with the
assistance of her grammar, which her aunt permitted
her to refer to, instead of depending entirely on her
memory that morning, enabled her to succeed with her
French; but four times was that tormenting sum re-
turned, till at last her tears effaced the figures as fast as
they were written. Still, patience and resolution in
both teacher and pupil conquered, and the fifth time

putting back the heavy ringlets which in Ellen's absorbed
attention had fallen or her tearful clerks, said, play-

Shall I tell you a secret, my little Ellen? I was
quite as disinclined to be firm this morning as you were
to be patient; so you see we have both gained a grand
victory. Iy conjuring propensities, as Emmy thinks
them, told me that you had real cause for some little
inattention, and, therefore, that it was very route in me
to be so determined; but my judgment would tell me

inclination and overcome a difficulty, was a much better
way of lessening even natural sorrow than to give up.

Ellen was so glad, that she felt almost happy, and her

lIlamilton had been so kind as to countryman the car-
ridge till one, that she and Caroline might have the to
finish. But Caroline, if she had not tried before, was
of still less capable of doing so. Every word of kind-
ness addressed to Ellen increased the storm raging
within, and the difficulty of restraining it in MIrs.
Hamilton's presence caused it to burst forth with un-
mitigated violence the moment she quieted the apart-
ment, desiring Emmeline and Ellen to make haste, and
put away their books, but still without taking the least
notice of her. Injective, reproach, almost abuse, were
poured against Ellen, who stood actually frightened at
the violence she had so very innocently excite, and at
the fearful and deforming passion which inflamed her
cousin's every feature. Caroline's anger ad discounted
time, or she must have known that her mother could
not have gone far enough, for such unusual tones of
excitement to escape her quick hearing. MIrs, Hamilton,
startled and alarmed, returned directly, and so iidly
id her child's appearance and words recall her own
misguided sister in those uncontrolled fits of fry, under
which she had so often trembled, that present disappoint-
ment, and dread for the future, took possession of her,
and for the moment rendered her powerless. Caroline was
too much engrossed to perceive ler at first, and she had,
therefore, time to rally from the momentary weakness.

What does this mean 7'' she exclaimed, fixing her
eyes on Caroline, with that expression of quiet but stern
reproof, which, when she dil use-and it as very
seldom-had the power of spending even the wildest
excitement. e What has Ellen done, that you should
abuse her with this unjust and cruel and most unfemiuine
violence? You hae indulged your ill-temper till you do
not know what you say or do, and you are venting on
another the anger which my displeasure has caused you
to feel towards me, and towards yourself. I desire that
you will control it directly, or retire to your own room,
till you can behave with some degree of propriety, and
not disturb the comfort and happiness of others in
this most uncalled-for manner.''
I will not go,'' answered Caroline, bursting into
violent tears, and scarcely aware of what she was saying.
I know I dislike Ellen, and I have reason to dislike
her, for before she came, you were never so often is-
pleased with me; you are always kind and indulgent ta

Mrs. HAmilton said, as she calmly turn for a moment
to Emmeline and Ellen, who both stood bewildered, the
former from actual terror, that her sister should dare sa

aowal of a dislike which she had intuitively felt, but had
always tried to disbelieve.  The beauty of the day will

be disappointed of our promised ramble. Do not think
anything of what this unhappy girl is saying; at present,
she scarcely knows herself, and will by-and-by will it
recalled, far more intensely than ever we can.''
Emmeline longed to throw her arms round her mother,
and with tears bteseech her to forget what Caroline had
said; but, though Mrs. Hamilton had spoken cheerfully,
and in quite her usual tone of voice to them, there was
something in her countenance, that checked any display
of softness even in her affectionate child ; something that
almost awed her, and she left the room with Ellen to
prepare for the promised excursion, which had, however,
lost all its anticipated enjoyment from the uncontrolled
temper of another.
Now, Caroline, I will answer you,'' said Mrs.
HAmilton, as soon as they were alone, and again regard-
ing Caroline, who was sobbing violently, with that same
searching look.  Your charges are such very heavy ones,
that I really must request you during my absence to
arrange and define them in some order. I am so per-
fectly ignorant of having given on any foundation for
them, that, before I can attempt defence, you must
inform me exactly and definitely of what you complain.
That this morning my manner was kinder to Ellen than
to you I quite acknowledge. Her inattention and de-
pression had a cause, hours had none; for if you were
unhappy, it was from your own fearful temper, which
by encouragement has blackened very thing around
you. Yon may employ your time till dinner as you

command, Caroline, disregard or evasion of which will
be disobedience.''
She left the room, and in a very short time afterwards
Caroline heard the carriage live off; hut for nearly
three long hours she neer moved from her seat, s
utterly miserable, as scarcely ever to change her position.
Neer in her life before, not in her most angry moments,
had she so spoke to her mother, and her remorse was
almost intolerable. Again and again she remembered
what MIrs. Hamilton had told her so often, that, if she
lil not strive and pray against the dominion of ill-tem-
per while young, it would become more and more un-
controllable, and the older she became, the more iflieult
to subdue, even in a moderate degree, and her words
were indeed true. It had been many months since
temper had gained such an ascendeney, and its effects
were far, far more violent, and its power over her more
determined, and if, as she grew older, it should be still
worse, what would become of her? how insufferablg
wetchel. wat would she not e given to have re-
called her words?' The jealousy which had arisen, no
she knew not how, had sunk into air before those fe
calm inquiring sentences for her mother, and in her
excessive misery every kind deed and work and look,
every fond indulgence and forbearance, in fact, all tia
love her mother had so lavished on her from her infancy,
rushed back upon her, till she actually hated herself,
and longed the more intensely for the comfort of that
soothing affection, which, in real pnin or childish sorrow,
had never chen refused her.

hateful ball ?'' she exclaimed, at length, as the sound
of many joyous voices and the dressing-bell pro-
claimed the return of the various members of her
family only in time to prepare for dinner.  It was
all, all from that; I know now, on from that one
thought-one wish. Why was IN such a fool, as not
to tell MIamma at once that I knew I was to be asked,
and wished so much to go?-if she had refused me, it
would not have been half the pain I have made for
myself. And how can I meet Papa's eye and Percy's
unkind jokes with eyes like these?'' she added, as,
on rising to go to her own room, she caught sight of
her own face in a mirror, and actually startled at the
disfigurement, which the violence of her emotion had
wrought. Oh, how I wish MIamma bad ot desired
me to go to her; that I could but hide myself from
everybody-or get rid of his horrible have cloud,''
From every eye but her mother's she could and did
hide herself; for saying that her head aches, which
was the truth, and she did not wish anything to take,
she refused to go down to dinner. MIrs. hAMilton had
successfully exerted herself dring their excursion, and
Emmeline and Ellen enjoyed themselves so thoroughly
as almost to forget the alloy of the morning; and even
when Caroline's message recalled it, the boys were all
so merry, that it did not disturb them. Percy always
declared that Caroline's headache was only another
term for temper-niche, and he would certainly here sent
her one message of mock pity, if his quick eye had
not discovered or fancied that his mother did not look
quite as well as usual, and so he contented himself by
trying still more to be the life of the dinner-tale. Mlr,

HAmilton and seen at a single glance that all was not
quite right, and Caroline's non-appearance and message
explained it, to his extreme regret, for he had begun to
hope and believe that his wife's extreme solitude, on
her account, was heinsius to decrease,
MIrs. HAmilton had not much doubt that silence and
solitude has so far had effect on Caroline as to subdue
passion, and bring her to a sense of her misconduct;
but that ad scarcely power to lessen the anxiety and
the pain which Caroline's words had so wantonly in-
flicted. DIal she indeed evinced anything like undue
partiality -the ide alone almost brought a smile;
fondly, and almost as her own child, as she loved her
little niece. The very anxiety Caroline oeeasioned her
opened her affection; the very control she was
obliged to exercise in her mode of guiding her, strength
ened every feeling towards her. She was so enwrapped in
these painfully engrossing thoughts, in the market ex-
amination of her own heart, that she was not aware the
time she had appointed had passed by full ten minutes,
till she was rauscd by the handle of her door being
softly turned, and left again, as if some one had wished to
enter, but hesitated. The very hesitation gne her
hope, for she really did not know that the utmost
penalty she could have inflicted on Caroline, in the
moment of natural indignation, would have failed in
producing such an effect as the simple command to
see her, and define her charges against her, when that
angry excitement had so called, that Caroline would
have given worlds, if she might but he not referred

daring had left her so powerless that she had stool at

command courage sufficient to open it and enter.
Mrs. HAmilton looked at her changed aspect, the bitter
humiliation expressed in every feature, with such pity,
that it required even more than her usual exercise of
control, to retain the grave and apparently unmoved
tone with which she said-
You have had a long time in which to reflect on
your charges against me, Caroline. I hope they are
now sufficiently defined for me to understand and answer
them. You may sit down, for you do not seem very
capable of standing.''
Caroline glailly obeyed, by sitting down on a low
ottoman, soe little distance from her mother, on whose
neck she absolutely longed to throw herself and heseech
forgiveness; but MIrs. HAmilton's tone was not such as
to give her courage to do so. She remained silent,
burying her face in her hands.
I am waiting your pleasure, Caroline; I should have
thought that you had had plenty of time to think
luring my absence. Of what do you accuse me?''
oH, nothing, nothing Mamma, denr MIamma, do

No, Caroline; were I to condemn you to any

pain you has inflicted on me by your accusation of
partiality and injustice, than from the one of producing
any good end. You are no longer a child, who must

now as well as I can teach it, and if you fail, must be
answerable only to yourself. I cannot help you any
further, than by requesting you to explain clearly the
origin of your complaint against me. Its main ground
of offence is, I believe, that since Ellen as become a
inmate of my family I have treated you with more
harshness and kindness than I ever did before. Can
you look back on the last eighteen months and recall
one instance in which this has been the case' I must
have an answer, Caroline; you may now think place-
nation is not necessary, and that you meant nothing
when you spoke, but that will not satisfy me for you,
when ill-temper regains ascendeney. You need not
refrain from answering for fear of wounding me, you
can scarcely do that more than you have done already,''
Caroline tried to speak, but she could only so forth,
that she could not recall one instance, in which her
mother had been more displeased with her than ler
conduct merited. Acknowledging, but almost inarti-
lately, that she had sometimes fancied that she had
remained longer cold with her than with Ellen, after

Caroline, with returning temper.
 Perhaps not, for some persons are so physically
constituted that they do not know what fear is; and
harshness would harden, not terrify and crush, as with
such dispositions as Ellen's. But Caroline, wen temper
gains dominion oer you, as it has done to-day, do
you always think and utter nothing but the truth?''
Caroline turned from that penetrating look and burst
into tears. Few ns the words were, they seemed to
flash light into the very inmost recesses of her heart,
and tell her, that in her moments of uncontrolled
temper, in hcr rooting fncies, she really did forfeit
the truth, an adherence to which she so prided herself;
and that there was no excuse for her in the idea that
she did not know what she said or did-for why had
religion and reason hee so carefully implanted within
her, but to enhle her to subdue the evil temper ere
it acquired such fearful dominion.
Perhaps you have never thought of this before,
Caroline,'' resumed MIrs. HAmilton, and her tone was
not quite so coll; but think of it in future, and it
may help you to conquer yourself. Remember world

she would atone for her fault at least by a full confer-

the pain it was to feel that her mother thought her such

Caroline looked hastily up; her mother's tone was
almost as fond ns usual, and, unable to restrain the
impulse any longer, she started from her low seat, and
kneeling down close by her, clung round her, passion-
lately exclaiming-

Caroline's eyes so earnestly besoght.  Your fault
has been such an aggravated one, that I fear it must
cause you many days of remorse, the most painful kind
of suffering which error can bring; but do not try to
shake it off; I would rather see you endure it, and not
expect happiness for a few days. You know where
to seek the only source which can bring peace and
comfort, and you must endeavour hy earnest prayer to
strengthen yourself for the conflict you have so often to
encounter. You have a very difficult task, my poor
child, that I know; and, therefore, do I to try to
provide you with a guard and help.''

and answer pettishly, and as if it were pleasnnter to
encourage disagreeable thoughts the to read or do
anything that would remove them. And then, when I
would give anything to escape from them, it seems
everybody's fault but my own, and I cannot.''
If you accustomed yourself constantly to pry
against this great fault, my dear child, you would find,
that its very first approach would so startle you, that
you would use every energy to subdue it. IInet I fear,
Caroline, it is only when temper has made you miserable,
as it has to-say, that you are quite aware of its enormity.
You do not think the fault great enough to demand the
watchfulness and care, without which it never will be
subdued'
1 nm afraid I do not indeed, MIamma. I know I do
not make it a subject of prayer, as you have so often
advised me, except when everything looks so black,
and I am so miserable; and then, I icnr, I ask more
to be happy again, the for forgiveness of my in,
and for grace and strength to overcome it. I never felt
this to be the case so strongly as to-day, by your cold-
ness seems to have shown me my whole self, and
I never thought I was so picked, and so I must bc

MIrs. IInmilton involuntarily drew her chill more
closely to hor. The humility, the bitterness of self-
reproach, was so unlike Caroline's usual haughtiness-
so very much deeper than they had ever been before,

Caroline could not reply, for every kind word her
mother spoke seemed to heighten self-reproach, and
make her still more wretched. MIrs. Hamilton felt that
there was no refusal in her silence, and continued talk-
in to her in that same gentle strain a little while
longer, and then rose to lease her,-but Caroline looked
so snrrowful, that she hesitated.
 No, Mlamma; I do not deserve that you should stay

started again to her eyes, for she felt as if it would be
an indescribable comfort still to be alone with her

in the affirmative. I hae of a thing prepared for

you to remain idle the remainder of this evening than
to employ yourself, even with the most disagreeable
task, I would much rather you should do so. Once let
temper be quite subdued, and our heart receive
its necessary government, and I have no fear but that
you will very quickly make up for lost time; and even
if you did not, believe me, my dear child, the grace of
the mind, precious as in general they are considered,
and as they are, still are to me actually nothing worth,
if unaccompanied by a gentle temper and womanly
heart. Do not shrink from the suffering which it will
be to sit alone and think on all that has passed to-lay;
but let your remorse e accompanied by a resolution
(which you are quite capable of not only forming, but of
keeping) not to rest till by prayer and effort you have
sought God's blessing on your difficult task, and so feel
strengthened for its fulfilment; and also for persevering
in it, for you must not hope to succeed in subduing
yourslfall at once. Do this, and I shall be hetter pleased
than if to-morrow morning you brought me a treble

She embraced and left her-to meditations, from
whose bitter, though salutary pain, Caroline made no
attempt to escape; though, had it not been for her
mother's advice, she would gladly hae down to her stu-

was, by doing so, atoning for her fault, instead of merely

not be so cruel, if she were not well, her spirit was so

she turned away without uttering a single word.

LY HERE's ball took place; and Caroline had so
conquered herself, that she could listen to Here's flow-
ing account of its delights with actual cheerfulness. It
was so associated with self-reproach, that she could
scarcely think of it without pain; but she was so con-
vince of her folly in permitting such a very little thing
so to affect her temper as to cause all the misery she had
endured, that she had resolved to punish herself, not
only by listening to Perey, but by herself inquiring the
details. She was a girl of really a strong mind, and
one convinced of error, once released from the fell
dominion of temper, she did not care what pain she en-

word or unkind thought, and to break from the black
cloud that still at times would envelop her. But she
did not give way, constantly eren making opportunities
for self-denial, and doing little kindness for Ellen,
though she was too truthful to profess an affection which
as yet she could not feel.

Early in the following week Mr. Grahame came over

at the party, had been obliged to enact the invalid much
against er inclination, and so entreuted ler mother ta
finite Caroline to spend a few days with her; and, to
her astonishment, her cold harsh father volunteered to go
himself for her. MIr. IHInmilton at once acceded; his
wife hesitate; but she went at once to Caroline, who
chanced to be reading alone in the schoolroom, for it
was the time of recreation, and told her. For a moment
her countenance was actually reality with delight, the
next it clouded over.
 You would like it very much, but you are afraid
I shall not permit you to go; is that the meaning of your
change of countenance'' asked her mother, half smiling.
I feel afraid of myself, MIamma; for I fear I am
always more ill-tempered and proud after any such
pleasure as going to Moorlanuds would he.''
Wild you rather not go, then ''
I cannot sny site that, MIamma; I should like it
very much, if I could but be sure of myself after-
wars.''
Dil you ever feel such a doubt of yourself before,
Caroline, when going to stay with Annie?
 No, MIamma; I seem to have thought a great deal
more the last few days, and not to feel half so sure of
myself''
 Then I think there is less danger for you, that is,
of course, if you are willing to risk the temptation of

wiser not to go; but if you can resist it, if you think
you can return to your quiet daily routine as preparing

me so long to go up again for my keys, and the volume

And she hastily tore out a page from an exercise-bok

exercise that morning, that he had desired her to write
it again. It was very difficult, and had materially
shortened the time which she had promised to devote to
Edward, who as this week released from is attendance
on MI. Howard, to permit him and Ellen to be as much
together as possible. llurried by lim, she left her book
open on the table to dry, and, finding it closed on her
return, put it away, without looking at it. Le following
lay Miss Harcourt, of course, requested to see it, and,
to Ellen's utter astonishment, her exercise was not there;
only the faulty and hotel theme, with no sign to ex-
plain its disappearance. Now we know MIss HArcourt
was rather prejudiced against Ellen, and, as she had un-
happily failed in truth more than one--perhaps she
was not so unjust and harsh as poor llen felt her to
be-she refused to believe her assurance that se lad
written it. No one had been in the schoolroom at the
time to whom she could refer ; if Ellen had never dis-
obeyed or received, of course her word would bc
sufficient, as her brother's and cousins' would.
That you have failed again, both in obedience and
truth, Ellen, lI cannot for a moment doubt, and it cer-
mainly would be my duty to inform your aunt directly;
but as I know it would cause her real suffering to be

to trust too implicitly in your artful professions of re-
entrance,''
Poor Ellen felt too bewildered and too miserable even
to try. That she had written her exercise, she was as
positive as that she had been told to do so; but if she
had-what hat become of it? FInish as Miss HArcourt
seemed, appearances ere certainly very much against
her. She had not a single proof that she had obeyed,
and her word was nothing; even Emmeline looked at
her doubtingly, and as if she could scarcely een pity
her. It was very little comfort to think her aunt was
not to be told. IIcr own impulse was to go to her, and
tell her at once; but how could she be believed? and
MIrs. Hamilton's words iF I other discover another

of all she had suffered, the disappointment it would be
to her aunt, to think all she had said and read to her

in of and trying to act on them, all checked the im-
pulse, and terrified her into silence.
Miss HArcourt was not an acute physiognomist; she
would only read in Ellen's face hardwood and reckless-
ness. We rather think MIrs. Hamilton would have read
something very different; but she was very much
engaged with Edward, and if she did think llen looked
much more out of spirits, she attributed it to natural
feeling at the rapid approach of the day of separation.

least, though every night, that told her another day had
gone, and brought before her all sorts of vague feelings
and fancies of real, she either cried herself to sleep, or
laid awake, still more unhappy. The suspicion attached
to her seemed to double the severity of the trial of
parting. Award was her own; Edward must love her,
with all her faults; but even her aunt, her denr, kind,
good aunt, must cease to have any affection for her, if so
constantly believed guilty of a in so terrible as False-
hood. And she seemed to love her brother still more
than her, every day that brought the hour of parting
nearer-sometimes as if she could not bear the pain of
it being able to Look at his bright face and listen to
his glad laugh and dear voice fr three, perhaps six

crease her unhappiness, for though she knew she was
innocent, still she felt, if MIss HArcourt hal told MIrs.
Hamilton, she could not be so caressed and cared for,
and she was receiving that which she was believed to have
forfeited. MIss HArcourt's face certainly seemed to ask
her as distinctly as words, how she could be so artful,
so tdeceitful as to permit her aunt to take such notice
of her; and so she often shrunk awa, when she most
longed to sit by and listen to her.
Edward's spirits never sobered, except now and then,
when he thought of leaving Mars. HAmilton, to whom he
had given the same love he had lavished on his mother,
perhaps to a still greater extent, for reverence was

Ellen's manner on the MOnday evening annoyed and
prejudiced Miss Harcourt still more; MIrs. Greville and
Mary, Lady Helen and all her family, bringing Caroline
home with them, MIr. Howard, and some of Edward's
favorite companions, all assembled at Harwood, and
every one was determined to be gay and cheerful, and
Edward's voice was the earliest, and his laugh the
happiest there; and Ellen, though her head aehel with
the effort and the constant struggle of the preceding
week, was quite cheerful too, and talked to Mary
Greville, and Lilla and Cecil Grahame, and even to MIr.

from no want of feeling; she wondered indeed at so

for it notwithstanding. Once only Ellen was nearly

She had never in her whole life felt so disinclined to
sing, so as if it were quite impossible; as if she must
cry, if she did; but edward would think it so unkindl
if she refused, for she did not know herself why his
very words should have increased the difficulty, and
what reason could she give him? MAry went, and asked
Mrs. hAmilton to accompany her; and Ellen did her

been so difficult for her, to oblige her, and to be quite
sorry she had pressed it so much, and Edward hal
thanked her, and told her he should sing it in idea very
often. She tried to be merry again, but she could not
succeed as before, and so she kept as near her aunt as
she could all the remainder of the evening, as if she
were only safe there.

Ellen remained by the window looking after the

My dear Ellen, I ve been looking for you every-

curls; ` Emmeline went into your room and could not
find you, and I could not imaginewhat had become of you.
It was not wise of you to come here just this morning,

only that Edward will be happier as a sailor than he
would be remaining with you; and though I know you
must miss him very, very painfully, you will be able to
bear it better. Poor lice Weston, of whom you have
heard me speak, has no such comfort; her brother could
not bear the idea of a sea life, and is scarcely strong
enough for it, and yet, poor fellow, it is the only opening
his uncle has for him, and his poor sister has not only
that pain to bear-for you can fancy how dreadful it

thought he should be miserable- but is obliged to leave

almost alarmed. But Ellen could not go to, much as
she wished it, for her momentary courage had deserted
her, and she could only very more bitterly than before.
 Have you done anything wrong, Ellen? and have
you forgotten my promise?'' inquired her aunt, after
waiting several minutes, and speaking very sorrowfully.
MIss HArcourt thinks I have, Aunt; but indeed,
indeed I have not; I have not been so very wicked
as to tell another falsehood. I know no one can be-
lieve me, but I would rather you should know it, even if
-if you punish me again.''
 You must try to be more calm, my dear Ellen, and
tell me clearly what is causing you so much additional
suffering; for I cannot quite understand you. I cer-
mainly shall not punish you, unless quite convinced you
have failed in truth again, which I do not think you have.
Tell me exactly what it is, and look at me while you are

Allen tried to obey, but her grief had gained such an
ascendency, that it was very difficult. Mrs. Hamilton
looked very thoughtful when she ceased, for she really
was more perplexed than she allowed Ellen to perceive;
and the poor child, fancying her silence could only
mean disbelief and condemnation, remained quiet and
trembling by her side.

Caroline unlocked her desk, drew forth her book, and

whose it was. In my haste the book fell to the ground,
I picked it up to write on it, but never noticed if the

she placed in her aunt's hand, without being able to

You don't seem very capable of doing anything but

You have cried yourself almost ill, and so must bear

 You have not quite guessed it, Lucy. Appearances
were so very strongly against that poor child, that I am
not at all astonished you should have lisheliesedl her
assertion. In the moment of irritation, it is not unlikely
I should have done so myself; but the favour I am
going to ask you, is merely that you will try and neer
shoe that yo doubt her word, or refer to her past
failures, I am quite convinced that truthful is not
Ellen's natural disposition, but that it has been caused
by the same circumstances which have made her such
a painfully timid, too humble, character. of with all her
efforts to conquer herself, she still finds her word
located, and the past brought forward, she never will
be able to succeed. Examine as strictly and carefully
as you please, and as I am sure she will desire, if
necessary-as she did to-day-but oblige me, and never
donut her. If she finds we never do, it will raise her
self-esteem, and give her a still further incentive to ad-
here as strictly to the truth, as she sees we believe she
does. I am certain the habit of falsehood has often
been strengthened by the judicious and crew references
to one or two childish failures. If I am never to be
believed, what is the use of trying to tell the truth? is
the very natural question, and the present pnin of are-
fulness being greater than the visible amount of oil,

I have lived long enough with you to know that

Miss HArcourt, with most unusual fervour.

It is truth, notwithstanding; my poor father's
great preference for Eleanor, when we were children,
her very superior county and quickness, threw me hack

slightly confused, but laughing at the same time.

I am glad I have some saving qualities,'' replied
MIrs. HAmilton, laughing also; :it would be rather
hard to be isolated because I can read other people's
thoughts. HOwever, we have entered into a compact,''

The lay passed much more happily than the more-

a affectionate and successful, that Ellen was quite able
to join them at dinner, and her aunt had selected such
a very interesting story to read aloud, in which one
character was a young sailor, that the hours seems to
fly; and then they had a long talk about poor Alice
Staton and her brother, whether it would be possible
for MIr. IIamiIton to place young eaton in some situ-
tion that he lived better, and that his health was more
fitted for. Ellen said, she should like to see and
know Alice so much, for her trial must be such a very
hard one, that her aunt promised her she should in
the MIdsummer holidays, for alice should then come
and spend a week with them. It seemed as if not to be

as her brother, and live at a school, made her pin

Edward more and more, still her aunt's affection and her

CHAPTER I.
ADVANCE D REspECT.
OcR readers must imagine that two years and four
months have elapsed since our last visit to the inmates
of Lakewood. It was the first week in MArch that
Edward Fortescue (only wanting ten days for the com-
edition of his fourteenth ea) quieted a home, which
was happier than any he had ever known, to enter the
world as a sailor; and it is the 7th of June, two
years later, the day on which allen Fortescue com-
plates her fifteenth year, that we recommence our
natIve.
Oer this interval, however, much as we are anxious
to proceed, we must take a brief glance, clearly to
understand the aspect of the Komodo home affairs,
which, from the increasing age of the younger members,
had undergone some slight change. The greatest and
most keenly felt was the departure of Perey and
Herbert for college, the Doctor clermont after
Edward had gone: the house seemed actually desolate
without them. Percy's wild jokes and incxshaustible

spirits, and RObert's quiet unobtrusive kindness, much
as they had always been truly appreciated by their home
circle, still scarcely seemed to have bccn fully felt till tlc
yoing men were gone; and the old house actually
seemed cnwappcd in a silence, which it required very
determined effort on the part of all who remained in
the last degree to dispel.
Our readers who are mothers, and earnest ones, will
easily understand the anxious trembling of MIrs.
IIamiltan's heart when she parted from her boys for
the world; for such, to spirits fresh, boyish, sophists-
ticatcd, as they still were, Oxford could not fail to be.
For Herbert, indeed, she had neither fear nor doubt;-
no snecr, no temptation, no bad example, would affect
him, in whom every passing year seemed to increase and
deepen those exalted feelings which in his earliest
childhood, had less in them of earth than heaven.''
His piety was so real, his faith so ferent, his elections
so concentrated in his home and in one other indian-
ual, his love and pursuit of study so ardent and needs-
in, his one aim to become worthy in heart and mind to
serve God as his minister so ever present, that he was of-
fectually guarded een from the world. Percy channel
of these feelings to the same extent, save his ardent love
for home and its inmates-is mother, above all. He
did, indeed, gie evey promise that tlc principles so
carefully instilled had taken firm root, and would guide
his conduct in the world; but hEIrs. lInmilton was too
humble-minded-too convinced-that every human
effort is imperfect, without te sustaining and vitalizing
grace of God, to rest in security, as many might hase

done, that house she had so worked, so prayed, sle
just succeed. She was hopeful, indeed, very hopeful-
how could she be otherwise when she bcheld his deep,
though silent, reverence for sacred things-his constant
and increasing respect and before his father-his devoted
affection for herself-his attachment to IIcrbcrt, which
seemed so strangely yet so beautifully to combine almost
reverence for his superior mind and holier spirit, with
the earessing proteetiveness of an elder for a younger-
a stronger for a wake? There was much in all this
to banish anxiety altogether, but not from such a heart
as MIrs. HAmilton's; whose very multiplicity of blessings
made her often tremble, and led her to the footstool of
her God, with a piety as humble, as constant, as fervent,
as many believe is the fruit of adversity alone.
Caroline had sufficiently improved as greatly to
decrease solitude on her account; though there was
still a want of sufficient humility, a too great proneness
to trust implicit in her own strength, an inclination
to prejudice, and a lot of admiration, which all
ade MIrs. Hamilton fear would expose her to some
personal sorrow are they were entirely overcome. To
produce eternal good, she mightnot murmur at temporal
suffering; but her fond heart, though it could anticipate
it calmly for herself, so shrunk from it, as touching her
child, that the nearer approached the period of
Caroline's introduction to the gay world, the more
painfully anxious she became, and the more gladly
would she have retained her in the retirement of
Lakewood, where all her better and higher qualities

she could only trust that her anxiety would he proved
as groundless with Caroline, as every letter from
Oxford provel it to be with Percy, and endeavour to
avert it by never wavering in her watchful and guiding
lore,
Emmcline, nt fifteen, was just the same sportive,
happy, innocent child, as she and been at twelve. HIer
feelings were, indeed, still deeper, her imagination
mnorc vivid, her religion more feryid. lo her every-
thing was touched with poetry-it mattered not how
lull and commonplace it might seem to other people;
but MIrs. IInmilton's judicious cre had so taught that
Truth alone was poetry and bent-the Ideal only
loveable when its basis was the Real,-that she was
neither romantic nor visionary. een ns her sensi-
bilitics were, even over a world of fiction, they
prompted the deed and act of kindness, not the ten
alone. For miles round her father's large domains she
was known, loved, so felt as a guardian spirit, that the
very sound of her step seemed to promise joy. She
actually seemed to lie to others-making their
pleasures hers; and, withal, so joyous, especially in her
own home and ant Greville MInor, that even anxiety
seemed exorcised when she was ncnr. Before strangers,
indeed, she would be shy as a young fawn; though
even then natural blindness of hcnrt prompted such
kindness of word and mayer, as always to excite the
wish to see her again.

had been away, had only once occasioned anxiety.
Two or three months after he had sailed he wrote home

in the highest terms of n certain Gilbert IInrdiag, one
of the senior midshipmen of his ship, for whom he
had received kindness upon kindness; and who, being
six or seven years older than himself, he jestingly wrote
to his aunt and uncle, must certainly be the very best
friend he could have chosen, as he was much too old to
lead him into mischief. Why hc (Harding) had taken
such a fancy to him, Edward could not tell; but he was
so excessively kind, so taught him his duty, and
smooth all the difficulties and disagreeable which,
he owned, had at first comedy overwhelming, that he
never could be grateful enough. He added, that,
though not a general favorite with his immediate
estimates, he was very highly esteemed by Sir Edward
Only and his other superior officers, and that the
former had much commended him for his kindness to
the youngest boy on board, which Edward was. It
was very easy to perceive that young Fortescue's
susceptible affections had all been not only attracted, but
already riveted by this new friend. All the young
party at Norwood rejoiced at it; Mrs. Hamilton would
have done so, also, had she not perceived an anxious
expression on her husband's face which alarmed ler.
He did not, however, make any remark till he had
spoken to MIr. Forward, sand then imparted to is with
anyone, (not choosing to create suspicion in the open
hearts of is children,) that this Gilbert IRidium,
though very young at the time, had been one of the
principal actors in the affair which had caused Mlr.

hccn more than eleven or twelve, and determined
hardwood, so marked natural depravity, that MIr,
Forward had had less hope for him than for any of the
others. This opinion had even borne out by his after
conduct at home; but that the affair had been suc-
carefully hushed up by his family, and by immense
interest he had been permitted to enter the day, where,
it was said, his youthful errors had been so redeemed,
and his courage and conduct altogether and so on him
applause, that no farther fears were entertained for him.
1Ir. IIownrd alone retained his opinion that the dispose-
tion was naturally bad, and doubted the internal response
to the seeming outward good and he was grieved and
anxious beyond measure, when he heard that he was
not only on or the same slip as rEward, but already
his favorite companion and most trusted friend. Iis
anxiety, of course, extended itself to Mr. anl MIrs,
IIamuilton to such a degree, that at the first moment
they would gladly hare endeavoured to exchange his
ship; but this would have seemed very strange to in
Edward Manly, who was one of Mr. IInmilton's most
valued friends. IIe had, in fact, actually learned
Edward's becoming a midshipman till Sir cLearly could
take him in his own ship, and now to place him
elsewhere was really impossible; and, after all, though
he might be removed from1 IIrding's influence, how could
his anxious guardians know all with whom he might be
thrown? They were obliged to content themselves with
writing carnestly and affectionately to Edward, and

painful as it was to throw a doubt and shade over such
youthful confidence and affection, implored him not to
trust too implicitly in BOarding; that his character had
not always been free from stain; that he (Award) was
still so young and so susceptible he might find that he

unconsciously, and suffer from its effects when too late
to escape. hey wrote as affectionately and indulgeutly
as they could,-Mr. FOrward, as well as his aunt and
uncle; but will they felt that it certainly did appear
cruel to warn a oung war heart to break off the first
friendship it has4 formed; especially as he bcheld that
friend approved of by his Captain, and looked up to
by the crew. And that Edward's reply was somewhat
cold, though he did promise caution, and assure them
he had not so forgotten the influences and principles of
Lakewood as to allow any one to lead him into error, did
not surprise them. He never referred to Harding
again, except sometimes casually to mention his com-
panionship, or some act which had on him approval;
and they really hoped their letters had had at least
the effect of putting him on his guard. Sir Edward
Manly's own reply to MIr. HAmilton's anxious appeal
to lim, however, succeeded in quieting their fears: he
assured them he had seen nothing in HArding's
conduct, since he had been at sea, to render him an
unfit companion for any of; that he had earl of some
boyish faults, but it was rather hard he was to suffer
from them as a man; and he assured his friends that
he would keep a strict look out after young Fortcscuc,

selling IInrtiug to some other ship. So wrote Sir
World MInnly, with the fullest possible intention to
perform; nd edward's anxious friends were happy,
nore especially as letter after letter brought praises of
tlc young sailor for captain, officers, and crew, and
his own epistles, though brief, were affectionate and
satisfactory.
It was happy for Mr. and MIrs. Hamilton, an Mlr.
FOrward, too, that they were ignorant of the multiplicity
of great and little things which could not fail to cross
the mind of Sir Edward MInnly, who was not only
Captain of the Prince WIlliam, a gallon seventy-four,

known all the offset of her sister's ill-judged pavrtiality
and indulgence ; but this, as we have already mentioned,
was concealed from her by the bright, lovenble, winning
qualities, which alone were uppermost. Our readers, in
fact, know more of Edward (if they have at all thought

suffer for him) than his ant, penetrative as she was;

Edward's life ate Lockwood had been so very hapy,
its pleasures and indulgences so innocent, so numerous,
that he did not himself know his liability to temptation,
from the excessive love of pleasure which his mother's
indisereet indulgence had originally infused. Ie con-
tool which his uncle and MIr. FOrward exercised oer
him, had been so very gentle and forebears, that he
had scarcely eer felt the inclination to exert self-vill,

had guided himself, when in fact he was guided; but
this could no longer be the case when one of the little

actions were, indeed, under control ; but what captain,
the most earnest, most able in the world, could look
into and guide the hearts of all tlosc committed to his
care? And almost the first action of Edward's unbiased
will was indignantly to tear into shreds, and scatter t6
the winds and waves, those affectionate and warning
letters, and cling the closer to, rest the more con-
findings on, BOarding, for the wrong that he thought he
had done him, by allowing his eye even to rest for a
moment on such base unfounded aspersions on his
ame.

IOMIE INFLUENCE.
When MIrs. HAmilton told Ellen that her letters to
her brother, and his to her, should never be subjected
to any scrutiny hut their own, she acted on a principle
which many parents and guardians would consider as
high-flown and romantic, and which she herself had
most painful reason to regret-the effects, nt least, but
not the principle itself, for that was basel on too refined
n feeling to waver, even though she suffered from it.
She could not bear, nor could her husband, the system
which prevailed in some families of their acquaintance,
that their children could neither receive nor write letters
to each other, or their intimate friends, without being
shown to their seniors. As for opening and reading a
letter directed to one of them, before its possessor saw
it, as they had been done, it was, in their estimation, as
much dishonour and as mean, as if such a thing had
been done to an adult. Perfect confidence in their
home they had indeed instilled, and that confidence
was never withheld. there was a degree of suspicion
attached to a demand always to sce what a child had
written or received, from which Mrs. IInmilton's
pure mind actually shrunk in loathing. In the many
months the Grahame family passed in lOndon, Annie
and Caroline corresponded without the least restraint:
no doubt many would pronounce Mrs. hAmilton very
unwise, knowing Annie so well, and trembling for
Caroline as she did; but as she told MIss hArcourt,
she had some notions peculiar to herself (they always
had the sanction and sympathy of her husband, low-
her), and this was one of them. She was always
pleased and interested in all that er children read to

13
her, either from their own epistles or those they re-
edited, and if they wished it, read them herself, but she
never asked to do so, and the consequence was, that
the most perfect confidence was given.
When Ellen and Edward parted, they were both so
young, that MIr. Hamilton had hesitated as to whether
his wife was quite justified in the perfect trust with
which she treated them, and whether it would not be
wiser to overlook their correspondence; but MIrs.
IInmilton so argued that their very month was their
safeguard, that they were all in all to each other, and
as such sle wished them to feel they were bound by
even a closer and fonder tie than that of brother and
sister under other circumstances, so on over her
husband, that he yielded; and from the long extracts
that Ellen would read of Edward's letters to the family
in general, and of her own to her aunt, he was quite
satisfied as to the wisdom of his wife's judgment.
For full a year after Edward's departure, kEllen's
conduct and general improvement had given her aunt
nothing but pleasure; even Miss Harcourt's and Caro-
line's prejudice was nearly removed, though, at times,
the fancy would steal over both that she was not exactly
what she seemed, and that that which was hidden
was not exactly that which IS. HAmilton believed it;
and this fancy strengthened by a certain indefinable
yet felt change in Ellen, commencing about thirteen
months after she had parted from her brother. Mrs.

times host shrinking, and sad, as in her childhood.
The openness, and almost light-henrtedness, which for
one brief year had so characterized her, seemed com-
plenty but so insensibly to have gone, that MIrs. IlIamilton
could not satisfy herself as to the time of the commence-
mint, or reason of the change. TIer temper, too, became
fitful, and altogether, her aunt's anxiety and bewilder-
ment as to her real character returned in full force.
Onete, when gently questioned as to why her temper
was so altered, llen confessed, with tears, that she
knew it was, but she could not help it, she believed she
was not well ; and Mrs. HAmilton called in MIr. Mnitland,
who said that thermally as in a highly nervous state,
and required care and quietness, and the less notice that
was taken of hcr momentary irritability ar depression
the better. Little did the worthy an imagine how
his young patient blessed him for those words; giving
a reason for and so allowing the trepitation which paled
ler cheek, parched hcr lips, and made her hand so
tremble, when she received a letter from her brother,
to pass unnoticed.
bUt change in manner was not all; almost every
second or third month Ellen's allowance of pocket-
money (which was unusually liberal, nas MIrs. lInmilton
wished to accustom her girls, from an early age, to
purchase some few articles of dress for themselves, and
to learn the value of money) most strangely and myst-
various disappeared. Ellen either could not or would
not give any account of it; and, of course, it not only
exposed her to her aunt's most serious displeasure, but

15
bewilderment and anxiety, but MIss HArcourt's and
Caroline's unspoken prejudice. fRom the time of
Edward's departure, Ellen had never been discovered in
or suspected of either uttering or acting an untruth;
but her silence, hcr apparent determined ignorance of,
or resolution not to confess the cause of the income-
prelensible disappearance of her allowance, naturally
compelled MIrs. HAmilton to revert to the propensity of
her childhood, and fear that truthfulness was again
deserting her. TIer displeasure lasting, of course, the
longer, from Ellen's want of openness, and the air of
what almost appeared to he anxious yet still affectionate
aunt like sullen defiance (in reality, it was almost
despair), when spoken to, caused a painful degree of
estrangement between them, always, however, going
place to MIrs. HAmilton's usual caressing abner, the
moment Ellen seemed really repentant, and her month's
expenditure could be properly explained.
For six or eight months before the day on which we
recommence our narrative, there had been, however,
nothing to complain of in Ellen, except still that in-
natural reserve and frequent depression, as if dreading
something she knew not what, high, as every other
part of her conduct was satisfactory, MIrs, Hamilton tried
to comfort herself was physical alone. No reference to
the past was ever made: her manner to her niece came
the same as usual; but she could not feel secure as to
her character, and, what was most painful, there were
times when she was compelled to doubt even ller's
affection for herself, a thing she had never had the

slightest cause to do even when she was a little inanimate
child.
But very few changes had taken place in the Groeville
and Grahame families. MIrs. Greville'a trial continued
in unmitigated, if not heightened, bitterness: the ex-
ample, thc companionship of his father had appeared to
have blighted very good see while she had strenuously
endeavoured to plant in the bosom of her son. At six-
teen he was already an accomplished man of the world,
in its most painful sense: he had his own companions,
his own haunts; scarcely ever visiting his home, for a
reason which, could his poor mother have known it,
would have given her some slight gleam of comfort.
IIe could not associate either with her or his sister,
without feeling a sort of planting of himself, a longing
to be to them as Percy and Herbert HAmilton were nt
Harwood; and not having the moral courage sufficient
to break from the control of his father, and the exciting
pleasures in which thatcontrol initiate him, he shrunk
more and more from the only spot in which etter feel.
ings were so awakened within him as to give him pain.
To denden this acknowledged remorse, his manner
was rude and unfeeling, so that his very visits, though
inexpressibly longed for by his mother, brought only
increase of grief.
MIs. Greville seemed herself so inured to suffering,
that she bore up against it without any visible failing of
health; struggling against its generation effects, nore
perhaps than she was aware of herself, for the sake of
one treasure still granted her-her own almost angel

MAr-who, she knew, without her love and constant
cheerfulness, must sink beneath such a constant agora-
voted trial. Yet that very loe brought increase of
anxiety from more than one cause. As yet there was
no change in their manner of living, but MIrs. Grerille
knew that, from the excesses of her husband and son,
there very soon must be. Ruin, poverty, all its fearful
ills, stood before her in perspective, and how could
MAry's fragile frame and gentle spirit bear up against
 them? Again and again the question pressed upon her-
Di Herbert Hamilton indeed love her child, as every
passing year seemed to confirm? and ifhe did, ould-
could his parents consent to his union with the child of
such a father, the sister of such a brother? There were
always long messages to MAry in Herbert's letters to
his mother, which Mrs. Hamilton not only delivered
herself, but sometimes even put the whole letter in
Mary's hand, and at last willingly said, she really
thought they had much better write to each other, as
then she should chance to get a letter all to herself, not
merely be the medium of a communication between
them; and MAry, though she did slightly blush, which
she was in the bit of doing for scarcely anything,
seemed to think it s perfectly natural, that she merely
said if Herbert had time to write to her, she should
like it very much, and she would certainly answer
him.
 MIy car Emmeline, what are you about?'' was
Mrs. Grille's anxious appeal, the moment they were
alone.

: Going pleasure to two young folks, of whom I am
most excessively fond,'' was Mrs. HAmilton's laughing
reply. `Don't look so terrified, my dear Jessie. They
love each other as boy and girl now, and if the love
should deepen into that of man and woman, why, all I
can say is-I would rather have your DIary for my
Herbert than any one else I know.''
She is not only my Mary?'' answer the poor
mother, with such quivering of the eye and lip, that
it checked MIrs. Hamilton's joyousness at once.
 She is your DIary, in all that can make such a
character as my Herbert happy,'' was her instant reply,
with a pressure of MIrs. Greville's hand, that said far
more than her words. I am not one of those, who
like to make matches in anticipation, for man' s best laid
schemes are so often overthrown by the most tripling

violence than our greatest wisdom, that I should con-
sider it almost sinful so to do; but never let a thought
of suffering cross your mind, dearest Jessie, as to what
my husband's and my own answer will be, if our
Herbert should indeed ever wish to choose your Mary as
his wife, and, certainly a most important addition,
should she wish it too. Our best plan now is to let them
follow their own inclinations regarding correspondence.
We can, i am sure, trust them both, for what can be a
greater proof of my boy's perfect confidence in my sym-
path with lis feelings towards her, than to make me

will continue to do, even if he write. I have not the
smallest doubt, that he will enclose me his letters to

me her replies in the same unresered manner,''
And she was right. Nor, we think, did the purity
and innocence of those letters, so intensely interesting
to each other, give place to any other style, even when
they changed to discover that MIrs. HAmilton was utterly
ignorant of their contents, except that which they chose
to read or impart to her themselves.
But een this assurance on the part of one so loved
and trusted as Mrs, HAmilton, could not entirely remove
MIrs. Greville's ague anticipations of evil. MIr. Greville
always shunned, and declared he hotel, the Hamilton
family; but as he seemed to entertain the same feeling
towards herself and her poor Mary, she tried to comfort
herself by the idea that he would never trouble his
head about his daughter, or be glad to get her out of
his way, especially if she married well. Still anxiety
for the future would press upon her; only calmed by
her firm unchanging faith in that gracious ever-watchful
Providence, who, is in spite of her heavy troubles she
still tried to trust and serve, would order all things for
the best; and it was this, this faith alone, which so
supported her, as to permit her to make her child'n
home and heart almost as happy as if her path had all
been smooth.
In the Grahame family a change had taken place, in
MAster Cecil's being sent to Eton some time before his
father had intended; but so many cases of Lady IHIelen's
faulty insolence and ruinous indulgence had come under
his notice, that he felt to remove the boy from her intlu
ence must be accomplished at any cost. Cecil was

quite delighted, but his mother was so indignant, that
she overcame her habitual awe of her husband, sufi-
central to now that she would not live so far from her
son, and if he must go to school, she mustlenve MInor-
lands. Grahame, with equal positiveness, declared that
he would not give up a home endenred to him so long,
or so entirely break off his companionship with his
densest friends. A very stormy dialogue of course took
place, and ended by both parties being more resolved to
entertain their own opinion. The interposition of MIr.
and MIrs. IInmilton, however, obtained some concession
on Graham's part, and he promised that, if Lady lIelen
would make Moorlands her home from the middle of
July till the end of October, November and DEcember
should be spent in the vicinity of Eton, and she should
then have six months for London and its attractions.
This concession brought baek all Indy Helen's smiles,
and charmed Annie, though it was a source of real
regret to Caroline, who could not help feeling a little
pained at her friend's small concern at this long separa-
tion from her, but still she loved her; and, as Anne
wrote frequently, and when she was at Mloorlnnds never
tired of her society, (the eight months of absence going
er so much interesting matter to impart,) Caroline was
not only satisfied, but insensible to the utter want of
sympathy which Annie manifested in her pursuits, ler
pleasures. MIrs. Hamilton often wished that Caroline
had chosen one more deserving of her friendship, but
she trusted that time and experience would teach her
Annie's real character, and so did not feel any anxiety
on that score.
IOE 1DEFENCE.

There was only one member in Grahame's family,
that MIr. and MIrs, Hamilton hoped might bring joy and
comfort to their friend, and that was his little Lilla.
She was five years younger than Annie, and being much
less attractive, seemed almost forgotten, and so was
spared the dangerous ordeal of flattery and indulgence
to which Annie had been subject; and from being more
violent and less agreeable than Cecil, was not so fre-
quietly spoiled by her mother. They feared the poor
child would have much to endure from her own temper,
Annie's overbearing insolence, and Lady HElena's cul-
able indolence; but Mrs. Hamilton hoped when she
resided part of the year in London, as she felt she would
very soon be called on to do, to be opened to rouse
Grahame's attention towards his youngest child, and
prevail on him to relax in his sternness towards her;
and by taking notice of her continually herself, instil
such feelings in her, as would attract her towards her
father, and to increase the happiness of both. Very
visit of the Grahame family to MIoorlands, she resolved
to study Lilla well, and try all she could to make one in
reality so estimable, as her husband's friend, happy, in
one child at least.

MInrch for the season, when, as she would be eighteen and
a half, she should be fully introduced. Caroline of course
anticipated this period with the most intense delight.
She was quite satisfied that in her first visit she should
study as much as, if not more than, before; and content
and thankful that her mother would allow her to enter
so far into society, as always to join dinner or evening
parties at home, and go to some of her most intimate
friends, when their coteries were very small and friendly,
and another eagerly anticipated delight, sometimes go
to the opera and the best concerts, and visit all the
galleries of art.
1o poor Emmeline these anticipations gave no pleasure
whatever; she hated the very thought of leaving Oak-
wood, firmly convinced that not the most highly intel-
actual, nor the most delightful social enjoyment in
London, could equal the pure delights of Devonshire
and home. Ellen seemed too engrossed with her own
thoughts to evince a feeling either way, much to her
aunt's regret, as her constant quietness and seeming
determined repression of her sentiments, rendered er
character still ore difficult to read.
But a head disappointment was preparing for Caro-
line, in the compelled postponement of her bright anti-
citations. To understand the causes of which, we must
glance back on an event in the Hamilton family, which
ad occurred some years before its presenthcad was born.

Hamilton, the grandfather of our friend, of the same
name, had been sent by government to the coast of

regard of the reigning sovereign, Christian VII, that on
his departure, the royal wish was expressed for his
speedy return. On his voyage home, he was wrecked
off the Faroe Islands, and rescue from danger and
death by the strenuous exertions of the islanders, who
entertained him and the crew with the utmost kospi-
tality, till their slip was again sea-worthy. During his
voluntary detention, MIr. HAMilton became deeply inter-
 tested in the Faroese, a people living, it seemed, in the
midst of desolation, a cluster of small rocky islets,
divided by soe hundred miles of stormy sea from their
fellows. He made the tour of the islands, and found
almost all their inhabitants possessing the same chirac-
teristics as those of Samboe, the island of which he had
been wrecked; kind, hospitable, honest, temperate,
inclined to natural piety, bnt so perfectly indifferent to
the various prisations and anuoyances of their lot, as to
make no effort towards removing them.  Travelling either
by And or sea was so dangerous and difficult, that in
some parishes, the clergyman could only perform service
time a year,'of or once every one, two, or three months.
The islands in which the clergyman resided, were, MIr.
Hamilton observed, in a much higher state of civilization
and morality tan ambon and some others, and an earnest
desire took possession of him, to do some real service
for those who had saved him from danger and treated
him so hospitably. He very spcedily acquired their

found also that if their ancient customs and traditions
were left undisturbed, they were very easily lcd, and this
discovery strengthened his purpose. Isis departure was
universally regretted; an his promise to return ima-
gained too great a privilege to be believed.
As soon as his political duties in England permitted,
MIr. IInmilton revisited Denmark, and was received
with such cordiality as to encourage him to make his
petition for the improvement of his Majesty's poor
subjects of Samboe. It was granted directly; the little
island so far made over to him, that he was at liberty
to introduce and erect whatever he pleased within it;
and Mr. HAmilton, all eagerness for the perfection of
his plans, returned with speed to England; obtained
the valuable aid of a poor though worthy clergyman,
who, with his wife, voluntarily offered to make Samuel
their home and assist their benefactor, (for such MIr.

ability. A strong built vessel was easily procured, and

each time he had more reason to be satisfied with the
effect of his schemes. MIr, and Mrs. Wilson were per-
fectly happy. heir son was unitetl to the pretty and
excellent daughter of one of the Danish clergymen,
and a young family was blooming round them, so that
there seemed a fair promise of the ministry of Number
continuing long in charge of the same family.
MIr. Hamilton, on his deathbed, exacted a promise
from his son that he would not permit the island to fall
 back into its old habits; but that, if required, he would
visit it himself. The visit was not required, but Percy
Hamilton, (the father of the present possessor of
Lynwood,) from respect to his father's memory, made a
voyage to Samboe on the demise of the elder Wilson.
HE found everything flourishing and happy; Frederic
Wilson had been received as their pastor and head,
with as much joy as their regret for his father would
permit; and Ir. HAmilton returned to England, satisfied
with himself, and inexpressibly touched by the veneration
still entertained in that distant island for his father.
The same promise was demanded by him from his son,
and Arthur HAmilton had visited Faroe directly after
the loss of his parent, and before his engagement with
MIss MAnagers. He found it in the same satisfactory
condition as his predecessors had done, and the letters
he regularly received confirmed it; but for the Last
year and a half he had received no ridings. Frederic

CHAPTER II.
A LETTER, AND ITS CONSEQUENCES.

I was the seventh of June, and one of those glorious
mornings, when Nature looks lovclicr than eer. The
windows of the breakfast-room were thrown widely
open, and never did thc superb trees of Lakewood Park
look richer or display a greater variety of green. The
lower-garden, on part of which the breakfast-room
opened, was actually dazzling with its profusion of
brilliant flowers, on which the sun looked down so
gloriously; a smooth lawn whose green was a perfect
emerald, stretched down from the partner till it was lost
in woody openings, which disclosed the winding river,
that, lying as a lake on one side, appeared to sweep
round some exquisite scenery on the opposite side, and
form another lake, about a mile further. It was
Emmaline's favorite view, and she always declared, that
it so varied its aspects of loveliness, she was sue, it
never looked two mornings exactly alike, and so long
would she stand and admire, that her mother often
threatened to send her, hcr breakfast in her own room,
where the view, though picturesque, would not so com-
plenty turn her attention from the dull realities of life.

There were some letters on the table this morning, so
she had a longer time to drink in poetry than usual.
 WHo can offer Ellen a more precious birthday-gift
than mine?'' exclaimed Mrs. HAmilton, playfully hold-
in up a letter, as hcr niece entered. I wonder, if
Edward remembered how ncar his sister was to fifteen,
and so wrote on the chance of your receiving it on the
day itself.''
 Way, Ellen, what a queer effect pleasure has on
you I always notice, you turn quite pale, whenever
Edward's letters are given to you,'' interposed Emmline,
looking at her cousin, and laughing.`I am sure, the
very hurry I am in to open Perey's and HErbert's,
must give me a colour, and you are as deliberate as if
you did not care about it. I lo wish you would not be
so cold and quiet,''
One giddy brain is quite enough in a house,'' re-
joined her father, in the same faithful tone, and, looking
up from his letter, he called llen to him, and kissed
her. :I forgot the day of the month, my little girl,
but I am not too late, I hope, to say, God bless you, and
wish that every year may pass more happily, more use-
fully, and more prepared for Eternity than the last.'
I do not think you have forgotten it, my dear
Uncle,'' replied Ellen, gratefully, (she had not yet opened
her brother's letter:) `` for my Aunt says, I am to thank
you as well as her for this beautiful birthday-gift,'' and
she displayed an elegant little gold watch; ' indeed, I
do not know how to thank you for all your kindness !''

trying to be a little more likely, and unreserved, my
dear Ellen; that would prove our kindness and alec-
tion made you happy, better than anything; but I am
not going to lecture you on your birthday, and with a
letter from Edward in your hand,'' he continued, smiling.
' Open it, my dear, I want to know its date; I rather
think, my friend MAinly's must be written later.''
Nothing in it for me, Ellen ?'' asked her aunt.

' An enclosure for you, Ellen; way, that is as queer
as your paleness l'' said Emmeline.
Do let your cousin's paleness alone,'' interposed
MIrs. HAmilton, gaily. I really cannot perceive she
has any less colour than usual, and as for the enclosure,
Edward often has something to add at the last moment,
and no room to insert it, and so there is nothing remark-
able in his using another half sheet.''
Emmeline always creates wonders out of shadows,''
said Caroline, dryly.
'And you never see anything but dull, coarse, heavy
realities,'' laughed her sister, in reply.  Come, llen,
tell us something of this idle brother of yours, who
promised to write to me every packet, and neer
does,''
Ellen read nearly the whole letter aloud, and it was
unusually entertaining, for the ship had been cruising
about the last month, and Earl described the various
scenes and new places he had visited more lengthy
than usual. He anticipated with great glee an egege-
ment with some desperate pirates, whose track they
were pursuing.

Nor is it; Sir Edward seed, directed, and put it
up for him in his own to me. Thy had piped all hands,
as he calls it, because the pirate ship was in sight, and
an engagement did take place.''
 And Edward-oh Uncle, is he hurt? I am sure, he
is, by your face,'' exclaimed Ellen, trembling, and all
the little circle looked alarmed.
 Then my face is a decisive,'' replied MIr. HAmilton,
quite cheerfully. IIe only received a slight flesh
wound in his right arm, which prevented his using it to
complete is letter, and I rather think, he would have
willingly been hurt still more, to receive such praises
as Sir Edward lavished on him. Listen to what he says-
Nota boy or man on board distinguished itself more

gallantry are such dazzling qualities in a young lad,

but I cannot say too much for your nephew; I have
not a lad more devoted to his duty. I was glad to
show him my approbation by giving him some days'
liberty, when we were off New York; but I have since
told him, the air of land certainly did not agree with
him, for he has looked paler and thinner eer since.

He is growing very fast; and altogether, if I have
occasion to send another prize schooner home, I think
it not improbable I shall nominate him as one of the
officers, that he may have the benefit of the healthful
bre-yes of Old England, to bring back his full strength.'
There, Ellen, I think that is a still better birthday-
present than even Edward's own letter. I am as proud
of my nephew as Sir Edward is.''
And do you think, he really will come?'' asked
Ellen, trying to conquer her erosion,
 We will hope it, dearest,'' replied her aunt, kindly.
 But do not think too much about it, even if In
Edward be not able to do as he says. IIis own slip
will be coming home in a year or two, and you owned
to me yourself this morning, it did not seem as long as
it really is, since our dear sailor left us; so the remain-
in time will soon pass. Finish your breakfast, and go,
love, and enjoy his letter again to yourself.''
And Ellen gladly obeyed; for it was from no imagin-
ary cause, that the receipt of Edward's letters so often
paled her cheek, and parched her lip with terror. She
knew that, concerning him, which none else but Harding
did; and even when those letters parted nothing but
that which she could read to her family, the dread was
quite enough to banish anting like the elastic happy-
ness, natural to her age, and called for by the kindness
of those she led. His letter this time, however, had
not a word to call for that sickness of the heart, with
which she had received it, and she read it again and
again; with a thankfulness, too intense for words,

when the heart is bursting, had been too early learned.

wild snatch of an old ballad about sailors.
Ellen shut the door, secured it, and with a lip and
cheek colourless as her robe, an eye strained and blood-
slot, read the following words-few indeed.

sum so trifling, that it maddens me to think I cannot

For one long horn Ellen neer move. Her brain
felt scorched, her limbs utterly powerless. Every word
seemed to write itself in letters of fire on her heart and
brain, till she could almost hae screamed, from the
dread agony; and then came the heavy weight, so often
felt before, but neer crushing every thought and
energy as now, the seeming utter impossibility to com-
ply with that fearfully urged demand. He called it a
sum so trifling, and she felt a hundred, by a thousand
pounds were not more difficult to obtain. She had said
indeed, denying herself every little indulgence, every
personal gratification, spending only what she was
obliged, and yet compelled to let her aunt believe, she
had properly expended all, that she might have the
means of sending him money when he demanded it,
without exposing herself to doubt and displeasure as
before; but in the eight months since his last cell, she
had only been enabled to put by fifteen pounds, not
half the sum he needed. Ho was she to get the rest
and she had so buoyed herself with the fond hope, that
even if he did write for help again, she could send it to
him so easily-and now-her mind seemed actually to
reel beneath the intense agony of these desperate words.

been terrible, almost awful in one so young-though a
brief interval would have sufficiently calmed both the
hearer and the speaker, to satisfy, that they were lut
words, and that self-destruction is never breathed, if
really intended-but written, the writer at a distance,
imagination at liberty, to heighten every terror, very
reality, their reader a young loving girl, utterly ignorant
of the world's ways and temptations, and the many
errors to which youth is subject, but from which man-
hood may spring up unsulliedl; and so believing,
almost crushed by the belief, that her brother, the only
one, her own, respected, beloved, as he was said to be,
had yet committed such faults, as would hug him from
his present position to the lowest depth of degradation,
for what else could tempt him, to swear not to survive
it? Was it marvel, that poor Ellen was only conscious

the deep recesses of the windows: her work in her lap,
her hands clasped tightly together, and her eyes fixed
on the beautiful scenery of the park, but not seeing a
single object.

stood by her.  You need not start so guilty and look
so very terrified, but confess that you are thinking
about Edward, and worrying yourself that he is not
quite so strong as he was, and magnifying his wound,
till you fancy it something very dreadful, when, I dare

Ellen made a desperate effort, conquered her tears,

to hear EDward's name, but she served herself to do so,
to acknowledge she was thinking of him, and that it
was very silly to worry about such a slight wound: and

image of her dying mother never left her night or day,
mingled with the horrid scene of her father's death, and
Edward disgraced, cxpcllel, and seeking death by his
own hand. There was only one plan that seemed in the
last feasible, and that was to send to him, or sell her-
self the watch she had received on her birthday, and if
that was not enough, somc few trinkets, which had been
her mother's, and which the last six months her aunt
had given into her own care. She ventured casually to
inquire if there were any opportunity of sending a par-
cel to Edward, but the answer was in the negative, and
increased her difficulty. The only person she dared even
to think of so far intrusting with her deep distress and
anxiety for money, but not its cause, was widow SLang-
for, the mother of Robert, (the young gentleman's
attendant, whom we had occasion more than once
to mention, and the former nurse of nll MIr. and Mrs.
HAmilton's children. She occupied a cottage on the out-
skirts of the park, an was not only a favorite with all the

to College, and Robert remained employed in many
little confidential services for his master at Norwood.
To widow afford, Ellen tried to resolve that she
would apply, but her fearful state of mental agony hal
not marked the lapse of time, or had caused her to for-
get that her letter must be read in a week. The party
were all going a delightful excursion, and to drink tea
at Grerille MInor, so that the would not be lome till
quite late; but in the morning, Ellen, though she had
dressed for going out, appeared to have very smp-
tom of such a violent headache, that her aunt advised
her remaining quietly at home, and she assented with
eagerness, refusing every offer of companionship, saying
if the pain went off, she could quite amuse herself, and
if it continued, quietness and Ellis's nursing ere the
best things for her.
 But give me your letter before we go out, Ellen, I
am only waiting for it, to close mine to ir Edward.-
Why, my dear, have you forgotten I told you it must be
read by to-day?'' her uncle added, surprised at her ex-
animation that she had not finished it.  It must be
done and sent to T. before four to-day, so i do hope you

disappointed if there be not a line from you, especially

noticed. MIr. HAmilton gave her his letter, and in half
an hour afterwards she was alone. She sat for carl
an hour in her own room, with her desk before her, her
face buried in her hands, and her whole frame slaking
as with an ague.
It must be,'' she said at length, and unlocking a
drawer, tool thence a small cross and one or two other
trinkets, put them up, and taking off' for watch, looked
at it with such an expression of suffering, that it seemed
as if she could not go on, carefully folded it up with the
other trinkets, and murmuring, ``if nurse LAngford will
but take these, and lend me the twenty pounds till she
can dispose of tlc, I may save him yet,-and if she

I shall suffer; they will not suspect him. But oh-to

down, cowed by that fearful struggle to the very earth.
After a few minutes, it passed, and deliberately putting
on her bonnet and shawl, she took up ler trinkets, and
set off to the widow's cottage, her limbs so trembling,
that she knew not or she should accomplish even that
short walk.
The wind was unusually high, although the day was
otherwise lovely, and she was scarcely able to stand
against the strong breeze, especially as every breath
seemed to increase the pain in her temples; but she
persisted. 1he nearest path any through a thick

ment entered Ellen's mind. She felt so exhausted by the
wind blowing the branches and leaves noisil nd con-
fully around, that on reaching a sort of grassy glade,
more open than her previous path, she sat down a
minute on a mossy stone. The wind blew some
withered sticks and leaves towards her, and, amongst
them, two or three soiled pieces of this paper, stained
with damp, one of which she raised mcchanicall, and
started up with a wild cry, and seized the others lost
conscious. She pressed her hands over her eyes,
and her lips moved in the utterance of thanksgiving.

she heard them; and she retraced her steps, so swift
-so gladly, the very pain nd exhaustion were felt.
She rote for half an hour intently-eagerly; though
that which she wrote she knew not herself, and never
would recall. She took from the secret drawer of her
desk, (that secret drawer which when Perey had so
laughingly showed her the secret of its sprig, telling
her nobody but himself knew it, sle little thought she
should have occasion so to use,) some bank-notes,
of two, three, and five pounds each, making the
fifteen she had so carefully loaded, and placed
with them the two she had found. As she did so

carelessly put one nsidc, spend up the packet to
Ewvard, enclosed it in her ncc's to Sir edward
Manly, and despatcled it full four hours before the
hour MIr. HAmilton had named. It was gone; and she
sat down to breathe. Some impulse, never experienced
before, urged her, instead of destroying Edward's des-
perate letter, as she had one similar appeals, to retain
it in a blank envelope in that same secret drawer. As
she tried to rouse herself from a sort of stupor which
was strangely creeping over her, her eye caught the
fie pound note which she had not had occasion to use,
and a thought of such overwhelming wrctchedness
rushed upon her, as effectually, for the moment, to
disperse thntstupor, and prostrate her in an agony of
supplication before her God.

IIow long that withering agony lasted, Ellen knew

eyes and heart. The note lay before her like some
hideous spectre, from which she vainly tried to turn.

What could she do with it? Take it back to the spot
where the others had been blown to her? She tried
to rise to do so; but, to her own terror, she found she
was so powerless that she actually could not walk,
With desperate calmness she placed it in the little secret

llen asked for cup of coffee, and to be left quite quiet
instead, as writing had not decreased the pain; and the
housekeeper, accustomed to such casual attacks, did as
she was requested, and came frequently to see her in
the course of the afternoon and evening; still without
perceiving anything unusual, and, therefore, not
targeting her with any expression of surprise or
anxiety.
Thought after thought congregated in the poor girl's
mind, as she thus lays; so fraught with agony that the
physical suffering, which was far more than usual, was
felt, save in its paralysing effect on every limb. Her
impulse was to confess exactly what she had done to
her aunt the moment she could see her, and conjure
her to sentence her to some heavy chastisement, that
must deaden her present agony; but this was impossible
without betraying Edward, and nnllifying for him the
relief she had sent. IIow could she confess the sin,
without the full confession of the use to which that
money had been applied? Whose were the notes? They
were stained ith damp, as if they must have lain

had heard no inquiry made about them, as the loss of
so large a sum would surely have demanded. he only
plan she could think of, as binging thc least hope of
returning peace, was still to beseech MIrs. Langford to
dispose of her watch and trinkets, and the very first
mention she heard made of the loss to return the full
sum to the real possessor, if possible, so secretly as for
it not to be traced to herself. She thought, too, that
if she gave her trinkets, one by one, not altogether, to
MIrs. Langford, it would be less suspicious, and,
perhaps, more easily prevail on her to grant ler secrecy
and assistance; and if she positively refused, unless
Ellen revealed the reason of her desiring their disposal,
and would solemnly promise secrecy, she would tell her
sufficient of her intense misery, as might perhaps induce
her to give her aid. If she did not demand the reason
and betrayed her, she must endure the doubt and serious
displeasure such a course of acting on her part would
inevitably produce; but two things alone stood clear
before her: she must replace that money-she august

day to MIrs. Langford, but she could not move, and
Ellis, at seven o'clock, prevailed on her to dress and
go to bed.

left her very weak for some little time, and so nervous

it was of no conscqucuce, and she would soon recover,

have felt more anxious and discovered something not
quite usual in Ellen's maker, if her thoughts had not
been painfully preoccupied. About a week after their
excursion, she entered the library carlier than usual,
and found her husband intently engaged with some
despatches, just received. She saw he was more than
ordinarily disturbed, and hesitated a moment whether to
address him; but he was seldon so engrossed as to be
unconscious of the presence of his wife.

not going before; the long silence ought to have con-
iced mc that all was not as it should be,''
 But what has occurred, Arthur? I had no idea you
contemplated thc necessity of going,'' replied his wife,
very quietly, as she sat down close by in; but the fiat
of separation, the thoughts of a perilous voyage, a visit
to an almost desolate island, and the impossibility of
receiving regular letters, so crowded upon her all at
one, that it was a strong effort to speak at all.
 No, dcarest; for what was the use of tormcnting you
will disagreeable anticipations, when there really might
have been no foundation for them. The last accounts
fromSamboe were, as you know, received nearly two years
ago, telling me that Frederic WIlson was dcnd, but that
his son had been received as his successor in the
ministry and as civil guardian of the island, with, if
possible, a still greater degree of popularity that his
predecessors, from his having been educated in Denmark.
His parents had lived on strained means to give him
superior advantages, which, as it proves, he would have
been much better without. The vices he has required
have far outrun the advantages. His example, and that
of a band of idle irregular.spirits who have joined him,
has not only scandalized the simple people bnt disturbed
their homesteads, brought contention and misery, and,
in some cases, bloodshed; so that in point of social and
domestic position, I fear they had sunk lower than
when my grandfather first sought the island. The

perhaps, but weakly, shrunk from informing against

him; but her brother, the clergyman of Foster,
has at length taken upon himself to do so, clearly
stating that nothing but personal interference and some
months' residence amongst them will elect a reforma-
tion; and that the run is the more to bc regretted, as
the little island has been for more than half a century
the admiration not only of its immediate neighbours,
but of all who have changed to labour oF its const.
He states, too, that if properly directed and not exposed
to the contagion of large cities, as his brother has been,
poor Wilson's younger son, now a boy of eleven, may
become as worthy and judicious a pastor as his father
and grandfather, and to keep the office in his family, as
my grandfather was so desirous of doing. The question
is, how is this boy to be educated on the island, and
whom can I find to take the ministry meanwhile.''
`And must your own residence there be very long,''
inquire MIrs. Hamilton, still in that quiet tone, but
er lip quivered.
It depends so entirely on whom i can get to aecom-
pay me, dearest. I must set MIr. HOward and Morton
to work to find me some simple-minded, single-hearted
individual, who will regard this undertaking in the
same missionary spirit as the elder Wilson did. If I
am happy cough to succeed in this, I hope a year
or somewhat less, will be the farthest limit of our
separation.''

replied M. HAmilton, trying to smile, and folding his
nrm fondly round his wife, he kissed the cheek which
had become pale from the effort to restrain her feelings.
 It is indeed an unexpected and a painful trial, and,
as is generally the case with our rebellious spirits, I feel
as if it would have been better borne at any other period
than the present. We had so positioned out this year,
had so anticipated gratifying Caroline by introducing
her to the so long and so eagerly anticipated pleasures
of London next January, that I cannot bear to think of
her disappointment.''
`And our boys, too, they say it is so strange to be
without their father, eren in college term; what will it
be when they come home for the long vacation, to
which we have all so looked forward? but this is all
weakness, my own dear husband; forgive me, I am only
rendering your duty more difficult,'' she added, rising
her head from his shoulder, and smiling cheerfully, een
while the tears glistened in her ees.  I must tr and
practise my ow lesson, and believe the term of sepa-
ration will really pass quickly, interminable as it now
seems. We have been so blessed, so guarded from the
bitter pang of even partial separation for twenty years,
that how dare I mum the trial has content? It is
God's pleasure, dearest Arthur, though it seems like the
work of man, and as Is we can endure it.''

that so largely mingled with it. Aud bitter disap-

absence.''
MIr. and MIrs. IInmilton remained some hours to-
gather that morning in earnest conversation. All of
individual regret was conquered for the sake of the
other: its expression at least, not its feeling; but they
understood each other too well, too loudly, to need
words or complaints to prove to either how intensely
painful was the very thought of separation. To elude
the performance of a duty which many persons, un-
able to enter into the hope of affecting good, would,
no doubt, pronounce uixotic-for what could the
poor inhabitants of Samboe be to him?-never
entered either Mr. or MIrs. Hamilton's mind. He
was not one to neglect his immediate duties for dis-
tant ones; but believed and acted on the belief, that
both could be united. His own large estate, its va-
riots farms, parishes, and villages, were so admirably
ordered, that he could leave it without the smallest
scruple in the hands of his wife and steward. Though
interested in, and actually assisting in the political
movements of his country, he was still, as from his
youth he had firmly resolved to be, a free independent
Englishman; bound to no party, but respected by all;
retaining his own principles unshaken as a rock,
though often and often his integrity had been tried by
court bribes and dazzling offers. And yet, rare blend-
in with such individual feelings, Arthur Hamilton

principles of others, however they might differ from

his own, and found excuses for them, which une
others could. That he should give up all the comforts,
the luxuries, the delights of his peculiarly happy home,
to encounter several months' sojourn in a bleak, half-
civilized island, only in the hope of restoring and en-
during moral and religious improvement to a small
colon of human beings, whose sole claim upon him
was, that they were immortal as himself, and that they
had done a kindness to his grandfather more than half
a century back, was likely to, and no doubt did, excite
the utmost astonishment in very many circles; but not
a super, not a word seeming to whisper good should
be done at home before sought abroad, could find a
moment's resting-place near Arthur Hamilton's name.
For half an hour after Mrs. Hamilton quieted her
husband she remained aloe, and when she rejoined
ler family, though she might have been a shade paler
than her wont, she was as cheerful in conversation and
earnest in manner as usual. That evening MIr. Hamilton
informed his children and Miss Harcourt of his intended
departure, and consequent compelled change of plan.
kEmmeline's burst of sorrow was violent and union-
trollcd. Caroline looked for a minute quite bewildered,
and tuen hastening to her father, threw one arm round
his neck, exclaiming, in a voice of the most affectionate
sincerity, ' Dear apa, what shall we do without you
for such a long time?''
MIy dear chill I thank you for such an affectionate
thought; believe me, the idea of our wishes being
postponed has pained me as much as anything else in
this unpleasant dut.''

My wishes postponed, Papa-what do you mean ?''
IIave you quite forgotten our intended plans for
next January, my love?-MIy absence must alter them,''
For an moment an expression of bitter disappoint-
ment clouded Caroline's open eountenance.
Indeed, Papa, I had forgotten it; I only thought of
your going away for so many months. It is a great
disappointment, I on, and I dare say I shall feel it
still more when January comes; but I am sure parting
tro you must be a still greater trial to MIamma, than
any such disappointment ought to be to me; and,
indeed, I wiLl try and beer it as uncomplainingly and
cheerfully as she does.''
Her father almost involuntarily drew her to his heart,
and kissed her two or three times, without speaking;
and Caroline was very glad he did so, for when she
1looked up again, the tears that would come at the first
thought of her disappointment were bravely sent back
again; and she tried to cheer Emmeline, by assuring
her she neer could be like her favorite heroines of
romance, if she behaved so very much like a child;
taking the opportunity when they retired for the night,
to say more seriously-
bDenr Emmeline, do try and be as likely as you
always are. I am sure poor Mamma is suffering very
much at the idea of Papa's leaving us, though she will
not let us see that she does, and if you give way so, it
will make her more uncomfortable still.''
Emmeline promised to try; but her disposition, quite
as susceptible to sorrow ns to joy, and not nearly as
firm as her sister's, rendered the promise very difficult

to full. It was her first sorrow, and MIrs. Hamilton
watched her with some anxiety, half fearful that she
had been wrong to shield her so carefully from anything
like grief; it, when it came, she should prove unequal
to its firm and uncomplaining endurance. Ellen had
been out of the room when MIr. Hamilton had first
spoken ; and engaged in shooting Emmeline when she
re-entered and the nes was communicated to her, he
did not observe anything particular in her one of
receiving it. But MIrs. Hamilton was so struck with the
expression of her countenance, which, as she tried some-
what inherently to utter regrets, took the place of its
usual calm, that she looked at her several minutes in
bewilderment; but it passed again, so completely, that
she was angry with herself for fancying anything u-
common. Caroline, however, had remarked it too, and
she could not help observing to Miss Harcourt, the first
time they were alone-
You will say i am always faneyiug something extra-
ordinary, MIss Harcourt; but Ellen certainly did look
pleased last night, when Mamma told her of Papa's
intended departure.''
Tue expression must have been something extra-
ordinary for you to remark it at all,'' replied Miss
Harcourt; `nobody but Mrs. Hamilton, hose pene-
traction is out of the common, can ever read anything
on Ellen's face.''
` And it was or that very reason I looked again, and
Mamma noticed it too, and was surprised, though she
did not say anything. If she really be pleased, she is

I never shall understand Ellen, I believe; but I do hope
MIamma will ever discover that she is not exactly that
which her affection believes her.''
 1ray do not talk so, my dear Caroline, or I shall

own feelings. lIar conduct with regard to the disap-
appearance of her allowance, the wholly unsatisfactory
account of its expenditure, even every month, for slc

than I can tell you, the very thing you have expressed.
But all this is very wrong; we have relieved each other
by a mutual acknowledgment, and now let us never
revert, even in though, if possible, to the subject,''
Caroline willingly aequiesced, for it was far from
ugrcecable. Mr. IInmilton's preparations meanwhile
rapidly progressed. He imparted his wishes for a
companion willing to remain in the island, till young
Wilson should be prepared for the ministry, both to MIr.

encounter the stormy seas between Scotland and Feroc,

means of regular communication between himself and
the beloved inmates of his home. Will, in Caithness,

addressed. Every ten days or fortnight communications
were to be sent there and the Siren, after conveying
him to Feron, was regularly to ply between Sambre and
Wick, bringing from the latter place to Mr. Hamilton
the various letters that had accumulated there, should
unfavorable winds hae lengthened the voyage, and for-
wearing his throngs that post to his home. By this
means, he hoped to hear and be heard of regularly; an
intense relief, if it really could be so accomplished, to
his wife.
As soon as a ship, a competent captain, mate, and
crew were obtained, MIr. Hamilton set off for Oxford
and London, wishing in the latter place to see his friend
Grahame, and in the former to pass a few days witln
his sons, who, knowing nothing of his summons, received
him with unbounded delight. Their regret, when they
heard the cause of his visit, was as great as their joy
had been. Percy, in a desperate fit of impatience, wished
the little island and all its concerns at the bottom of
the sea, the best place for such unruly disagreeable
people; and e as only sobered when his father put
before him that, though it must be a very heightened
individual disappointment, it was the greatest conform
to him, to think that they would both be with their
mother and sisters the first few months of his absence.
Percy instantly altered his tone.
t You are quite right, my dear father; I was very
selfish not to think of it. Trust me for making my
dearest mother as cheerful and as happy as I can.
You don't know what a guardian angel the thought of
her lore has been to me in temptation; and as for

him to take exercise and recreation, when he thought
me a great bore, the word mother, made him yield at
once.''
And IIerbort's kindling eye and chooek bore testimony
to the truth of his brother's words. HIs only feeling
and exclamation had been, if he might but accompany
his father, and save him all the trouble he could;
allowing, however, its impossibility, when the circle-
stances of is still delicate health and the necessity for
interrupted study, were placed before him.
That visit to Oxford was a proud one for Mr. HAmilton.
His sons held that place in the estimation of the pro-
lessons, superiors, and their fellow-collegians which
their early influences had promised, and which, as the
sons of Arthur HAmilton, seemed naturally their own.
Percy could so combine firmness in principle, uubending
rectitude in conduct with such an spirit of fun and
enjoyment, as rendered him the prime mover of all
sports at Oxford, as he had been at Norwood; and
Herbert, though so gentle andretiring (as, until Percy's
spirit was roused to shield him), gained in many nick-
names and many petty annoyances, silently and insen-
silly won his way, and so more with the thoughtless,
thc faithful, and even the faulty, as at length to gain
him the privilege of being allowed to do just as he
liked, and win by his extraordinary talents the admi-
ration and love of all the professors with whom he
was thrown.
Morton had promised to introduce a person to MIr.

his astonishment, when he found it was MOrton himself,

earuestness, such single-mindedness of purpose, that every
objection which, for horton's on sake, MIr. hamilton so
strenuously brought forward, was overruled; and, after
lengthened interest, matters were arranged to the entire
satisfaction of both parties. The idea of the companion-

scquiescence filled the whole heart of the young mis-

suggested many little things, which, in the agitation of
his hasty summons, had escaped his friends, and his
whole being seemed transformed from despondency and
restlessness to energy and lope. Engrossed as he was,
MIr. Hamilton's usual thought for others had not
deserted him, and he remarked that one of his house-
old, Robert Langford, so often mentioned, appeared
to linger in the library after morning and evening
service, as if anxious to speaks to him, but failing in
courage so to do. Ie thought, too, that the young man

of speaking before his departure, if he wishes it, Mlr.
HAmilton summoned him to arrange, write a list, and
pack some books, which Morton had selected to take
with him. For some time Robert pursued his work in per-
severing silence, but at length fixed his eyes on his master
with such bescecling earnestness, that MIr. HAmilton
inquired the matter at once. It was some time before
the young man could sufficiently compose himself to
speak with any coherency, but at last MIr. Hamilton
gathered the following details.
About five weeks previous (the first day of June) he
had been trusted, as he had very often before been,
by his master, with certain papers and law articles to
convey to Plymouth, and with a pocket-book containing
thirty pounds, in two men and two fie sound notes,
which he had orders to leave at some poor though
respectable families, whom MIr. Hamilton was in the
habit of occasionally assisting, though they were out
of his own domains. he morning he was to have
started on this expedition a cousin, whom he had
always regarded as a brother, came unexpectedly to see
him. He had just arrived at Plymouth from a four
ends' residence with his regiment in Ireland, and
Robert's glee was so great, as to require reiterated com-
lands from the stewart to take care of the papers, and
not stay at his mother's cottage, where he was to take
his cousin, later than the afternoon. He lingered so
long before he set off from Wood, that hc gathered
up all the papers as quickly as he could, forgot his
principal charge, so fa at least as not to look to the
secure fastening of the pocket-book, and hastened ith

his cousin through the brushwork and glade we have
before mentioned, to his mother's cottage. It was very
hot, and the young men, heated and in cages converse-
tion, took off their coats, threw them loosely over their
arms, and proceeded on their walk without them, much
too engrossed with each other to be aware that, as they
carried their coats, it was the easiest and most natural
thing possible for all the smaller contents of their
pockets to fall out, and if not missed directly, from the
binding and rugged wood paul, not likely to be found
again. A draught of cider and inlf an hour's rest at
MIrs. Langford's cottage sufficiently revived overt to
resume his coat ; he satisfied himself that his packet of
papers was secure, and, as he imagined from the feel of
another pocket, the pocket-book also.
What, then, was his consternation, when he approached
the first house at which he was to leave ten pounds of
the money, about twenty miles from Norwood, to discover
that the pocket-book was gone and that which, by its
feel, he believed to have been in, an old card-case, that
his young master Percy ad laughingly thrown at him
one day after failing in his endeavor to emblazoned it,
the sticky materials he had used causing it to adhere
to whatever it touched, and so preserving it in Robert's
pocket, when almost all the other things had fallen out.

thoughtlessness again and again, and would have re-
traced his steps imneliatcly, but the papers with
which he was entrusted had to be delivered at Plymouth
by a certain born, and he could not do it. The intense
heat of the day gae place in the evening to a tre-
vendors storm of thunder and lightning, wind and
very heavy rain, which last continued unabated through
the night. IIe returned home, or rather to his mother's
cottage, the next day, in a state of mind little removed
from distraction; searched the path he had traversed
with his cousin in every direction, but only succeeded
in finding some worthless trifles, and the pocket-book
itself, but open and city; but at a little distance from
it one of3 note. In an instant he remembered that in
his hurry he had failed to see to its proper fastening: if
he had, all would have been right, for the wind and
rain would hardly have had power to open it, and is-
perse its contents. Hour after hour he passed in the
vain search for the remainder; the storm had rendered
the path more intricate; the rotund was slimy, and
quantities of dried sticks and broken branches and
leaves almost covered it. IIe told his tale to his mother
in the deepest distress; what was he to do? She
advised him to tell the steward the whole story, and to
request him to keep back the sum she was in the habit
of receiving quarterly, till the whole amount could be
repaid. obert obeyed her, but with most painful re-
reluctance, though even then he did not imagine all the
misery his carelessncss would entail upon him. Morris,
as was natural, was exceedingly displeased, cannot only
reproved him very severely, but let fall suspicions as to

61
the truth of his story: he knew nothing of his cousin,
he said, and could not say what company he might have
been led into. If the notes had fallen out of his pocket
during his walk, they must be found; it was all nonsense
that the wind and rain could so hae scattered and
annihilated them, as to remove all trace of them. He
would not say anything to his master, because it would
only annoy him, and the charities he would give him-
self, not from Mrs. Langford's allowance, but from
Robert's own wages, which he should certainly stop till
the whole sum was paid; he should take care how he
entrusted such a responsible office to him again.
Robert was at first indignant, and violent in his pro-
stations of the truth of his story; but as it got wind in
the servants' hall, as he found himself suspected and
shunned by almost all, as days merged into weeks, and
there was no trace of the notes, and Morris and Ellis
both united in declaring that, as no strangers passed
through that part of the park, if found they must have
been heard of, the young man sunk into a state of the
most gloomy despondency, longing to tell 1is and
master the whole tale, and yet, naturally enough,
shrinking from the dread of his suspicion of his honesty
as mare terrible than all the rest.
But MIr. HAmilton did not suspect him, and so as-
sued him of his firm belief in his truth and innocence,
that it was with great difficulty poor Robert refrained
from throwing itself at is feet to pour forth is
gratitude. IIc was so severely punished for his heed-
lessons, that his master would not say much about it,
and soon after dismissing him, summoned Morris, and

the boy who had grown up under his own eye from
infancy, and the son of such a mother. It wens very
distressing for MIrs. langford certainly, the old stcwnrl
allowed, and she looked sad enough; but it was no use,
he had tried and enough to prevent his suspicions,
but they would come. None but the servants and the
women and gardeners went that path, and if the notes
had been dropped there, they must have been found;
and it was a very hard thing for the other servants, as
none know who might be suspected of appropriating
them. IIis master was much too kind in his opinions,
but he most forgive him if he continued to keep a
sharp look out after the young man. MOrris was very
old, and somewhat opinionated; so all that his master
could succeed in, was to insist that he should only keep
back half of Robert's wages, till the sum was paid.
Take away the whole, and if he have been north-
namely lel into temptation, which I do not believe he has,
you expose him to it again,'' was his judicious command.
 It is all right he should return it, even though lost only
by carclessness; but I willing have him put to such straits
for want of a little money, as must be the case if you
deprive him of all his wages; and no, my good MOrris,
if you cannot in conscience repeat my firm opinion of this
law's innocence to the servants, I must do it myself.''
And that very evening after prayers, when the whole
household was assembled in the library, MIr. HAmilton ad-
dressed them simply and briefly, mentioning that Robert

did not deserve the suspicions attached to him, and
that his fellow-servants would all be acting more cha-
ritably and religiously if they believed his story, until
tley has had some strong proof to the contrary: he
could not, of course, interfere with private opinion; he
could only tell them his own and their lady's. IIe
acknowledged it was a very unpleasant occurrence, but
e begged them all to dismiss the idea that suspicion
could be attached to either of them; he felt too convinced,
that had any one of his household chanced to find the
issingnotes, they would at once have mentioned it to the
steward or housekeeper, more especially, since Robert's
loss had been known amongst them only a few days
after it had occurred. Appropriation, he need not tell
them, in such a case was theft, and of that in, he was
perfectly certain, not one present would be guilty. He
allowed that it would be much more satisfactory to have
the tangible proof of Robert's innocence by discovering
some trace of them; but it was not unlikely the heavy
wind and rain had destroyed the thin material of the
notes, or borne them into the bramble brushwood,
where it was scarcely possible they could be found.

could have little thought of any thing else; but MIrs.

CHAPTER IV.
THE BROKEN DESK.
TirE many secret wishes for an unfavorable wind,
that MIr. Hamilton might stay at Oakvood still a little
longer, were not granted, and he left his family the very
lay he had fixed, the l4th of July, just three weeks aftonr
his summons, and about ten days before his sons were
expected home. Without him Norwood was strange
indeed, but with the exception of Feminine, all seemed
determined to conquer the sadness and anxiety, which
the departure of one so beloved, naturally occnsioned.
Emmeline was so unused to anything like personal sor-
row, that she rather seemed to lubricate in its indulgence.
 Do you wish to both disappoint and displecase me,
my dear Emmeline?'' her mother said, one day, about
a week after her husband had gone, as she entered the
music-room, expecting to find her daughter at the harp,
but practising her instead, listless and dispirited on the
sofa.  Indeed, you will do both, if you give way to
this most uncalled-for gloom.''

it so. Am l selfish .'' sle repeated, her voice faltering
and her eyes filling fast with tears.
I hope not, my love; but if you do not try to shake
off this depression, we must believe youth e so. Your
father's absence is a still greater trial to Caroline that it is
to you, for it compels a very bitter disappointment, as well
as the loss of his society; and yet, though she feels both
deeply, she has exerted herself more than I ever saw her
do before, and so proves, more than any words or tears
could do, how much she loves both him and me.''
' And do you think I love you both, less than she
does?'' replied Emmeline, now fairly sobbing.
No, dearest; but I want you to prove it in the same
admirable manner. Do you think I do not feel your
father's absence, Lmmeline? but would you like to see
me as sad and changed as you are?''
Declined looked p in her face, for there was some-
thing in the one that appealed to her better feelings at
once. Throwing her arms round her, she sobbed-
 Dear Mamma, do forgive me. I see now I have
been very selfish and very weak, but I never, never can
be as firm and self-controlled as you and Caroline aro.''
' Do not say never, lore, or you will never try to be
so. I am quite sure you would not like to be one of
those weak, selfish characters, who lay all their faults,

disposition is naturally less strong and firm the your
sister's, but its more clastic, and still more joyous; and
so had younot too wally encouraged your very natural
sorry, you would have been scanned to throw it off, and
in the comfort such an cxertion would have brought to
us, fully recompensed yourself.''
``And if I ll try now?'
I shall be quite satisfied, densest; though I for you
will find it more difficult than had you tried a few days
ago. Confess that I am right. Did you not, after the
first two or three days, feel that you could have been
cheerful again, at least at times, but that you fancied
you had not felt sorry enough, and so increased both
sorrow and anxiety by determinedly dwelling on them,
instead of seeking some pursuit?''

tears half dried.  I did not know I felt so myself till
you putin before me, and now I know that I really did.
Was it very wrong ?''
I will answer your question by another, love. Did
you find such pertinacious indulgence of gloom, help
you to bring the object of your regret and anxiety, and
of your own grief before your Heavenly Father ?''
Emeline hesitated, but only for a minute, then
answered witli a crimson blush.
No, MIamma; I could not pray to God to protect
dear Papa, or to give me lIes blessing, half as earuestly
and bclicingly as when I was happier; the more I

then, dearest, is it necessary for me to answer your
former question? I sce by that conscious look that it is
not. You hae alas trusted my experience and affect-
tion, m kmmeline, trust then no, and try my plan.
Think of your dear father, whom you cannot love too
well, or whose compelled absence really regret too much;
but so think of him, as to pray continually in spirit to
your gracious Got, to have him always in His holy keep-
in, either on sea or land, in storm or calm, and so
prosper his undertaking, as to permit his return to us still
sooner than we at present expect. The very constant
prayer for this, will make you rest secure and happy in
the belief, that our God is with him wherever he is, as
He is with us, and to give you cheerfulness and courage
to attend to your daily duties, and conquer anything like
too selfish sorrow. Will you try this, love, even if
it be more difficult now, than it would have been a few
days ago?'
I will indeed, Mamma,'' and she raised her head from
her mother's shoulder, and tried to smile. wHEn you
first addressed re to-day, I thought you were almost harsh
and so cold-so you see een there I was thinking wrong
-and now 1 am glad, oh, so glad yon did speak to
me ''
`'And I know who will be glad too, if I have presented

checked, her most unusual gloom dispersed, Emmeline
obeyed with alacrity, and finding, when she had once
begun, so many things to get perfect for the gratification
of her brothers, that only three hours slipped away
quite unconsciously; and when Caroline returned from
a walk, she was astonished at the change in her sister,
and touched by the affectionate self-reproach with which
lmmeline, looking p in her face, acclaimed--
`` Dear Carolina, I have been so pettish and so cross to
you since Pnp left, that I am sure you must be quite
tired me; but I am going to be really a heroine now,
and not a sham sentimental one; and bear the pain of
Papa's absence as bravely as you do.''
And she did so; though at first it was, as her mother
had warned her, very difficult to compel the requisite
exertion, which for employment and cheerfulness, was
now needed; but when the ill is right, there is little after
of failure.
As each lay passed, so quickly merging into weeks,
that five had now slipped away since that fatal letter had
been sent to Edward, the difficulty to do as she had in-
tended, entreat MIrs. Langford to dispose of her trinkets
and water, became to Ellen, either in reality or seeming,
more and more difficult. Igor illness had confined her
to her room for nearly a week, md when she was
allowed to take the air, the state of nervous debility to
which it had reduced her, of course prevented hcr even

courage to visit their nurse, the request was granted
without any surprise, though to the very last moment
she feared one of her cousins or Miss IInrcourt would
offer to accompany her. They were all, however, too oc-
copied with and for Mlr., Hamilton, and she sought the
cottage, and there with such very evident rental agony,
besought MIrs. Langford to promise her secrecy and
said, that the widow, very much against her conscience,

of money she urged, and dared not appeal to her aunt.
Not during to say the whole amount which she so
urgently required at once, she had only brought with
her the antique gold cross and two or three smaller
ornaments, which has been amongst her mother's
trinkets, and a gold loeket Percy had given her.
Mrs. Langford was painfully startled. She had to widen
her promise comprised ncquiescenee and assistance in
any matter so very wrong and mysterious as this; and
she tried very argument, every persuasion, to prevail on
Ellen to confide all her difficulties to MIrs. HAmilton,
urging that if even she had done wrong, it could only
call for temporary displeasure, whereas the mischief of
her present proceeding might never come to an end,
and must be discovered at last; but Ellen was inexorable,
though evidently quite as miserable as she was firm,
and MIrs. Langford had too high an idea of the solemn
nature of a pledged word to draw back, or think of
betraying her. She said that of course it might be some
weeks before she could succeed in disposing of them all,
as to offer them altogether, or even at one place, would
be exposing herself to the most unpleasant suspicious.

Oe step was thus gained, but nearly a fortnight had
passed, and she heard nothing from the widow.
 Will they never come?'' exclaimed Emmeline, in
faithful impatience, one evening, about four days after
her conversation with her mother; `` it ust e past the
hour Perey named.''
 It still wants half an hour,'' replica MIrs. HAmilton;
adding, `` that unfortunate drawing, when will it succeed
in obtaining your undivided attention ?''
Certninlynot this evening, Mlamma; the only draw-
in I feel inclined for, is a sketch of my two brothers,
if they would only have the kindness to sit to me.''
Poor Percy,'' observed Caroline daily; `if you are
to be as restless as you have been the last hour, Emmcline,
he would not be very much flattered by his portrait.''
Now that is very spiteful of you, Caroline, and all
because I do not happen to be so quiet and sober as yo
nrc; though I am sure all this morning, that MInimum
thought by your unusually long absence that you were
having a mostpersevering practice, you were only collect-

playing them over, instead of your new music.''
And what if I did, Lmmcline?'

have so disageeably read, studied, worked, just as usual,
to make one believe yo neither thought nor cared any-

she may have settled to her usual pursuits, and you

dem her as loving her brothers less.''
But you will condemn me as an idle, unsteady, hair-

nt her mother's feet, andlooking early and fondly in her
face. Then do let me have a fellow-sufferer, for I can-
not staud condemnation alone. eLlen, do pnt away that
everlasting sketch, and be idle and unsteady tool''
 It won't do, kEmmmy; Ellen has been so perseveringly
industrious since her illness, that I should rather
condemn her for too much application than too great
idleness. But you really have been stopping too long
this warm evening, my loe,'' she added, observing, as
Ellen, it seemed almost involuntarily, looked up at her
cousin's words, that her cheeks were flushed almost
painful. Oblige Emmcline this ouse, and be as idle
as she is: come and talk to me, I have scarcely heard
word from you to-day; of have been more silent than
ever, I think, since your uncle left us; but i must have
no gloom to greet your cousins, Ellen.''
There was no.rejoinder to these kind and playful
words. Ellen did indeed put aside her drawing, but
instead of taking a seat near her aunt, wich in forme
days she would have been only too happy to do, she
walked to the furthest window, and denouncing herself in
its deep recess, seemed determined to hold communion
with no one. Miss HArcourt was so indignant, as
scarcely to be able to contain its expression. Caroline
looked astonished and provoked. Emeline was much

anything else but her brothers. Mrs. HAmilton was
more grieved and hurt than llen had scarcely ever made
her feel. Secral ties before in the last month, she
had fancied there was something unusual in her manner,
but the many anxieties and thoughts which had cngrossed
her since her husband's summons and his departure had
prevented anything, till that evening, but momentary
surprise. Lmmeline's exclamation, that she was quite
sure she henry the trampling of horses, and that it must
be Percy, by the hello way he rode, prevented any
remark, and brought them all to the window; and she
was right, for in a few minutes a horseman emerged
from some distant trees, urging his horse to its utmost
speed, waving his cap in all sorts of faithful gesticula-
tions over his head, long before he could be quite sure
that there was anybody to see him. Another minute,
and he had lung the reins to Robert with a laughing
greeting, and spring p the long flight of steps in
two bounds, was in the sitting-room and in the arms of
his mother, before either of his family imagined he could
have had even time to dismount.

but sure, degrees this painful conviction pressed itself
on the minds of the whole party, even to the light-

utterly incomprehensible, that she declared it must be

heads must be a little turned.

It was, indeed, no fancy; but little could these young

was matter of speculation or grief to them, was almost
madness in its agony of torture to Ellen; who, as weeks

MIrs. IInnilton could not answer, but-a very unusual
sign of weakness with her-tears of the most intense
princess poured down on the choice of her son, as
in his impcetuosity he knelt before her, and ended his
very unusual gray appeal, by the same loving
cnresses he was wont to lavish on her, in his infancy
and boyhood.
The letters from Mr. HAmilton, of course, greatly
increased the general hilarity, and the arrival of Ml.
Grahame's family about the same time, added fresh zest
to youthful enjoyment. In the few months she spent
at Moorlunds, Annie actually condescended to be agree-
able. Perey, and some of Perey's boyish friends, now
young men, as himself, were quite different to her usual
society, and as she very well knew the only way to win
Percy's even casual notice was to throw off her affect-
tion and superciliousness as much as possible, she would
do so, and be pleasing to an extent that surprised
MIrs. Hamilton, who, always inclined to judge kindly,
hoped more regarding annie than she had done yet.
Little could her pure mind concede that, in addition to
the pleasure of flirting with Perey, Annie acted in this
manner actually to throw her off her guard, and to
give her a wider field for her machinations when
Caroline should enter the London world; a time to
which, from her thirteenth year, she had secretly looked
as the opportunity to make Caroline so conduct her-
self, as to cover her mother with shame and misery,
and bring her fine plans of education to failure and
contempt.

 Were is your water, Ellen? and why, if you are
not wearing it, do you make us suppose you are?'' in-
interrupted Mrs. HAmilton, startled out of all idea that
Ellen was changed only in fancy.
Ellen was silent, and, to Percy's imagination, so sul-
lenny and violently so, that he became indignant.
 Did you hear my mother speak to you, Allen why
don't you answer ?''
`Because I thought my water was my own to do what
I Liked with, to wear or to put away,'' was the reply;
over neither words or one of which, had she at that
moment any control, for in her agonized terror, she did
not in the least know what she said.
How dare you answer so, Ellen? Leave the room,
or ask my mother's pardon at one,'' replied Percy,
is eyes flashing with such unusual anger, that it terri-
fied her still more, and under the same kind of spell
she was turning to obey him, without attempting the
apology he demanded.
`Sta, Ellen; this extraordinary conduct must not
go on any longer without notice on my part. I have
borne with it, I fear, too long already. Leave us, my
dear Percy; I would rather speak with your cousin
alone.''
I fear it will be useless, mother; what has come
over Ellen, I cannot imagine, but I never saw such an

What passed in the interview, which lasted more than
an hour, to one knew; but to the watchful eyes of er
affectionate children, there were traces of very unusual
disturbance on MIrs. Hamilton's expressive countenance
when she rejoined them; and the dark rim round Ellen's
eyes, the deadly pallor of her cheeks and lips, seemed
to denote that it had not been deficient in suffering to
her; though not one sign of penitence, one word of
acknowledgment that she was, and had been for some
weeks, in error, by her extraordinary conduct-not been

had not a gleam of hope to urge her on. Her conclude-
ing words were these-

convinced; what it is time will reveal. I give you

end of a month, I find you persisting in the same course
of rebellion and defiance, regardless alike of your duty
to your God and to me, I shall adopt soe measures to
compel submission. I had hoped to bring up all my
children under my own eye and by my ow efforts;
but if I am not permitted so to do, I know my duty
too well to shrink from the alternative. You will no
longer remain user my care; somc severe guardian
and more rigid discipline may bring you to a sense of
your duty. I advise you to think well on this subject,
Ellen; you know me too well, I think, to imagine that
I speak in mere jest.''

had intended reply, there was no time for it. But she
could not have spoken. Go from Norwood, and in

than the lingering torture she was ten enduring-

of indifference, crept over her. She would hare con-

being as light-hearted as his young master himself, to
gravity and host gloom, for the conviction of his
master and mistress as to his innocence could not cheer
him, while suspicion against him still actuated Morris,
and many of the other servants, would have called the
young men's attention towards him at once. The
various paths and glades between the Hall and Mrs.
Langford's cottage had been so searched, that unless the
storm had destroyed them or blog the notes very far
away, it seemed next to impossible, that they could not
be found. Mr. Hamilton knew the number of each
note, had told them to his wife, and gave notice at his
banker's, that though he did not wish them stopped, he
should like to know, if possible, when they had passed.
No notice of such a thing had been sent to Soaked,
and it seemed curious that, if found and appropriated,
they should not yet have been used, for ten weeks had
now slipped away since their loss, and nearly in
since the letters had been sent to Edward and his
captain, answers to which had not yet been received;
but that was nothing remarkable, for Edward seldom
wRote above once in three or four months.,
It was nearing the end of August, when one after-

in a sail up the Dart, though it gd been a long pro-

could not help fancying it was to prevent the chance of
being any time alone with her. There had been no
change in her manner, except a degree more care to
control the disrespectful or pcttishanswer ; but nothing
to give hope that the spirit was changing, and that the
hidden error, whatever it might be, would be known-
legged and atoned. MIrs. HAmilton was serving her own
mind for the performance of the alternative she had
placed before her niece; passing many a sleepless night
in painful meditations. If to send her from Norwood
were necessary, would it produce the effect she wished,
with whom she could place her, and what satisfactory rea-
son she could assign for doing so. Sc knew there would
be a hundred tongues to cry shame on her for sending
her orphan niece from her roof, but that was but one
scarcely-tasted bitter drop in the many other sources of
anxiety. ut still these were but her nightly sorrows;
she might have been paler when she rose, but though
hcr children felt quite sure that Ellen was grieving her
exceedingly, her cheerful sympathy in their enjoyments

MOrris left her at six o'clock, all his business so
satisfactorily accomplished, that the old man was quite
happy, declaring to Ellis, he had always thought his
mistress unlike any one else before; but such a clear
head for reducing difficult accounts and tangled affairs

that she did not wish to be more explicit, Herbert took
his book, and somewhat sorrowfull left her.
Ten minutes more and the massie door unclosed
again, but no step advanced, for the intruder remained
rooted where the door had closed. It was a very large
and lofty room, with an arched and gothic roof, of
black and fretted oak, the walls and chimney-piece of
the same material and most elaborate workmanship. A
sort of dais, remnant of olden times, divided the upper
part of the room by two or three steps from the lower.
On this dais was the raised reading-desk of supcrbly
cared oak, at which MIr. Hamilton officiated morning
and evening, and two library tables of more modern
workmanship stood on each side, but rather lower
town. Except the massive taken chairs and couches,
and three or four curious tables scattered about, and
the well filled bookcases, forming, to the height of five
feet, the order as it were of the fretted woodwork of
the walls, and filling up the niches formed by the win-

lows, the lower part of the hall, two thirds of the length,
was comparatively unoccupied, showing its vast space
and superb roof to still greate advantage. The mag-
ificently stained windows, one on the dais, a deep
oriel, threw such subdued light into the room, as
accorded well with its other appointments; but as
evening advanced, gave it that sort of soft holy light,
which always impresses the spirit with a species of
awe.
We do not think it was that feeling alone which so
overpowered the second intruder, as to arrest her spell-
bound on the threshold. Mrs. Hamilton was seated at
one of the tables on the dais nearest the oriel window,
the light from which fell full on her, giving her figure,
though she was seated naturally enough in one of the
large, maroon velvet, taken chairs, an unusual effect of
dignity and command, and impressing the terrified
belolder with such a sensation of awe, that had her life
depended on it, she could not for that one minute have
gone forward; and even when desired to do so by the
wORds-
I desired your presence, Ellen, because I wished to
speak to you; come here without any ore delay,''-how
she walked the whole length of that iuterminable room,
and stood facing her aunt, she never knew.
MIrs. HAmilton for a full minute did not speak, but
she fixed that searching look, to which we have one
before alluded, upon Ellen's face; and then said, in a
tone, which, though very low and calm, expressed as
much as that earnest look-

For a moment Ellen stood as turned to stone, as
white and rigid-the nest she had sunk down with a
wild bitter cry at Mrs. Hamilton's feet, and buried her
face in her hands.
Is it true-can it be true-that you, offspring of
my own sister, car to me, cherished by me as my own
child,-you hae been the guilty one to appropriate,
and conceal the appropriation of money, which has
been a source of distress by its loss and the suspicion
thence proceeding for the last seven weeks -that you

and it by either word nor sign betray remorse or

of clearing himself, and stand calmly, heellessly by-

that all was not right within-Ellen, in this be

that her slight frame shook as with an ague; ``thank
God, that it is known. I dared not bring down the
punishment on myself, but I can hear it.''

it carried no conviction with it.

cially alone. If you wanted to see her, why did you

 Then answer me, Ellen, this moment, and distinctly;
for what purpose were you seeking MIrs. Langford's
cottage by that forbidden path, and when?''
eI wanted money, and I went to ask her to take
my trinkets-my watch, if it must be-and dispose of
them as I had read of others doing, as miserable as I
was, and the wind blew the notes to my very hand, and
I used them. I was mad then-I have been made since,
I believe; but I would have returned the whole amount
to Robert, if 1I could but have parted with my trinkets
in time.''
To describe the tone of utter despair, thc reck-
lessons as to the effect her words would produce,
is impossible. Every word increased MIrs. Hamilton's
bewilderment and misery. To suppose that Ellen did
not feel was folly. It was the cry depth of wretched-

that I can scarcely believe I am addressing the child I

given of remorse and penitence-one hope of returning

large a sum, granted it came by the merest chance into
your hand; dark as is the additional sin of concealment
when an innocent person was suffering,-something still
darke more terrible, must be concealed behind it, or
you would not, could not, continue thus obdurately
silent. I can believe that under some heavy pressure
of misery, some strong excitement, the sum might have
been used without thought, and that fear might ave

Oh, that I could'' was the reply in such bitter
anguish, MIrs. Hamilton actually shuttered. :`But I

condemn me to the severest, sharpest suffering; I wish

tones-I cannot bear them. It was because I know
what a wretch I am, that I have so shunned you, l

 Dare not'' repeated Mrs. HAmilton, more and

wild words and agonized manner had produced, adopt-
ing greater sheerness.  You dare commit a sin, from
which the lowest of my household would shrink in
horror, and yet tell me you are not make the only
atonement, give me the only proof of real penitence, I

and will not pass with me. There can be no reason
for this fearful obduracy, not even the consciousness of
greater guilt, for I promise forgiveness, if it be possible,
on the sole condition of a full confession. Once more,
will you speak? Your hardwood will be utterly useless,
for you cannot hope to conquer me; and if you permit
me to leave you with your conduct still clothed in this
impenetrable mystery, you will compel me to adopt
measures to subdue that defying spirit, as will expose
you and myself to intense suffering, but which must
force submission at last.''

use to which it was applied, the reason of your choosing

of heavier sins than may be the case in reality. Listen
to me, eLlen ; its more than time this interview should
cease, but I will give you one chance more. It is now

and said it on the table-`I will remain here one half

have passed away, and you will consent to give me the

Ellen rose slowly and painfully, and seating herself
at the table, some distance from her aunt, leaned her
arms upon it, and buried her face within them. Never
Before, and never after, did half an hour appear so
interminable to either Mrs. HAmilton or Allen. It was
well for the firmness of the former perhaps, that she could
not read the hcnrt of that young girl, even if the cause of
its anguish had been still concealed. Again and again

for Edward, but then clear as held before her in letters of
fire she read every word of her brother's desperate letter,
particularly ` Breathe it to my uncle or aunt, for if
she knows it, he will, and you will never see me more.''
Her mother, rallied as death, seemed to stand before her,
freezing confession on her heart and lips, looking at
her tlreateningly, as she had so often seen her, as if the
very thought were guilt. . The rapidly advancing tvi-
light, the large and lonely room, all added to that fearful
illusion, and if kEllen did succeed in praying, it was with
desperate fervor for strength, not to betray her
brother. If ever there were a martyr spirit, it was
enshrined in that young frail form.
But how could MIrs. Hamilton imagine this IIow

eager Edward, of whom captain, officers, and crew

Was it not more natural that he should not enter the
incongruous and painful thoughts floating through
her brain, save as her last resource, by his influence to
obtain the truth from Ellen? The more she thought,
the more agonizing her thoughts became; what could
induce this determined silence but a conviction of
deeper guilt, and what could that guilt he? The most
terrible suspicions crossed her mind; she had heard,
though she had scarcely believed in them, of entangle-

choosing that forbidden path which was never by any
chance trolden by the family or their friends, her
constant desire lately not to join them in their ex-
versions, preferring, and often finding some excuse to
remain along-all came to Irs. HAmilton's mind with
such an overpowering sensation of dread and misery,
that the worst guilt Ellen could have avowed would

such obdurate silence in one so young, generally sa
yielding, could and must conceal nothing but still more
fearful sin. The darkness which had gathered round
them, save the brightening light of the harvest moon,
suddenly awakened her to the lapse of time. The
moonlight fell full on the face of the watch, which was
a repeater. It wanted but three minutes more, and
Mrs. Hamilton watched the progress of the and with
such sickening dread, that when it reached the hour,
she had scarcely strength to strike it, and so gie
notice-for words she had none-that the hour of grace
had passed. But she conquered the powerlessness, and
those soft chimes which, when Ellen first came to Oak-
wood, had been such a constant source of childish
wonderland ilelight, now rang in her ears louder, coarser,
more fenrfully distinct than even those of the ancient
time-piece in the hall, which at the same moment rang
out the hour of light.

The sounds ceased, and with heightened dignity, but in
perfect silence, MIrs. Hamilton rose, passed her niece,
and had nearly reached the door, when she paused, and
turned towards Ellen, as if irresolute. Ellen's eyes had
watched her as in fascination, and the pause endowed
her with just sufficient power to spring forward, fling
herself at her aunt's feet, and clasping her knees
with all her little remaining strength, passionately im-
lore-
Aunt Emmeline, Aunt Emmeline, speak to me but
one word, only one word of kindness before you go. I
do not ask for mercy, there can be none for such a
wretch as I am; I will beer without one complaint, one
murmur, all you may inflict-you cannot be too severe.
Nothing can be such agony as the utter loss of your
affection; I thought the last two months, that I feared
of so much, that it was all fear, no love, but now, now
that you know my in, it has all, all come back, to
make me still more wretched,'' and before Mrs. Hamilton
could prevent, or was in the least aware of her intention,
Ellen had obtained possession of one of her hands, and
was covering it with kisses, while hor whole frame
shook with those conulsed but completely fearless
sobs.

me the proof that it is such agony to lose my alec-
tion, that you do love me as you profess, and that

Ellen made no answer, and MIrs. Hamilton's newly-

raised hopes spanish; she waited full two or three
minutes, then gently disengaged er hand and dress
from Ellen's still convulsive grasp; the door closed with
a sullen, seemingly unwilling sound, and Ellen was
alone. She remained in the same posture, the same
spot, till a vague cold terror so took possession of her,
that the room seemed filled with ghostly shapes, and all
the articles of furniture suddenly transformed to things
of life and springing up with the wild fleet step of fear,
she paused not till she found herself in her own room,
where, flinging herself on her bed, she buried her face
on her pillow, to shut out every object-of, how she
longed to shut out thought
It was such a different scene, such a fulness of
innocent joy, on which MIrs. Hamilton entered, that
though she thought herself served to control all
visible emotion, the contrast almost overpowered her;
knowing, too, that the fatal effects of one person's
sin must banish that innocent enjoyment, and would
fall on them all as some fearful, joy-destroying blow.
The room, one of the least spacious, was cheerfully
lighted, the urn hissing on the table, at which Caroline
as usual was presiding, only waiting for her mother's
appearance to satisfy Percy, who was loudly declaring
he was famished in two senses, for want of lus mother's
company, and of some restorative for his craving ap-
petite. IIe was logging on the sofa, playing with
Emmeline's slowing ringlets, as she sat on a low stool

strain as his fancy willed. Herbert and Miss HArcourt

even Percy and Emmeline, would pause involuntarily

long after a water-excursion, must have caused you to be
impatient in another sense.''
 Wat that we must be all famished? I assure you,
we are, and the loss of your society sharpened the pangs
of hunger. I owe Morris a grudge, and will certainly
sere him out one day, for detaining you so long when
I wanted you.''
It was not MOrris, that detained me,'' answered
MIrs. Hamilton, somewhat lurrielly. I had done with
him by six o'clock; but come, tell me something about
your excursion,'' she added, evidently anxious to elude
farther remark, and perceiving at once that MIss Harcourt
and Herbert both looked at her very anxiously.  How

flute sound on the water, Perey? Herbert, lI see, has

Her children eagerly entered on their day's enjoy-
ment-Herbert conquering his anxiety to emulate his
mother's calmness, but Miss Harcourt had been too
painfully startled by the unusual expression of forcibly-
controlled suffering on her friend's face, to do so with
any success. Nearly an hour, however, passed ani-
matedly as usual; each found so much to tell, and
Percy was in such wild spirits, that it was utterly is-
possible for there to be anything like a pause. Tea
had always been a favorite meal at Norwood, as bring-
in all the family together after the various business of
the day, and it continued to be so. They had lingered
over it as usul, when Caroline suddenly exclaimed-

her till this moment; how neglectful she will think usl
Do ring the hell, Percy, that we may send and let her

If she has no recollection of metal-time, I really

Perey's half-jesting half-earnest reply, for Ellen's
changed manner to his mother had made him more
angry with her, and for a longer time together than he
had ever been with anybody, especially a woman, in his
life. He stretched out his hand, however, to ring the
bell, but Mrs. HAmilton stopped him.

of almost anguish, that every one of that happy party
startled and looked at her with the most unfeigued alarm,
and Perc, every thought of west and joyousness checked,
threw his arms round her, exclaiming--
 MOther, dearest what has happened?-that in-
happy girl again. I am sure it is. Why do you not
cast her off from your heart at once; she will bring you
nothing but sorrow for all your loe.''
Perc, how can you be so harsh.-how unlike you''
exclaimed Emmcline, indignantly, as MIrs. Hamilton's
head for a few minutes of natural weakness sunk on her
son's encircling arm. e We have all given MIamma
trouble and pain enough one time or other, and what
would have become of us if she had cast us off and
Ellen has no mother, too-for shame ''

were times when he could quite throw off the boy.
This is no light or common matter to affect my
mother thus. Shall we send for MIr. Howard, mother?'
he continued, fondly; `'in my father's absence he is
your ahlest friend-we can only feel, not counsel.''
But there are times when feeling can aid in bringing
back control and strength, when counsel alone would
seem so harsh and cold, we can only veep before it;
and the fond affection of her children, the unusual
assumption of protecting manliness in Percy, so touch-
singly united with the deep respect that prevented the
least intrusive question as to the cause of her distress

though still holing his hand, as if its very pressure
was support, she was enabled calmly to relate the fatal
discovery of that evening. Its effect was, in truth, is
if a thunderbolt had fallen in the midst of them. An
execution, forcibly checked, but passionate as his na-
ture, burst from the lips of Percy, as he clasped his arm
close round his mother, as thus to protect her from the
misery he felt himself. HErbert, with a low cry of pain,
buried his face in his hands. Caroline, shocked and
bewildered, but her first thought for her mother, could
only look at, and fcl for hcr, quite forgetting that her
every prejudice against Ellen did indeed seem fulfilled.
Emmeline at first looked stunned, then sinking down at
Mrs. hamilton's feet, hid her face on her lap and sobbed
with such uncontrolled violence, that it might have

fearful disappointment.

 there does, indeed, seem no excuse for her conduct,
but if we ever should find that there is some extenuating
clause, how unhappy we shall be for having judged her
still more harshly than she deserved.''
It is impossible we can do that,'' muttered Percy,
continuing his angry walk.  Nothing, but guilt can
be the cause of her keeping anything from my mother.

her own previous penetration; ``but she cannot per-

 She has resisted every offer of kindness, my dear
child, and it is the difficulty as to what course to pursue,
to compel submission an confession, that so grimes
and perplexed me,''
 Let me seek MIr. FOrward, dearest Mother,'' an-
swerved Herbert; `` he is so good, so kind, even in his
severest judgments, that I really think Ellen will scarcely
be able to,persevere in her mistaken silence, if he speak

Mrs. HAmilton paused for some moments in thought.
I believe you are right, herbert. If I must ase
counsel out of my own family, I cannot go to a kinder,
wiser, or more silent friend. If the fearful shame which
I must inflict on Allen to-night of proving Robert's
innocence before my whole household, by the denounce-
ment of her guilt, has no fleet in softening her, I
will appeal to him.''
 Oh, Mamma, must this be-can you not, will you
not, spare her this?'' imnplorel Emmeline, clinging to
her mother, in passionate entreaty; ``it would kill me,
I know it would. Do not-do not expose her to such

his mother could reply.  Shame she has shamed us

But Emmeline's blue eyes neer more from her
mother's face, and Miss HArcourt, longing to spare Irs.
Hamilton the suffering of such a proceeding, tried to
persuade her to evade it, but she did not succeed.
 One word of confession-one evidence that her sin
originated in a momentary temptation, that it conceals
nothing darker-one real proof of penitence, and God
knows how gladly I would have spared myself and her;
but as it is, icy, Emmeline, do not make my duty

Few as these words were, the tone that spoke them
was enough. No more was said, and MIr. Hamilton
tried, but with very little success, to turn her children's
thoughts to other and pleasant things. Time seemed
to lag easily, and yet when the prayer bell sounded,

Ii excitement which reigned in the servants' hall,
after they had withdrawn in the most respectful silence

to realize relief in this proof of his own innocence, could
only pace the hall in agony, exploring his mad careless-

in fact, should be persisted in, till a full confession be
made. If that fail, my dear Mrs. HAmilton, your niece
should be banished from Norwood. She must not
remain here, a continual source of anxiety and misery to
you, and of successful hardwood to herself; but of that
there will be time enough to think when you have an
answer from Mr. Hamilton; his judgment from a dis-
dance may be wiser than ours on the spot, and irritated
as we are by such unaccountable obstinacy, in one we
have always thought almost too yielding.''
And it was this incomprehensible change of character
in seeming, that still ore perplexed MIrs. HAmilton,
and made her belief there must be some worse fault,
or dangerous entanglement, demanding such resolute
pertinacity in concealment.
Closely connected wi(h ElLis's private apartments, and
having neither inlet nor outlet, save through the short
passage, opening from her sitting-room, were two small
but not uncomfortable apartments, opening one into the
other, and looking out on a very pretty but quite unfre-
quented part of the park. They had often been used

habitable without any further preparation, except the
turing one into a sitting-room, which eLlis's active care
speedily accomplished. TIer mistress inspected them, at
her desire, suggested one or two additional comforts,
and then held a long confidential conversation with her.
She had such perfect confidence in her (for Ellis had
been from a child,-married, and become mother and
widow, and married her children,-all as in inmate of
the Hamilton family, and had held the confidential post
of housekeeper for sixteen years) that she did not hess-
tate onc moment to commit eLlen entirely to her care,
nt last till she could receive an answer about her from
her husband. She depended on her to watch over her
health, to see that she took daily exercise with her,
in those parts of the park where she was not likely to
attract notice, as being with her instead of with any
member of her family, and that she took her regular
deals; to be with her whenever she took them, and at
casual times in the day, not so as to remove the impress-
sion of solitude and disgrace, but to bc unable to watch

ter of a wise and watchful guardian. God in mercy
grant that her heart may be so softened, that you will
not fill tat painful position long.-And now to see
her.''
But Percy' s watchful care had so quietly interposed,
that his other found herself in their usual sitting-room.,
and in the midst of them all, before she could suck
Ellen; and when, with half reproach, she told him,
that she had still a most painful duty to accomplish,
therefore e ought not to have prevented it, he answered
impetuously-
Mother, you shall not see Ellen any more alone she
has made you miserable enough already, and each time
that she sees you, her deceitful appearance of remorse and
suffering, for they cannot be real, or she would speak,
but add to it; send for her here, and tell her your de-
vision before us all.''
And MIrs. HAmilton complied, for she felt as ifher firm-
ness would be less likely to fail, than if Ellen attempted
anything like supplication with her alone, But not a
word of supplication came. Ellen had answered the
summons, by quietly accompanying Ellis, who had been
sent for her, to her aunt's presence, pale, indeed, as
marble, but so fearless and still, as to seem unmoved.
An expression of actual relief stole over her features
and she heard her sentence, undisturbed even when told
that this would only be, till MIr. Hamilton's sentence
came; as if she continued silent until then, of course
whatever seeker measures he might dictate would be in-
distant obeyed. But when MIrs. Hamilton proceeded to

that his influence might awaken her to a sense of the

Ellen wildly implored-

turned hastily away, een his anger in part subdued,
and MIrs. Hamilton could scarcely reply.
I cannot grant your request, Ellen, for to refuse
it appears to me the only means of softening you. It
may be a full fortnight before I can write to Edward,
for we must receive letters first. If during that interval
you choose to give me the only proof of repentance that
can satisfy me, or bring the last hope of returning hap-

for her mistress's sake, Ellis led Ellen from the room,
and conducted her to the apartments assigned her, She
felt much too angry and annoyed at the pain and trouble
Ellen was giving her mistress, to since anything like
blindness towards her at first, but she had not been under
her care above a week before her feelings underwent a
complete change.
Suffering as she was enduring, more especially from
the position, that to every one of those she led (for
affection for each one of the family had now returned
with almost passionate violence) she must be an object
of hate and loathing, yet that her son was known, wasa

strange comfort in that; though she knew uo punishment
could be too severe for the in itself, and she prayed con-
distant to be enabled to beer it, and still not to betray
her brother; and the consequence of these petitions was
a calm, gentle, deeply submissive dcmeanour. Not a
murmur ever passed her lips, and Ellis scarcely ever
saw the signs of tears, which she longed for; for the
quiet, but fearfully intense suffering, Ellen's very evident
daily portion, alarmed her for its effect upon hcr always
delicate health. As yet, however, there was no outward
appearance of its filing, it rather bore up from the ces-
nation of the nervous dread, and constant terror which
she had endured before; and before Mlr. Hamilton's
letter arrived, an month after the fatal discovery, Ellis had
drawn her own conclusions, and her manner, instead of
being distant and cold, had become so excessively lind
and feeling, that the poor gil felt some heavy change
must be impending, she dared not look to the continue-
ance of such comfort.
But Mrs. HAmilton never saw her nice, save when
no words could pass between them; and she could not
judge as Ellis did. She could only feel, as each day
passed, without bringing the desired proof of sorrow
and amendment, more and more bewildered, and very
wretched. hough, for her children's sake, sle so con-
queued the feeling as, after the first week, to restore
chcerfulness, and promote the various amusements they
had all so enjoyed. Allen's disappcnrnnce had of course

they so constantly were; but her acknowledgment that
she had been disappointed in her, and that her conduct

would not allow her any social or domestic indulgence,
least for a time, satisfied the elder members. Annie,
for the first time, discovered that Caroline was her
match in cleverness, merely from her excessive truth and
simplicity, and that manure as she might, she could
not discover the smallest clue to this sudden mystery.
And Mary, for the first time, and on this one subject
alone, found HErbert and Emmeline impenetrably
reserved.
As soon as Mrs. Langford had been informed by her
son, at his mistress's desire, of the unanswerable proof
of his innocence, she hastened to the Hall, and requesting
a private interview with MIrs. hamilton, placed at once
in her hands all the trinkets and watch, with which she
had bccn at different times entrusted; related all that
and passed between her and MIss Tortescuc, the ex-
excessive misery she seemed to be enduring; and confessed
that the few pounds she had given her, as the sums
obtained by the sale of the trinkets, she had advanced
herself, having resolved that nothing should induce hen
to dispose of them, and that of course it as the diffie-
cult she had in advancing their right value, which had
oceasioned the length of time that had elapsed since
Ellen had first sought hcr.
 Would it not go far to prove she really did is to
return the money ?'' MIrs. Hamilton thought, long after
the widow had left her, and the sums she had advanced
returned with interest.  Was it to return the fatally
appropriated sum, or because she needed moral Ellen
lad so positively, and with such agony asserted the
first, that it was scarcely possible to disbelieve her; but

wat wans this useful diflieultr, this pressing demand
by one so young of so much money?' WHy, if it were
comparatively innocent, would she not speak?'' La
more she thought the more perplexed and anxious she
seemed to become. The aot itself of endeavouring to
dispose of the trinkets, especially those that had been
given and received, as loudly valuable because they had
been worn by her mother, would have bccn sufficiently
faulty to have occasioned natural displeasure, but com-
pared with other known and unknown faults, it sunk
into almost nothing. Mrs, Hamilton collected them all
together, those Mrs. Langford had returned, and the
few remaining in her niece's drawer, and carefully put
them away, till circumstances might authorise her re-
turning them to Ellen, and determined on saying nothing
more on the subject either to Ellen or her own family.
One thing Ellis reported to her regarding Allen,
which certainly seemed like a consciousness of the
wrong she had done rObert, and a wish to atone for it.
She begged Ellis so earuestly that she might see him, if
it were only for five minutes, that she could not resist
her, and when he came, she implored him so touching,
so pleadingly, to forgive her long silence himself, and
entrcat his mother to do so too; assuring him, that it
was the hope of being able to restore the notes to him,
without revealing he identity, which had caused
the silence, that it was scarcely possible to listen to
her unmoved. It was no false humility, but the deepest
most unieigned contrition for having been the cause of
injury.
Ten days after Ellon's imprisonment, the letter

alluded to as necessary to be received, before she could
write to her nephew, and the news it brought, though
somewhat allowed, would at another time have been
received with the greatest delight. Edward was re-
turning. In three weeks, or a month the utmost, after
the receipt of his conander's letter, he might be with

leave. here and been another and rather severe en-
gagement, in which young Fortescue had still more
distinguished himself; but from his headlong courage

Edward intended sending the pirate frigate which they
had taken, to England, as she was a tight-built, well-
looking craft enough, he wrote, if manned with honorable
men instead of desperate villains; and had nominated
Harding and Fortescue to accompany the second lieu-
tenant, as her officers.
The name of Harding produced no disagreeable remi-
science in Mrs. Hamilton's mind. It had been so
very long since Edward had even mentioned him, that
she had almost forgotten his early fancy for him. Hen
only thought now was thmanlfulness that her gallant
nephew had been preserved, and that he was coming
home. It could scarcely be pleasure she felt, though
all the young party did, for there was such an excite-
mint in Edward's courage, and in his having been in
two desperate engagements, and seen so much, that with
the buoyancy happily natural to well-disposed youth, they
would only think handle of his return, forgettingthe alloy
that mst cloud it. Mercy and herbert hoped he would

with him at least a week or ten days. If delayed, he
would very provoking just arrive, as they would be re-
turning to college.
After much painful deliberation, MIrs. HAmilton deter-
mined on making HErbert her messenger with these un-
expected tedious to llen; hoping more than she ex-
pressed that his gentle eloquence in bringing before her
the misery to which she must condemn her brother it
she would persist in this silence, and so compel an
appeal to him, would have some effect; especially as she
charged him to impress upon her, that even now confer-
sion should bring pardon, and concealment of all from
Edward. Herbert gladly undertook the mission, and sa
feelingly, so earnestly discharged it, that poor Ellen felt
more lent-broken than she had done yet, and almost
incapable of retaining her firmness. But she did; for
danger to eDward seemed more imminent now that he
was coming home, to the very vicinity of his dreaded
uncle, than when he was at n distance. She could only
feel thankful-if concealment were indeed so absolutely
necessary as he had declared it to be-that MIr. HAmilton
was still from home, and might continue to be so during
Edward's visit. It was difficult to repress the sickening
shudder, when Herbert chaucer to mention that HArding

could not satisfactorily explain why, either to himself
or his family, to pity for more than to blame. Percy
declared, as did Caroline and Miss Harcourt, that it
must be only his own too kind and gentle disposition,
which neer could blame anybody or anything. Irs.
Hamilton was bitterly disappointed; MIr. Howard in-
sister that such obduracy demanded nothing but the
sternest treatment, and he only wished MIr. Hamilton's
letter could arrive at once. He saw Ellen again himself
twice in the fire weeks, which elapsed between the disco-
very of her in and the arrival of Mr. Hamilton's answer;
but if kindness had so failed, it was comparatively easy
to resist his well-intentioned, but in this case utterly
mistaken sternness, He wasn general so kind, een in

It was as she and Mr. Howard nd both expected.
Ellen was no longer to remain at Norwood, but to be
placed under the care of a maiden lady, living in York-

occasionally visited Harwood, and was therefore well

it such dislike by the latter, as to make her actually

she ever had any feelings or not, MIrs. Hamilton, with
all her penetration, never could discover; but the good
she did was intense in practical benevolence, though
the quick sympathy, tlc kindly word, the indulgent
thought seemed utterly unknown. She had no pity for
faults or failings, always declaring forbearance and love
were all folly; `` if a branch were in the slightest degree
decayed, cut it of; if the blight extend to the root,
destroy it,'' she was fond of saying. As for youthful
follies or errors, she had no patience with them, for

sufficiently excusing, as to demand the avoidance of his
sentence altogether.
Miss Seldon's last visit to Lockwood was sufficiently
well remember by the young hamilton, (though it
was before their cousins ad arrived from India,) for
them all,-even Percy and Caroline, the most indignant
against Ellen,-to think of their father's sentence with
the deepest regret, and with almost dread for its effect
on Ellen.

Emmeline's exclamation. I did not feel quite sure

though I fear even confession would not help her much
now,''
Mars. Hamilton might and did think with them all,
but she could not swerve from her duty. She wrote at
once to MIss Seldon, not entering into particulars, but
merely asking if she would consent to take charge of a
long relative, whose conduct demanded more rigid
watchfulness and care, and an entire cessation of in-
indulgence, than could be the case in the family circle at
Norwood. She and her husband had such perfect con-
science in her, she said, that if she could oblige them
by undertaking the duty, they knew, without any
assurance on her part, that she would discharge it faith-
fully. The yearly sum they offered was large, because
they wished their young relative to have all the com-
forts and appurtenanctes of a gentleworan, and the
advantages of the best education, the city near which
she resided, could afford. Ms. HAmilton had no doubt
of the affirmative nature of the reply, for Miss Seldon
owed the recovery of her fortune and position entirely
to the exertions of Mr. Hamilton, and she had told him,
once for all, that if she could but were or oblige him in
any way, great or small, it would make her far happier
than she had cer been, or was likely to be in her solitary
life. The letter written and despatched, Mrs. Hamilton
summoned Ellen once more to her presence.
The scene was again the library, where she had been
writing, and the time nearing the short twilight of
October. It was three weeks, rather more, since Sir
eDward Manly's letter bad been received, and Edward

with which his unhappy sister looked to his return it
would be a rain attempt to define. At times the
intense longing to see him again, caused a wild almost
sick feeling of pleasure, that she might perhaps so soon
do so; then came all that had passed, and she picturcl
his anger, his loathing-true, it had been for him, but
he had not thought of such a deed. He would, he
must hate and spurn her, too, and the idea of meeting
him became absolute agony. Then-and she shoulder
in dread-would he think that he must acknowledge it
was for him she had thus acted? and, if so, had she not
betrayed instead of saying bim? Incident after incident
in their childhood rose before her, to give her hope that
he would be silent now, as then, and not betray him-
self; but these contending terrors, united with the con-
stant though silent suffering of her banishment from all
she loved, the utter hopelessness as to the end of this
trial, had not been without their effect on the outward
frame. Ellis did not see it, from so constantly watching
her, and from Ellen neer refusing to take the exercise
she desired her, and not making a single complaint as
to the pain it was sometimes to walk, and always to
swallow her meals ; but as she stood opposite to her
aunt, in the full light of the oriel indo-her ap-
roach had been so noiseless, MlIrs. Hamilton, who was
bending over some papers, did not see her, till she
chanced to look up-the attenuation of form and feature
was so very visible, that her aunt could not present herself

devise, to soothe or remove that anguish, whatever its
nature, far too deep and constant for one so very young
but how dared she do this, when by this determined
silence Ellen so defied her authority, and seemed so
resolved that neither severity nor kindness, nor her own
sufferings should humble hcr spirit, though they had
even affected her frame.
Conquering with a powerful effort the pleadings of
affection, MIrs. Hamilton calmly entered on the subject
for which she had summoned her, reading to her a
greater part of her uncle's letter, hoping that its severity
would spare her the pain of any additional remarks.
Every word seemed to burn itself on llen's brain.
What she had hoped sle knew not, for the thought she
had never hoped at all, but the words,  No cause can

by any chance discovered would she be forgiven,
and in time restored to confidence and love? And
now it was over, even that hope was gone
Mrs. Hamilton paused for a cpld or an observation,
but none came, and she continued impressively--:I
can scarcely hope, Ellen, that as can the idea of
sparing your only brother shame and misery, on

question I put to you, your residence with Migs Seldon

sensible and, apparently, most sinful conduct. If you
leave us still obdurate, years will, in all probability, pass
before we can feel sufficiently confident in the restored
integrity ad openness of your character as to permit

me it is useless to dwell upon. As the child of my only
and most dearly loved sister, I have loved you, hoped

sole exception of your bother, lI was the only being yo
had on earth united to you, by ties of blood. IIow this
conduct repays my love and care you must answer to
yourself; I can only be sensible of bitter disappoint-
ment.''
Again she stopped, evidently expecting a reply, but
Ellen still remained silent. The short twilight of autumn
had set in so suddenly, that MIrs. Hamilton was not
aware her niece's cheek had become still paler, and that
her white lips quivered repeatedly, as if she several
times tried to speak but could not. After a silence
of some minutes, she said-

If you are determined not to speak, Ellen, you may

till you leave us, though you will still occupy your pre-
sent rooms, and be still under eLlis's care, you are at
liberty to employ yourself, and go about the house and
grounds as usual.''
Ellen turned to go, still in the unbroken silence; she
had reached the low step dividing the upper from the
lower part of the room, and whether she did not see it,
or from some other cause, the room suddenly reeled
before her, and she fell heavily forwards. To spring
towards her, raise her tendely, hear her to the nearest
couch, though she so trembled herself at finding Ellen
quite insensible, as to render the task unusually diff-
cult, and to ring hastily for lois, was the work of a
minute, but it was many minutes before their united
efforts could bring back consciousness.

affection, which her illness had so often caused in her
childhood. Sense, or rather memory had not quite

And almost for the first time since hcr sin had been
discovered, she gave way to a long and violent fit of
weeping, which, though terrible while it lasted, as the
anguish of the young always is, greatly relieved hcr,

anxiety demanded it) to her uncle's sentence again.
MIrs. HAmilton sat for a very long time alone after
she had left Ellen. Ellis's words returned to her again

from them. Edward1 the cause of it all-could it be
possible?-could it he, that he had plunged himself
into difficulties, and, afraid to appeal to his uncle or her,
had so worked on Ellen as not only to make her send
relief, but actually so to keep his secret, as to endure
everything rather than betray it? Circumstance after
circumstance, thought after thought, so congregated
upon her, so seemed to hurst into being and flash light
out from the other, that her mind acted beneath their
pressure. Ellen's unhappiness the day his last letter
had been received, her sudden illness-had it taken place
before or after Robert had lost the money? She could
not satisfy herself, for her husband's sudden sumous
to Faroe, hasty preparations, and departure, had ren-
dered all that month confused and unsatisfactory in its
recollections. So intense was the relief of lie idea, that

devotion, so essentially women's characteristic, that she
resolutely checked its ascendency. All her previous
fancics, that Ellen was no ordinary child, that early
suffering and neglect had, while they produced some
childish faults, matured and deepened the capabilities
of endurance and control, from the consciousness (or

supposition) came the constantly favorable accounts of
Edward ; his captain's pride and confidence in him;
the seeming impossibility that he could get into such
difficulties, and what were they? The name of leading

made her tremble, by its probable explanation of the

CHAPTER YI.
TIME LIMIT GILIYIERS.
ThE earnest wishes and players of Mrs. HAmilton
and her faithful Ellis were disappointed. The latter
part of the month of September had been exceedingly
stormy, and though there was a lull from about the
3d to the 9th of October, the equinoctial gales then
set in with the utmost fury;, continuing day after day,
night after night, till the end seemed almost to time of
the sound, and the mind, anxious for friends at sca,
despair of their cessation. During the few calm days,
the young party at Norwood had scarcely been absent
from the windows, or for that part of the park leading to
the Plymouth road, above an hour a time. Percy and
Herbert rode over to Plymouth, but were told the frigate
could not be in for a full week. The late storms must
have detained her, though she was a fast-sailing craft.
It was a great disappointment to them, for on the 10th
of October college term began, and they were compelled
to return to Oxford. The cause of their mother's intense
desire for Edward's return, indeed, they did not know;
but they were most impatient to see him, and they
hoped, they did not exactly know what, with regard to
his influence with Ellen. IIowevcr, the day of their

departure care, and still he had not arrived, and the
storms had recommcnced. Percy had gone to say good-
bye to ellis, with whom Ellen chanced at that moment
to be. all of spirits and jokes, e indeterminate looked
away from his cousin, took both Ellis's hands, and shook
them with his usual heartless.
Good-bye, dear Ellis. I wonder if I shall ever feel
myself a man when talking to you. IIow many tricks
I have played you in this room, and you were always so
good-natured, even when one of my seat-crackers set
your best gown on fire and quite spoiled it, do you
remember it? I do think you were nearly angry then,
and quite enough to make you, and kapa made me case
up y money to buy you a new dress. I did not play
such a practical joke in a urry again,''
ELlis laughed and perfectly remembered it, and with
another hearty good-bye he turned away.
You have forgotten your cousin, MIr. Percy,'' sle
said, disregarding Ellen's imploring look.
 When she remembers her duty to my mother, I
will remember that she is my cousin,'' was his hasty
answer, and he hurried from the room as HErbert
entered. Isis good-bye to Ellis was quite as warm as
'percy's, and then turning to Ellen, he put his arm
around her, listed ler check, and said, with impressive
rCStnCSs-
Gol less you, dear Ellen? I hope you will be
happier when we meet again, and that it will not be so
long before we do, as we fancy now;'' and, affected
lost to tears at the grateful, double look she raised
to his, lc left her.
12
BIoME 1NI.ONCE.
Overcome as much by the harshness of the generous
warm-hearted Percy, whom she so dearly loved, as by
the gentle kindness of HErbert, Ellen remained for
several minutes with her arms on the table, her face hid
upon them. She thought she was quite alone, for
Ellis had gone about some of her business, when she
was startle by Percy's voice.
I m a brute, Ellen, nothing less; forgive me, and
say good-bye. I can't understand it at all, but any
as I am with to, your pale face haunts me like a
spectre, so we must part friends;'' and as she looked
hastily up, he ,kissed her warmly twice, and ran away
without another word.
Days passed heavily, the gales seeming to increase in
violence, and causing MIrs. Hamilton more terrible
anxiety and ague dread than she allowed to be visible.
The damage amongst the shipping was fearful, and the
very supposed vicinity of the frigate to the Channel
increased the danger. The papers every morning pre-
seated long lists of ships wrecked, or fatally dismantled,
loss of crews or part of them, mails and cargoes duc
but missing: and the vivid recollection of the supposed
fate of her own brother, the wretchedness of the
suspense, before the fate of his vessel was ascertained,
returned to heighten the fears that would gain asceu-
deny for her nephew; and for the effect of this terrible
suspense on Ellen, more especially,-if indeed she had
endured all these weeks, may, months of misery for
him.
At first Ellen seemed unconscious that there was
anything remarkable in the delay, the thought of her

113
own departure being uppermost ; but when the thought
did press upon her, how it came she knew not-that
of the given month the weeks were passing, and Edward
had not arrived, and that there must be some reason for
the long delay-storm, shipwreck, death, all clashed upon
her at once, and almost maddened er. The quiet calm
of endurance gave way. She could not sleep at night
from the tremendous winds; not even when Ellis had
a bel put p in her room, and remained with her all
night herself; she never complained indeed, but hour
after hour she would pace her room and the passage
leading to Ellis's, till compelled to cease from exhaustion,
she would try steadily to employ herself with some
difficult study, and succeed, perhaps, for half an hour,
but then remain powerless, or recommence her restless
walk. MIrs. IGnition made several attempts without
any apparent interference on her part, to get her to sit
occasionally with her and MIss Harcourt, and her
cousins, but she seemed to shrink from them all.
Emmeline indeed, when once aware of the terrible trial
she was enduring, would sit with her, drawing or work-
in as if nothing had occurred to estrange them, and
try to cheer her by talking on may topics of interest.
Caroline would speak to her kindly whenever she saw
her. MIss Harcourt alone retained her indignation,
for no suspicion of the real cause of her silence ever
entered cr mind.
Poor Ellen felt that she dared not indulge in the
comfort this change in her aunt's and cousins' manner
produced. he wanted to wean herself quite from
the, that the gang of separation might he less secure,

but she only seemed to succeed in loving them more.
One thought, indeed, at length took suel entire losses-
sion of her mind, as to deaden every other;-it was
the horrible idea that as she had signed to save Edward,
perhaps from merited disgrace, he would be taken from
her; she never breathed it, but it haunted her night
and day. MIr. MIaitland saw her continually, but hc
plainly told Mrs. HAmilton, while tlc case of anxiety
and mental suffering lasted he could do her no good.
It was a constant alternation of fearful excitement and
complete depression, exhausting the whole system.
Repose and kindness-alas the Latter might be given,
but the former, in the present position of affairs, how
could it be ensured?
The month of grace was winning; only two days
remained, and Edward had not arrived, and how could
MIrs. Hamilton obey her husband-whose every letter
reiterated his hope that she had not been prevailed on
to alter his sentence, if Ellen still remained silent--and
send her niece for her? Sle came at length to the
determination, that if another week passed and still
there were no ridings, not to let this fearful self-sacrifice,
if it really were such, last any longer, but gently,
cautiously, tenderly as she could, prevail on Ellen to
confide all to her, and promise of Edward really had
been erring and in difficulties, all should be forgiven
for her sake, and even his uncle's anger alerted. Once
her determination taken, she felt better enabled to
conduct an anxiety which was injuring hcr almost as
much as yEllen; and she turned to wIllis's roo, which
she had lately very often frequented, for she scarcely

felt comfortable when Ellen was out of her sight, tough'
she had fall confidence in Ellis's care.
Ellen was asleep on a sofa, looking so was, so
haggard-so altered from the Ellen of fie short months
back, that MIrs. Hamilton sat down by her side, ponder-
ing whether she was doing right to wait even another
week, before she should try to bring relief by vowing
her suspicions-but would it bring relief? and after all,
was it for Edward? or, ad she been allowing affection
and imagination to mislead and soften, when sternness
might still be needed ?
Ellen woke with a start as from some fearful dream,
and gazed at MIrs. Hamilton for a full minute, as if she
did not know her.
MIy dear Ellen, what is it? You have been sleeping
uncomfortably-surely you know me ?''
I thought I was at-at-Seldon Grange-are you
sure I am not? Dear Aunt Emmeline, do tell me I am
at Norwood, I know I am to go, and very soon; but
I am not there now, am I?'' and she put one hand to
her forehead, and gazed hurriedly and fearfully rond
her, while, with the other, she held tightly MIrs.
HAmilton's dress. There was something alarming both
in her look and tone.
No, love, you are with me still at Harwood, and
you will not go from me till have been with Edward
some little time. You cannot think I would send
you away now, Ellen ?''
The soothing tone, her brother's name, seemed
to disperse the cloud, and, bursting into tears, she
exclaimed-

 Your sin, Ellen, what can that have to do with

excitement, she continued--`` Nothing, nothing, indeed,

I do not think you quite know what you are saying,
my dear Ellen; your uncomfortable dream has unsettled
you. Try and keep quiet for an hour, and you will be
better. Remember, suffering as this dreadful suspense
is, your brother is still in a Father's gracious keeping:
and that IIe will listen to your prayers for his safety,
and if it be IIis good pleasure, still restore him to you.''

while I would not confess; I hd refused His mercy.''
Can you confess before God, Ellen? Can you lay
your whole heart open before IIi, and ask IIi in his
infinite mercy, and for your Saviour's sake, to forgive
you?''
I could, and did a so,'' answered Ellen, returning
MIrs. Hamilton's enruestly inquiring look, by raising her
large expressive eyes, steadily and ferlessly, to her face;

betrayed the misery of the fear.

confide the source of your grief and difficulty to me,
Ellen? Will yo not do so-even if I promise forge-

Ellen, in a fearful tone of returning excitement, and,
sitting upright, sle clasped her lands conclusively to-
gentler, while her cheek burned with painful brillianey.

`And you may not tell me whom you hae promise?''
replied Mrs. HAmilton, very former thought rendered
apparently null and in by these words, and painfully
disappointing her; but the answer terrified her.
MIamma-I promised er, and she stands by me so
pale, so grieve, whenever I think of telling you,''
answered Ellen, clinging to Mrs. Hamilton, but looking
with a strained gaze of terror on vacancy.I thought

face in her aunt's dress.
Mrs. Hamilton was dreadfully alarmed. What-
ever the foundation, and she had no doubt that
there was some, and that it really had to do with
Edward and his poor mother's mistaken partiality,
Ellen's imagination was evidently disordered. To attempt
obtaining the truth, while she was in this fearful state
of excitement, was as impossible as cruel, and she tried
only to soothe er to composure; speaking of her
mother, as happy and in INvent, and that Ellen had
thought of her so much, as was quite natural in her
sorrow, that she fancicd she saw her,

would still see me, and know if I kept my promise, and

Ellen made no answer; but the alarming excitement
lad so far subsided, as to raise the hope that quietness
would subdue it altogether. MIrs. HAmilton remained
with her, till she seemed quite calm, and would not
have left her then, but she had promised Caroline to
drive with her into IT- that afternoon to make some
purchases ; Emmeline and Miss Harcourt were spending
the day at Greville MInor, and her daughter depending
on her, she did not like to disappoint her. But the
difficulty to think of other things, and cheerfully con-
else on comparatively indifferent topics, was greater
than she had ever found it. That Ellis' s sunrise was
correct, she had no longer the smallest doubt. Ellen
was sacrificing herself, not merely for the love she bore
er brother, but from some real or imaginary promise
to her poor mother. What its exact nature was, she
could not indeed satisfy herself, but that it had some-
thing to do with concealing Edward's faults seemed to
ash upon her, she hardly knew how. Ellis's words

`that she had seen enough of that work when they
were children,'' returned to her, and various incongrui-
ties in Ellen's character and conduct, which she had
been unable to reconcile at the time, all seemed con-
acted with it. But to arrive at the truth was much
more difficult than cer; still how could she send Ellen
away  and yet, if still silent, would mere surmise satisfy
her husband? here was but one hope, one ray flight-
Edward's own honour, if indeed he were permitted to
return; and even while driving and talking with
Caroline, her heart was one fervent prayer that this
might be, and the fearful struggle of her devoted Ellen
cease.
TIer hunt's gentle and unexpected kindness hand had
such a beneficial effect on Ellen, that, after her early
dinner, about three o'clock, she told Ellis she would go
in the schoolroom, and try and read there for an hour;
she knew all the family were out, and therefore would
be quite undisturbed. Ellis willingly acquiesced, re-
joining that she should seek any change herself, and
advised her, as it was such a mild soft afternoon after
the late storms, to take a turn on the terrace, on which
a glass-look from the scloolroom opened; it would do
her good. Ellen ment to take her advice, but as she
looked out from the window or a well-remembered
landscape, so many painful thoughts and recollections
crowded on her, that she lost all inclination to move.
She cannot stood there for many weeks, and it seemed
to her that the view had never looked so very lovely,

humid emerald which always follows heavy rain, and
though the sumer-flowers and all gone, the sheltered
beds of the garden, lying beneath the terrace, presented
many very beautiful still. The end of the terrace, a flight
of stone steps, overlooked the avenue, leading from the
principal lodge to the main entrance, and where Ellen
stood, she could distinguish a few yards of the path
where it issued from some distant trees. She gazed
at first, conscious only that she was banished from it
all, and that, however long her departure might be
deferred, she must go at last, for her uncle's mandate
could not be disobheyed ; but gradually her eye became
fixed as in fascination. A single figure was emerging
from the trees, and dressed in theuniform of a midship-
man-she was sure it was butt was a figure so tall, sa
slim, his step so lingering-it could not be Edward,
most likely somc one of his estimates, come to tell his
fate. He was taller even than Percy, but so much
lighter, so different to the boy from whom she had
parted, that, though her heart hounded and sunk till
faintness seemed to overpower her, she could not con-
vinci herself it was he. With an almost unconscious
effort she ran out, through the glass-door, to the steps of
the terrace; she could see him now distinctly, but not
his face, for is cap was low over his forehead; but as
he approached, he paused, as if doubting whether to go
up to the all-door, or the cell-down terrace, by which
he had always rushed into the schoolroom, on his daily
return from Mr. IIowuard's; and as he looked hastily up,
his cap fell back, and his eyes mct Ellen's. A will but
checked scream broke from her lips, and all was an

impenetrable mist till she found herself in her brother's
arms, in the room she had quieted, his lips repeatedly
pressing her cheek and forehead, and his voice, which
sounded so strange-it did not seem like Edward's, it
was so much more deep and manly-generating her to
speak to him, and tell him why she looked so ill; but
still her heart so throbbel she could not speak. She
could only cling close to him and look intently in his
face, which was so altered from the happy, laughing
boy, that had he not been, from his extreme palenecss
and attenuation of feature, still more like their mother
when she was ill, his sister would scarcely have
known him.

Ellen, shrinking in terror from the expression of her

years, knelt down to my God for pardon, mercy to

Ms. IIALroN had been told at the lodge of her
nephew's arrival, and so powerful was her emotion, that
she leant back in the carriage, as it drove rapidly from
the lodge to the Hall, without the power of uttering a
word. Caroline was surprised, for his return seemed to
her only a cause of rejoicing;-she had no idea of the
mingled dread and joy, the trembling, lest Edward had
indeed deceived them all, and, if he had not, the
redoubled mystery of Ellen's conduct. While he was
absent she could think calmly on him as the cause of all,
but now that he was returned, her heart seemed to turn
sick with apprehension, and she had hardly strength to
inquire where he was, and great was her surprise when she
found his arrival was still unknown. Caroline's joyful

away some of her purchases, drew her there at once,
and for the first five minutes the intense thanlfulness
that he was indeed safe and comparatively well,-that
whatever might be the secret change, his affection for
her, to judge by the warmth nd agitation of his
embrace, was unchanged, and she had that to work on,

alone occupied her mind and enabled her to regain her
calmness.
Yon lo, indeed, look as if you wanted English air
and home nursing, my dear boy,'' she said, after some
little time had elapsed, and Edward had seated himself
by her, his hand still clasped in hers;  Sr Edward was
quite right to invalid you. kEmmeline does nothing but
talk of our wounds as making you a complete hero; I
am romantic enough to wish that you had brought me
home more colour and more flesh, and less glory; but, I
suppose from being so palm, you are more like your poor
mother tan her;'' and she looked at him so earnestly,
that Edward's eyes, spite of all his efforts, sunk beneath
hers. He answered gaily, however, and, in reply to
Caroline's numerous queries, entered into an animated
description of their voyage home and the causes of their
detention, in their being so often compelled to put into
port from the fearful storms they ad encountered, and
time slipped away so fast that the dinner-bell rung
before any one was prepared.
That Ellen should look paler than even when she had
left her in the morning, and be still more silent, did not
astonish Mrs. Hamilton; the agitation of meeting her
brother was quite enough to occasion it; and she
advised her to remain quiet while they were at dinner,
that she might rejoin them afterwards. She looked
as if she land been so very lately ill, that Edward was
not surprised at hor having dined already; but many

him. Sle seemed restrained and shy, too, with him, as
if in constant terror. pOor child her aunt had advised
quietness while alone, and her mother's words rung i
her cars, till rcpose seemed farther off than eer. After
all she had suffered before, and after the sending that
fatal letter, it had never reached him: she had utterly
failed in her attempt to save him. If she had, indeed,
confided at first in MIrs. HAmilton, measures would have
been taken, she was sure, to have secured him the
necessary relief, for whenever her uncle had sent him
his allowance it was through Sir Edward, not enough-
turing the risk of the loss of a letter. There had been
times when, in the midst of her sufferings, Ellen could
realize a sort of comfort in the idea that she had saved
Edward and kept his secret; but there was this com-
for now7 All she had endured, all she was still to
endure, was for nothing, worse than nothing; for if
award knew her in, feeling that it had brought
him no good, and given up, as she felt he must be,
to unrestrained passion, or he could not have given
vent to such fearful sentiments, she actually trembled
for its effect upon him and his anger on herself.
She had sometimes fancied that, perhaps, his errors
were not so great as he believed them, that he
would confess them when he found only his kind
indulgent aunt at home, and so peace and hope
gradually dawn for both him and her. All hor wish,

its cause or not, its effect on it would be so terrible,
that she felt any additional suffering to herself could
be better borne.
With these thoughts, no wonder she was silent, utterly
unable to subdue them as she wished, and evince natural
interest in all that had occurred to Edward; and tell him
all that had happened to herself during their long sepa-
ration. Carolina, however, was so animated; and when
Emmeline and Miss Harcourt returned, unable to com-
pretend what they could possibly be sent for, a full
hour earlier than usual, their astonishment and delight
at seeing Edward, prevented anything like a pause in
conversation, or unnatural restraint. His cousins found
so much to tell as well as to listen to, about Percy and
HErbert, as well as themselves; and Emmeline made
Edward tell her such minute particulars of their engage-
ments with the pirates, and how he was wounded, and
what Sir Edward said to him, that MIrs. Hamilton,
anxious as she was-for the longer she was with her
nephew, the more convinced she was that he could not
meet her eye, and that is gaiety was not natural-she
could not help being amused in spite of herself.
Engrossed with thought how to arrive at the truth,
for which she so ardently longed, she entered the
library, when the prayer-bell rung, with her children ;
quite forgetting, till she had taken the place at the
reading-desk, which, in the absence of her husband
and sous, she always occupied herself, that she had
intended to desire Ellen to resume her usual place by
Emmeline, wishing to spare her any additional suffering

it exceed her exceedingly. She looked hastily round, in
the hope of being in time, hut Ellen was already in her
place, though sle hal evidently shrunk still more into
the recess of the lower window, as if longing for its
massie curtains to hide her, and her face was buried in
her hands. MIrs. IInmilton would have been still more
grieved if she had scan, as Ellis did, the beseeching
humble look, which as they entered Ellen had fixed
upon her, and that her pale lips had quivered with the
half-uttered supplication, which she failed in courage
fully to pronounce. Edward appeared too wrap in his
own thoughts to notice it then; and as his aunt's
gentle but impressive voice fell on his ear, the words,
the room, the whole scene so recalled the happy, and
comparatively innocent past, that it was with difficulty he
could restrain his feelings, till the attitude of kneeling
permitted them full ent in tears, actual tears, when he
had thought he could never weep again. The contest
of his past and present self, rendered the one more
brightly happy, the other more intensely dark than the
actual reality. The unchecked faults nd passions of
his early childhood had been the sole cause of his pre-
sent errors; but while under the gentle control of his
aunt and uncle and MIr. FOrward, he had not known these
faults, and, therefore, believed they had all come since.
IIe longed intensely to confide all his errors, all his
remorse, to MIr, FOrward, whom he still so dearly loved;
but he knew he had not courage to confess, and yet
hated himself for his cowardice.

even more than usually penetrating from anxiety), as
he arose, and became aware, for the first time, that
Ellen was not where he was accustomed to see her. He
kissed her only as se hurricdly approached im, but
perceiving she left the room with merely a faint good
night to the rest of the family, and no embrace, as
usual, from MIrs. IGnition, he darted forwards, seized
his aunt's hand, and exclaimed-

 Not to-night, my denr Edward. It is a long tale
and a painful one, and I rely on you to help me, that
Ellen and myself may be again as we have been. It is
as much pain to me as to her that we are not. To.

had excitement enough for to-day, and after your ex-
haunting voyage must need rest. Do not fancy this an
evasion of your request; I have longed for your return
to influence Ellen, almost as much as for the happiness
of seeing you again.''
Edward was compelled to be satisfied and retire; but
though he did feel sufficient physical exhaustion, for the
comfort of his room to be unusually luxurious, his sleep
was restless and disturbed by frightful dreams, in which,
however tried the position, it always seemed that he
was in danger, and Allen sacrificing herself to save
him.

On retiring for the night, Mrs. HAmilton discovered
a one on her dressing-table. She thought she knew
the writing, but from tremulousness it was so nearly
illegible, that it was with great difficulty she enciphered
the following words:
I am so conscious I ought not to address you,
know so well that I have no right to ask any favour from
you, when I have given you so much trouble and pain,
that I could not have asked it, if you had not been a
very, very kind this morning. Ohl Aunt Emmeline,

from Norwood; tell him I have been very nickel-
have refused to since any real repentance-but do not
tell him what I have done. He is ill, unhappy at
having to resign his profession even for a few months.
Oh l spare him the misery of knowing my sin. I know
I deserve nothing but severity from you-I lae no
right to ask this-but, ohl if you have ever loved
me, do not refuse it. If you would but grant it, would

Mrs. Hamilton's eyes filled with tears; the word
`you'' had evidently been written originally, but par-
tally erased, and  the'' substituted in its stead, and she
could not read the utter desolation of one so young,
which that simple incident betrayed, without increase
of pain; yet to grant her request was impossible. It
puzzled her-for why should she so persist in the wish

expressed from the bcgining that Edward should not
know it:' unless, indeed,-and her heart bounded with the
hope-that she feared it would urge him to confess lim-
self the cause, and her sacrifice be useless. She locked up
the note, which she would not read again, fearing its deep
 humility, its nearest supplication, wold turn her from
her purpose, and in praying fervently for guidance and
ftful sleep ler night passed.
For some time after breakfast the following morning,
Elward and his aunt were alone together in the library.
It was with the utmost difficulty, he suppressed, suffix-
central to conceal, the fearful agitation which thrilled
through every nerve as he listened to the tale e ad
demanded. He could not doubt the use to which that
money has been applied. His sister's silence alone
would have confirmed it; but in that hour of madness,
--for what else is passion unrestrained by principle or
feeling -he was on conscious of anger, fierce anger
against the unhappy girl who had borne so much for
him. IIe had utterly forgotten the desperate words he
had written. IIe ad neer received the intended relief.
ITiIl within a week, a short week of his return, he had
been in Harding's power, and as Ellen's adoption had
saved his nothing, what could t weigh against the
maddening conviction, that if he had one spark of
honour remaining, he st confess that he had caused
her sin? instead of saving, she had betrayed him; and
he left his aunt to seek Ellen, so evidently disturbed and
heated, and the interview itself had been so little satis-
factory in softening him, as, she had hoped, to win
him to confession at one, for the lad purposely spoken

as indulgent of error and difficulty as she could, with-
out betraying her strengthened suspicions, that if she
had known how to do so, she would have forbidden his
seeing Ellen till he was more calm.
Unhappily, too, it was that part of the day when Ellis
was always most engaged, and she was not even in her
own room, so that there was no check on eDward's
violence. The control he lad exercised while with his
aunt but increased passion when it was removed. IIe
poured forth the bitterest rcproachcs-asked how she
could dare hope relief so obtained, would ever he been
allowed to reach him?-what had she done but betrayed
him? for how could be be such an dishonoured coward
as to let her leave Norwood because she would not
speak' and why had she not spoken-why not be-
synced him at once, and not decoded him home to
disgrace and misery? Passion had so maddened him,
that he neither knew what he said himself, nor heard
her imploring entreaties not to betray himself, and she
her would. She chung to his kuces ns she knelt be-
for him, for she was too powerless to stand, reiterating
her supplication in a tone that ought to have recalled

arrived at one particular spot he knew not, for it was
one which of all others, in that moment of excite-
mint, he would gladly hae avoided. It was a
small glide in the midst of the wood shelving down
to the water's edge, where he and Perey, with the
assistance of Robert, had ecn permitted to erect. a
miniature boat-house, and where Edward had kept a
complete flotilla of tiny vessels. There were the trees,
the glad, the hot-house still, a, and the vessels, in such
beautiful repair and keeping, that it brought back the
past so vividly, so overpowering, from the voiceless
proof, which it was, of the affectionate remembrance with
which he and his favorite tastes had been regarded,
even in his absence, that he could not bear it. Ie flung
himself full length on the greensward, and as thought
after thought came back upon him, bringing Ellen
before him, self-sacrificing, devoted, always interesting
between him and anger, as she had done from the first
hour they had been inmates of Lynwood, the thought
of that crane blow, those mad reproaches was in-
supportable; and he sobbed for nearly an hour in that
one spot, longing that some chance would but bring
MIr. FOrward to lm, that he might relieve that fearful
remorse at once, but utterly unable to seek him of
himself.
Elward's disposition, like his mother's, was naturall
much too good for the determined pursuit of evil. IIis
errors had actually been much less grave, than from
Harding' s artful representations he imagined them. IIe

closely banished the religion which his aunt had so
tried to instil, and been taught by AWarding to scoff at
the only safe guide for youth, as for every age, Gol's
holy word, he had nothing heroin to lean, either as a
comfort in his remorse, a hope for amendment, or
strength for self-conquest; and terrible indeed might
have been the consequences of HArding's fatal influence,
of the influence of a home of love had not been still
stronger.
Two hours after he had quieted his aunt, he rejoined
the family, tranquil, but bearing such evident traces of
a mental struggle, at least so Mrs. Hamilton fancied,
for no one else notice it, that she still hoped she did
not exactly know what, for she failed in courage to ask
the issue of his interview with Ellen. She contented
herself with desiring Emmeline to tell her cousin to
bring her work or drawing, and join them, and she was
so surprised, when Emmeline brought back word that
Ellen had said she had much rather not, that she sought
her herself.
Ellen's cheeks, in general so pale, were crimson, her
eyes in consequence naturally brilliant, and she looked
altogether so unlike herself, that her aunt was more
anxious than ever; nor did her manner when asked why
she refused to join them, when Edward hd so lately
returned, tend to decrease the feeling.
 Emmeline did not say you desired it, or I should
have known better than to disobey,'' was her reply, and
it was scarcely disrespectful; the tone seemed that of
spirit, crushel and godel to the utmost, and so utterly
nable to contend more, though very here was quiver-

ing with pain. MIrs. HAmilton felt bitter pain that
Ellen at length did indeed shrink from her; that the
disregard of her entreaty concerning her brother
appeared so to have wounded, that it had shaken the
affection which no other suffering had had power to
moc.
I o not desire it, Ellen, though I wish it,'' she
replied, mildly; ` you are of course at liberty to act as
you please, though I should have thought it most
natural that, not having been with Edward so long,
you should wish to be with him as much as possible
of he is at home.''
 IIe will not wish it; he hates me, spurns me, as I
knew he would, if he knew my sins To-day I was to
have gone to eldon Grange; let me go at once then
neither he, nor you, nor any one need be tormented
with me any more, and you will all be happy again; let

If you wish it, Ellen, ou shall go next week. I
did not imagine that under any circumstances, you
could have expressed a desire to leave me, or suppose
that it would make me particularly happy to send you
away.''
 Why should it not you must hate me, too, or-or
you would not have refused the only-only favour I
asked you before I went,'' answered poor Ellen, and the
voice, which had been unnaturally clear, was choked
for the moment with sobs, which she resolutely forced
back. Mrs. Hamilton could scarcely hear it; taking
her ice-cold hands in both her, she said, almost
tenderly-
168
BIoME INFLUENCE.
You have reason to condemn me as harsh and cruel,
Ellen ; but time will perhaps explain the motives of my
conduct, as I trust and pray it will solve the mystery
of yours; you are not well enough to be left long alone,
and Ellis is so much engaged to-day that I do with you
to be with me independent of your brother's society.
If you so much prefer remaining here, I will stay with
you, though of course, as Elward has been away from
us so long, I should wish to be with him also.''
It was almost the first time MIrs. IIumilton had ever
had recourse in the management of her family to any-
thing that was not perfectly straightforward; and
though her present motives would have hallowed much
deeper stratagems, her pure mind shrunk from her own
words. She wished Ellen to be constantly in Edward's
presence, that he might not be able to evade the impulse
of feeling and honour, which the sight of such suffering,
she thought must call forth; she could not bear to
enforce this wish as a command, when she had already
been, as she felt-if Ellen's silence were indeed self-devo-
tion, not guilt-so cruelly and so necessarily severe.
Ellen made neither reply nor resistance, but, taking up
her work, accompanied er and to the usual morning-
room, from which many a burst of happy laughter, and
joyous tones were echoing. Caroline and Emmcline
were so full of enjoyment at Edward's return, had so
many things to ask and tell, were so perfectly unsuspi-
cios as to his having any concern with his sister's full,
that if they did once or twice think him less lively and

suspicious, secretly accused eLlen as the cause of his
occasional abstraction: her conduct was not likely to

had been harsh with her, as from Allen's fenrfully
drinking manner, and complete silence when they were
together, she fancied, she thought it was so deserved,
that she had no pity for her whatever.
The day passed briskly and happily enough, in seeming
to MIrs. hamilton aud Edward, in reality to all the other
mcbers of the party-but one. The great subject of
regret was MIr. IIownrd's absence, he might be back at
the Rectory that evening, and Receive was sure he
would come to see Edward directly. As the hours
waned, Ellen became sensible of a sharp and most un-
usual pain darting through hcr temples, and gradually
extending over her forehead and head, till she could
scarcely move her eyes. It had come at first so suddenly,
and lasting so short a time, that she could scarcely
define what it was, or why she should have felt so
suddenly sick and faint; but it increased, till there was
no difficulty in tracing it, and before prayer-time, had
become such fearful agony, that, if she had not been
inured to pair of all kinds, and endowed with extra-
ordinary fortitude and control, she must more than once
have betrayed it, by either giving way to faintness, or
screaming aloud. She had overheard Irs. Hamilton
desire AIrport, to request Mr, ailand to come to Oak-
wood as soon as he could, and not hearing the reply
that he was not expected home till late night, cs-

pectel him every moment, and thought he would give
her something to relieve it, without her complaining.
REward had asked his cousins for some music, and
then, to please Emmeline, and sketched the order of
their engagement with the pirates, and no one noticed
her, for Mars. hamilton's heart was sinking with his-
appointed hope, as the hours passed, and there was no
sign to prove that her surmise was correct, and if it
were, that the truth would be obtained.
The prayer-bill rug, and as they rose, Edward's eyes,
for the first time since she had joined them, sought and
fixed themselves on his sister's face. Te paroxysm of
pain had for a few minutes subsided, as it had done
alternately with violence all day, but it ad loft her sa
ghastly pale, that he started in actual terror. It might
have been fancy, but i thought there was the trace of
his cowardly blow on her ple forehead, raised, and
black, and such a feeling of agony anl remorse rushed
over him, that it was with difficulty he restrained him-
self from catching her in his arms, and besceehing her
forgiveness before them all; but there was no time
then, and they proceeded to the library. Every step
Ellen took appeared to bring back that fearful pnin,
till as she sat down, and then knelt in her place, she
was sensible of nothing else.
The service was over; and as MIrs. Hamilton rose
from the private prayer, with which each individual
concluded his devotions, her nephew stool before her,

Several of the. lower domestic had quieted the library
before Edward regained ice, and his first word, or
rather action, was to desire those that remained to stay.

For a full minute after these unexpected, startling
words there was silence, for none could speak, not even
Emmeline, whose first thought was only joy, that
Ellen's silence was not so guilty as it seemed. Edward
had crossed his arms on the reading-desk, and buried
his face upon them. The instantaneous change of sent-

those most prejudiced can scarcely be described ; but

Ellen unleashed her hands from her forehead, and
looked up in MIrs. Hamilton's face. Her lips moved as
if to speak, but in a moment an expression of agony
fitted over her face, a cry broke from her of such
fearful physical pain, that it thrilled through the hearts
of all who heard, and consciousness deserted her at the
same moment, that Mr. MAinland and MIr. Forward,

ILLNESS3 AND REMORSE.
173
It was indeed a fearful night will followed the close
of our last chapter. Illness, sufficient to occasion
anxiety, both in Herbert and Ellen, had been often an
inmate of Lakewood, but it had merely called for care,
and all those kindly sympathies, which render disposing-
tion sometimes an actual blessing, both to those who
suffer and those who tend. But illness, appearing to
be but the ghastly vehicle of death, clothed in such fear-
ful pain, that no control, een of reason and strong will,
can check its agonized expression, till at last, reason
itself succbs beneath it, and bears the mind from the
tortured frame, this is a trial of no ordinary suffering,
een hen such illness has been brought about a what
may be termed natural causes. But when it follows, nay,
springs from rental anguish, when the sad watchers
feel that it might lapse been alerted, that it is the con-
sequence of mistaken treatment, and it comes to the

known, was it marvel that Mrs. Hamilton, as she
stood by Ellen's bed, watching the alternations of death-
like sensibility, with paroxysm of pain, which nothing

freer), felt as if she had indeed neer known grief or
anxiety before. She had looked forward to Edward's con-
session bringing hope and rest to all; that the aching
hand and strained nerves of her poor Ellen, only needed
returning love, and the quickness of assured forgiveness
for herself and Edward, for health and happiness grade-
ally to return; and the shock of such sudden and terrible
illness, betraying, as it did, an extent of previous mental
suffering, which she had not conceived as possible in
one so young, almost unnerved her. But hers was not
a character to give way; the anguish she experienced
might be read in the almost stern quiet of her face, in
her gentle but firm resistance to every persuasion to
move from Ellen's bed, not only through that dreadful
right, but for the week which followed. The idea of
death was absolute agony; none bunt her God knew the
struggle, day after days, night after night, which slc
endured, to compel her rebellious spirit to submission to
IIis ill, whatever it might be. She knew earth's
dearest, most unalloyed happiness could not compare

caused all the suffering she beheld. She is not utter

times when heart and frame felt so utterly exhausted, it
seemed as if she rust.
MIr. HOward's presence al been an inexpressible re-

Not understanding her, except that Elward must be

poured out his whole tale. It is needless to enter upon
it here in detail; suffice it, that the artful influence of
DIviding, by gradually undermining the good prices-
signs of the home he had left, had prepared his pupil for an
unlimited indulgence in pleasure, and excitement,at every
opportunity which offered. And as the pRince William
was cruising off the coast of British American, and con-
distant touching at one or other of her ports, where
Harding, from lis seniority and usefulness, and eDward,
from his invariahle good conduct, were often permitted
to go ashore, those opportunities, especially when they
were looked for and used by one practised in deceit and
wickedness, icrc often found. It does not require a long
period to initiate in gambling. The very compelled re-
strain, in the intervals of its indulgence, but increased its
maddening cxcitcmcnt, and once given up to its blind
pursuit, Building became more than ever necessary to
Edward, and of course is power over him increased.
But when i tried to make him a share and conniver
in his own low pleasures, to teach him vice, cautiously
as he thought had worked, he failed; Edward started
back appalled, and though unhappily he could not break
from it, from that hour he misdoubtcd and shrank
away. But he had given an advantage to his fell tutor,
the extent of which he knew not himself. HArding was

too well versed in art to betray disappointment. IIe
knew when to bring wine to the billiard-table, so to create
such a delirium of excitement, that Edward was wholly
unconscious of his own actions; and once or twice, he
led him into scenes, and made him sharcr of such
vicious pleasures, that secured him as his slave; for when
the excitement was over, the agony of remorse, the
misery, lest his confiding captain should suspect him
other than e seemed, made him cling to FInding's
promises of secrecy, as his only refuge, ven while he
loathed the man himself. It was easy to make such a
disposition believe that he had, in some moment of ex-
excitement, done something which, is known, wouldecpel
in the Ny; Edward could never recall what, but he
beliesrel him, and became desperate. Harding told him
it was downright folly to think about it so seriously. It
was only known to in, and he would not betray him.
But Edward writhed beneath his power; perpetually he
called on him for pecuniary help, and when he had
none, told him he must write home for it, or win it at
the billiard-table, or he knew the consequences; and
Elward, though again and again he had resolved he
would not touch a ball or cut, (and the remorse had
been such, that he would no doubt have kept the
couple, had it not been for dread of betrayal,) rather
than write home, would madly seek the first opportunity,
and play, and win perhaps enough, all but few pounds,
to satisfy his tormentor, and for these he would appeal
to his sister, and receive them as we know; never ask
ing, nd so never hearing, the heavy price of individual
suffering at which they were obtained.

The seven or eight months which had elapsed before
his last fatal appeal, had been occasioned by the ship
being out at sea. Sir Edward had mentioned to Mr.
IIanilton, that Edward's excellent conduct on board
had given him n longer holiday on share, when they
were off New York, to which place he had been de-
snatched on business to the President, than most of his
companions. Edward thought himself safe, fon
Harding had been unusually quiet, but the very day
they neared land, he told him he must have some cash,
sneered at the trifling sum Edward lad by him, toll him
if he close to let him try for it fairly, they should have
a chance at billiards for it; but if that failed, he must
pump his rich relations for it, for have it he must.
Testing to his luck, for he had often won, even with
Harding, he rushed to the table, played, and as might
be expected, left off, owing his tormentor fifty pounds.
Harding's fiendish triumph, and his declaration that he
must trouble him for a cheque to that amount, signed
by the great millionaire, Arthur Hnruilton, Esq., goaded
him to madness. He drank down a large draught of
branly, and deliberately sought another table and
another opponent, nd won back fifteen: but it was
the last day of his stay on shore, as his slayer knew,
and it was the wretchcdness, the misery of this heavy

freshness and innocence, who had solemnly sworn if he
did not pay it by the next letters from his home, he
would inform against him, and he knew the cone-

so. I know you will tell me, pray-trust. If I had

There was much in the end tale he had hcnard to give
hope, and Mr. FOrward longed to impart its comfort to
MIrs. Hamilton; but he felt she could not listen. While
day after day passed, and the poor sufferer for another's
error lay hovering between life and death, reason s
utterly suspended, that even when the violent agony of
the first seven days and nights had subsided into
lethargic stupors, alternating with such quiet submission
and gentle words, that, had it not been for their wander-
ing sense, one might have fancied intellect returning:
still reason was absent-and, though none said it aloud,
the fear would gain dominion that health might return
but not the mind. The first advice had been procured;-
what was distance, even then, to wealth-every reed
resorted to. Her luxuriant hair cut close, and ice itself
applied to cool that burning tlrobbing pain; but all

days, somewhat renewed Mr, MIaitland's hope.

children trembled for her; conjuring her, for their
sakes, for her husband's, to take repose. MIr. Finland's

And she did denote herself to Edward, and so success-
full-with er gentle sympathy with his grief, her
tender feeling towards his faults, her conviction of her
father's forgiveness, her unassumig but heart-breathing
pity, which without one word unduly introduced of a

took both her hands in his, and with even unusual

sufferings, she did not think for a moment, that he could
imagine her never referring to his confession, originated
in displeasure.
Ton or twelve days had so passed, when one after-
noon, completely exhausted its two nights' watchful-
ness-for though Nurse LAngford and Fanny were in
constant attendance on Ellen, she could not rest if she
heard that harrowing cry for her, even thongl her pre-
since brought no comfort,-she wct to lie down
for a few hours on a couch in her dressing-room.
Caroline had taken a book, though with not much in-
lination to read, to sit by her, and watch that her
sleep should not be disturbed. How, in those moments
of quiet did she long for her father feeling intuitively
how much heavier was her mother's trial without his
lord support. He had been written to by them all
since Edward's confession. MIrs. hamilton had done
so in Ellen's room, only to beseech him to write for-
giving, forbearingly, to the unhappy cause of all. She
did not dare breathe her feelings, even on paper, to him,
convinced that if she did so, control must give way, and
she was powerless at once; but her husband knew her
so well, that every suppression of individual emotion
betrayed more forcibly than the most earnest words, all
she was enduring.
Caroline lad kept her affectionate vigil nearly two
hours, when Edward's once whispered,  MIss IIarceourt

possible. She left him, and Edward, drawing a low
stool to the foot of the couch, as if not daring to occupy
his cousin's scat, which was close by the pillow, gazed
on the mild gentle features of his aunt, as in their deep
repose they showed still clearer the traces of anxiety and
sorrow, and felt more likely than ever the full amount
of misery, which his errors and their fatal concealment
had created.  Why is it,'' he thought, ` that man
cannot bear the punishment of his faults without causing
the innocent, the good, to suffer also?'' And is heart
seemed to answer, ` Because by those very social ties, the
strong impulses of love for one another, which would
save others from woe, we may be preserved and
redeemed from vice again and yet again, when, were
man alone the sufferer, vice would he stronger than
remorse, and never be redeemed,''
Mrs. HAmilton woke with that painful start which long
watchfulness always occasions, and missing Caroline,
yet feeling as if she were not alone, her eyes speedily
told themselves in some surprise on the figure of her
nephew, who, unable to bear the thoughts the sight of
her exhaustion produced, and sent his head upon the
couch. Inexpressibly touched, and glad of the opfor-
unity to speak to him alone, she called him to her, and
there was something in the one that encouraged him to
cling himself on his knees by her side, and so like an
infant, saying, almost inarticulately-

Ellen's perfect justification, to examine her letters and
papers, but that all his appeals to her had been destroyed
but one-his last fatal enclosure, the exact contents of
which he had so utterly forgotten, written, as they were
in a moment of madness, that he saddened himself as
he read it. He placed the paper in MIrs. Hamilton's
hand, conjuring her not to recall her forgiveness when
she rand it; but she must see it, it was the only amends
he could make his poor llen, to exculpate her fully.

devoted silence afterwards, drilling incidents which she
had forgotten returned to adl their weight of evidence,

Edward, the illness which followed, and could well
understand her dread lest the finding the notes should
be traced to that day, and so throw a suspicion on her
brother, and her consequent firmness in refusing to state
the day she had found them.
That long interview was one of inexpressible comfort
to Edward; but though his unfeigned repentance and
full confession gave his aunt hope for him, it did but
increase her individual trial, as she returned to Ellen's
couch and listened to wanderings only too painfully ex-
planned by the tale she had heard.

It was the seventeenth day of Ellen's illness, and for
six and thirty hours she had slept profoundly, waking
only at very long intervals, just sufficiently to swallow
a few drops of port wine, which Mr. MInitlnnd had
ordered to be administered if she woke, and sunk
to sleep again. It was that deep, still, almost fearful
repose, for it is so like death, which we can scarcely

her waking hung hope or misery, return of intellect,
or its confirmed suspension. MIr. MIaitland had par-

verde her senses, that his presence might seem as
natural as either of her cousins; but he warned him that
the least display of agitation on his part, or reference
to the past, in ler exhausted state, might be fatal to
her. It was quite the evening. Widow Langford ad

to breathe freely, from the intensity of her hope that
llen would recover. And if such were her feelings,
what were eDward's and MIrs. HAmilton's? The former
was kneeling on the right of the bed, his eyes alter-
lately fixed on his sister, and buried in the core-
lid. MIrs. hAmilton was on the opposite side, close to
Ellen's pillow, the curtain draw so far back, that the
least change on her patient's countenance was discern-
able. HOurs after hour had so passed, the crimes that
told their flight scarcely leard by those anxious watchers.
It was about eight o'clock, when a slight movement in
Ellen made her aunt's heart so throb, as almost to
deprive her of breath; her eyes unclosed, and a smile,
such as Mrs. HAmilton had not seen for weeks, nay
months, circled ler lips.
 Dual Aunt, have l been ill? It seems such a long, long
time since l has seen you, and my head feels so strange,

Do not try to think yet, rling. You late been

you. Strength will soon return now, I hope, and then
your head will be quite clear again,'' replied Mrs.
HAmilton, quietly and caressingly, though she so
trembled with the change from including dread to cer-
tain hope, that she herself scarcely knew how she spoke
at all.
 But what made me so ill, Anne? I feel as if it were
some great pain; I cannot remember anything clearly,
but yet it seems as if I had bccn very unhappy,-and

That I did not love you, my Ellen indeed, that was

Close by you, love. He has been as watchful and

gien him a sad welcome, but you must make up for

Ellen looked lauguidly, yet eagerly round, as her
aunt spoke, and her gaze fixed itself on her brother, who
was struggling violently to suppress the emotion, which
at the sound of her voice, in connected words, near
overpowered him; and still more so,- when Ellen said,
more eagerly that she had yet spoken.-
 Dear Edward. come and kiss me, and do not look
so sad. I shall soon get well,''
He went over her, and kissed her repeatedly, trying
in in to say something,, but he felt so choked, ho

for a moment to Nurse LAngford, who had come to the
foot of the bad, and the seemed another face connected
with the blank past, and then it fixed itself again on
Edward, and her pale face so worked with the color
of thought, that MIrs. hamilton became alarmed. She
saw too that Edward was growing paler and paper,
and trembled for the continuance of his control. Taking
Ellen's hand gently from his, and arranging her pillow
at the same time, so as to turn her face rather from him,
she said, playfully-
 You have looked at Edward long enough, Ellen, to
be quite sure he is safe at home. So now I shall be
jealous if you give him any more of your attention and
select mc; yo must take some nourishment, and try
to go to sleep again, for I must not have you try your
strength too much.''
If I could but remember clearly,'' answered Ellen,
sadly; ' it is all so vague-so dark-but I do not think
it was only because he did not come, that made me so
unhappy.''
 You are not going to be disobedient, dearest,''
replied Mrs. Hamilton, firmly, though fondly, as she
hastily signed to edward to leave the room, which he
most thankfully did, never stopping till he renewed his
own, and tried to thank God to IIis great mercy, but
could only sob. :I told you not to think, because to
do so might retard return of strength, and indeed yo
must try and theme; you know Iam very peremtory
sometimes,'' And the fond kiss with which she enforced
the command seemed to satisfy Ellen, whose natural

submissiveness, combined with excessive physical week-
ness, caused her to obey at once, and not attempt to think
any more. She took the required nourishment with
returning appetite, and soon afterwards fell quietly and
apply to sleep again, her aunt's hand closely clasped
. in hers.
From that day, all fear of disordered intellect de-
parted, and gradually the extreme exhaustion gave way
before MIr. MIaitland's judicious treatment. Strength,
indeed, returned so slowly and almost imperceptibly,
that it was necessary to count improvement by weeks,
not days. And when, i weeks after her first seizure,
she was thought well enough to be carried to MIrs.
HAmilton's dressing-room, and laid on a couch there,
it was a source of gratitude and rejoicing to all. But
MIr. MIaitland and MIrs. Hamilton soon saw, and with
intense anxiety, that with the physical strength memory
and thought had not fully returned, and that their
consequence was a depression so deep, as effectually
to retard her perfect recovery. She seemed to shrink
from all attention, all kindness, as utterly unleserved,
even from er cousins. She would look at Edward
for half an hour together, with an expression of sun-
fearing, that made the heart actually ache. At times
she would receive MIrs. HAmilton's caressing and judi-
pious tenderness as if it were her only comfort, at
others, shrink from it, as if she had no right to it.
This will never do,'' M. Maitland said, about ten
days after Ellen's removal into her daily quarters, and

so, you refer to the past. She remembers it all too
clearly I fear, so our not alluding to it does no good.
You must be the physician in this case, my dear MIrs.
Hamilton, for I am powerless.''
But though she quite agreed with him, how to
approach such a very painful subject required no little
consideration, but, as is very often the case, chance does
that on which we have expended so much thought.
One afternoon Ellen lay so still, so pale, on her
couch, that MIrs. IlIamilton bent over her to listen if she
breathed, saying, as she did so, almost unconsciously-

Ellen hastily unclosed her eyes, for she was not asleep,
-it had been only the stupor of painfully-cngrossing
thought, rendering her insensible to all outward things,
but her aunt's voice aroused her, and it seemed an in-
expressible relief to feel they were quite alone. Trying
to rise, and clasping her hands, she said, in a one of
strong excitement-
Oh, Aunt Emmeline, how can I be happy-how
can I be well-when I think-think-that if it had not
been for my son, and the misery it brought me, Edward

It is a hard lesson to learn, and yet, Ellen, I think one
day, when you can look back more calmly on the last
few months, you will acknowledge with me, that great
as your suffering have been, they were sent in love, both
to him and to you.''
If they have saved him-saved him from a conti-
ance in error, and so made him happy-Oh, Aunt

Ellen did try to smile, but she was too weak to bear
this complete removal of a double burden without an
emotion that seemed more like pain than joy. She
Said her head on her aunt's shoulder, and wept without
restraint. They were the first tears she and shed since
her illness, and Mrs. HAmilton thanked God for them.
She did not attempt to check them, but the few words
she did speak told such affectionate sympathy, such
perfect comprehension of that young heart, that Ellen
felt as if a mountain of lend were dissolving from her.
'And now, my Ellen, that I have relieved you of a
painful dread, will you case my mind of a great
anxiety ?'' inquired Mrs. Hamilton, nearly an hour after-
wards, when Ellen second so relieved and called, that she
could talk to her without fcnr. `' You look surprised;
but it is a subject you alone can explain, and till it is

brow, as sle answered, faltcringly-

Tell me, when and how it was taken; and I think I can
prove to you that your poor mother would have re-

it had taken upon you.''
Thus encouraged, Ellen narrated the scene that had
taken place in Widow Morgan's cottage just before
Mrs. Hamilton arrived; and her mother's fears for
Edward, and dread of MIr. Hamilton, which it was very
evident, and now more than ever, had extended to both
for children. Sle said that Mr. Marvin's assurance,
that her mother could see, and would love her in

Norwood before it made her very unhappy, from its con-
stant interference with, and prevention of, her obedience
and duty to her aunt; that it had often caused hcr violent
headaches, only from her vain attempts to satisfy herself
as to that which she ought to do. When Edward first
 sent to sea, and all seemed so right and happy with
him, of course she became happier than she had ever
been before. Then came his difficulties, and her con-
fiction that she must save him and keep his secret.
That her reason and her affection often urged her to con-
fide all to her aunt, certain that she would not harshly
condemn Edward, but would forgive, and help him far
more effectually than she could; but sle dared not, for
whenever she thought thus the figure of her mother
rose before her, seeming to reproach and threaten her
for exposing the child she so deal led to disgrace
and ruin; and this was so vivid-so constant-during
his last appeal, that she thought she must be going
mad; that nothing but the dread of not being firm
enough to keep Edward's secret, had withheld her from
confessing her in at once to her aunt, especially when
her uncle had so solemnly denounced it as theft, and
that when it was discovered it seemed actual relief,
though it brought such severe punishment, for she
knew no suffering for her could be too severe.
The tale, as Ellen told it, was brief and simple enough,
and that there was any merit in such a system of
self-devotion neer seemed to enter her mind for a
moment; but to Mrs. IInmilton it revealed such an
amount of suffering and trial, such a quiet, systematic,

love should protect her in future from any such trial;-
and from what had it all sprung ' the misery of years,
at a period when life should be so joyous and so free,
that care and sorrow llc it as too purely and too briefly
happy to approach? From a few thoughtless words,
from a thoughtless partial mother, whose neglect and
dislike had pronounced that disposition cold, unloving
and inanimate whose nature was so fervid, so imagine-
tie, that the utmost care should have been taken to
prevent the entrance of a single thought or feeling too
precocious, too solemn for her years. It may be urged,
and with truth, that to an ordinary child the promise
might have been forgotten, or hecdlessly laid inside,
without any harm accruing from it, but it was from
not caring to know the rcnl character of the little
being, for whose happiness and virtue she was re-
possible, that the whole mischief sprung; and it is
this neglect of maternal duty, against which we would
so earnestly warn those who may not have thought about
it. It is not enough to educate the mind, to provide
bodily necessarily, to be indulgent in the gift of pleasure
and amusement, the heart must be won and taught;
and to do so with any hope of success, the character
must be transparent as the day: and what difficulty,
what hindrance, can there or ought there to be in ob-
training this important knowledge to a mother, from
whose recent the babe has received its nourishment,
from whose arms it has gradually slipped away to feel
its own independence, from whose lips it has received

All these thoughts pssel through Mre. Hamilton's

simple tale, as if unconsciously appealing for her pro-

as you have done by Elward? To see her suffer
pain and sorrow, and be led into error, too, sometimes,
to conceal Prey's faults, and prevent their removal,
when, by the infliction of some trifling pain, it would save
his exposing himself to greater?''

 BUt how can she, if they are not all equally de-

show his love, which I was afraid to do, though I did

Ellen's earnest face, on which joy and hope seemed
struggling with doubt, was sufficient answer.

ration in coldness from her father and myself, might all
have tended to weaken your mother's consciousness of
her duty, and so, without any fault in yourself, my
Ellen, hae occasioned her too great partiality for
Edward. But do you remember her last words ?''
Ellen did remember them, and acknowledged they
had so increased her affection for her mother, as to
render the promise still more sacred to her.
I feared so, dearest; but it is just the contrary effect
which they should have had. When she called on to her,
and blessed and kissed you as fondly as she did Edward,
she said she had done you injustice, had failed in her
duty to you, and it so greed her, for it was too late
to atone for it then; she could only pray to God to raise
you up a kinder parent. I hae trilogy be that, for her
sake, as well as your own; and will you not known-

Ellen's tears were falling fast and freely, but they
were hardly tears of pain. lIes aunt's words seemed
to disperse a thick mist from her brain and heart, and
for the first time, to satisfy her that she might dismiss the
painful memory of her promise, and dismiss it without
blue or disobedience to hcr mother.
MIrs. HAmilton had begun the conversation in them-

without undue condemnation of her sister; but as eLlen,
clasping hcr arms about her neck, tried to think ler

fervently, think God.

actually diseased. It was not at all surprising; for much
older and stronger and wiser persons would have expo-
experience the same, under the same pressure of grief,
and terror and remorse. But what can I o to cure
this morbid imagination, Ellen?'' she continued, play-
fully ; ` sentence you, as soon as you get well, to a

eI nm afraid my poor hand will be more stupid at

 Then I suppose I not think of something else.

IIcr playfulness had gien place to renewed earnest-

painful relapses which had so tried MIr. MIitland's skill

imagine what could so have altered their feelings towards
her, but with that evident gratitude and pleasure which
encourages a continuance of kindness. Emmeline was
always kind, but it was indeed happiness to feel she might
talk with and share her amusements, as in former days;
and that, instead of thinking she ought not to receive
her aunt's affection, the only thing she asked in return
was her full confidence. The irrepressible rest to poor
Ellen which that conversation gave is not to be describe.
It was so blessed, so soothing, that it seemed too un-

not feel towards her and eDward as her aunt did was its

MIr. Howard, which that worthy man insisted upon
having as soon as she was strong enough, to remove the
false impressions which his severity had given, and
with never ceased to grieve and reproach him, caused
his almost daily visits to be anticipated by her with as
much gladness as they had before brought dread.
`And now that anxiety for llen is at end, I must
have you take more care of yourself, Mrs. Hamilton.

Ellen was still upstairs. Morris and Ellis had once more
the happiness of their beloved mistress's superintendence,
and proud were they both, as if Caroline had bccn their
own child, to show all she has done, and so unostenta-
tedious, to save her mother trouble, when she had been
too anxious to think of anything but Ellen; and the
mother's heart swelled with a delicious feeling of grati-
tude to Him who, if in making her so acutely sensible
other solemn responsibility, had deepened and extended
anxiety, and had in the same measure heightened and
spiritunlized joy. The fruit was indeed worth the nur-

Intensely anxious as she felt herself, as did also MIr.
FOrward and Mr. Maitland, and, in fact, all Arthur
Hamilton's friends, she yet tried to sustain the spirits
of her children, for the young men had evidently grown
anxious on the subject too. It was not likely that the

leaving the island, and the young people eagerly grasped
the idea: so painful is it to youth to realize a cause for

such excessive mildness and closeness of atmosphere,
that it affected the health of any who were strong, and
not only made Ellen very languid, but frequently recalled

With every effort, and they were such as to bid the

crew of the hapless Siren quickly deserted her. Captain
Harvey was the last to descend, and, as he did so, a block
of iron, loosened from its place, fell cornerwise, and struck
sharply on Edward's forehead, almost stunning him for
the moment, as he watched the captain's descent. He
felt the blood slowly trickling down his temple and
cheek; but he was not one to be daunted by pain: he
resumed his station at the helm in unbroken silence,
only speaking wen directions were absolutely necessary,
and the only in a few brief sailor-terms. They hal
scarcely proceeded a third of their way, when the waters
boiled and formed as tossed by some strange whirlpool,
and it required all Elward's address and skill as steers-
mau to prevent the frail boat from being drawn into
the vortex. The case was soon displayed, and every
heart shouldered, for ten minutes later, and help would
indeed have been in vain. 1he unfortunate vessel had
sunk-been swallowed up in those rushing waters; the
section of so large a mass, producing for a brief interval
the effect of a whirlpool. The silence of age and of
intense thnnkfulness, fell on the heart of every man,
and more than all on his, who had so far recovered his
first emotion as to gaze wondering and admiringly on
the boyish figure at the helm, whose voice was utterly
unknown, and those features the fitful light, and the
youth's steadfast gaze on his rowers, prevented his
tracing with any certainty.
The crowds had increased on the shore, watching
with intense eageruess the return of the boat; but the

portentous reigned. A huge sea had concealed her for
several minutes, and Mr. Howard, who during these
two long hours had remained spell-bound on the beach,
groaned alone in his agony; again she was visible,
driven on with fearful velocity by the tide, nearer, nearer
still. IIe thought he could distinguish the figure of his
friend: he was sure he could hear the voice of Edward,
urging, commanding, directing a landing somewhere, in
contradiction to the opinion of others. They were
within a dozen yards of the shore, but still not a sound
of gratulation was heard. Every eye was fired, as in
the fascination of terror, on a wave in the distance, in-
creasing in size and fury as it rapidly approached. It
used the boat-it stood impending over the frail thing
as a mighty avalanche of waters-it burst; the boat
was seen no longer, and a wild and terrible cry sounded

OREBODINGS.
ThE role of the day MIrs. HAmilton had vainly tried to
shake offa most unwanted gloom. Convinced herself
that it was greatly physical, from the unusual oppressive-
news of the weather relaxing the ervcs, which had so
many months been overstrained, yet her thoughts
would cling to MIr. MIaitland's words, that her husband
might be coming home himself; but if the accounts of
Ellen's danger and edward's confession had recalled
him, he ought to have arrived full two or three weeks
previous. The game that swept round her, the awful
and unnatural darkness-the remarkable phenomena at
that season of lightning-and the long loud thunder-
claps' which inland could be fearfully distinguished
from the gale, appalled the whole household; and there-
for it was not much wonder that the age idea of
her husband's having left Faroe, and exposure to such

certainty of agony. It was well, perhaps, that her un-
selfish nature had an object to draw her in some slight
degree out of herself, for er firmness, her trust beyond
the accidents of earth, all seemed about to fail her, and
make her for the time being most wretched. As the
storm and closeness increased, so did Ellen's feverish
restlessness: her nerves, not yet full restored, felt
strung almost to torture, with every flash and clap and
blast. She tried to laugh at her own folly, for though
often terrified when a little child at the storms in India,
those of England had never affected her at all, and she
could not understand why she should feel this so child-
isil. But argument is of little moment in such cases;
and MIrs. Hamilton, satisfying her that she could no
more help her present sensation than her physical
weakness, tried to soothe and amuse her, and in so
doing partially cheered herself. She did not leave her
till past midnight, and then desiring Mrs. Langford to
sit up with her till she was comfortably asleep, retired to
her own bedroom. Never since her husband's absence had
its solitude felt so sst-so heavily oppressive; thought
after thought of him thronged her mind till she fairly
gave up the effort to struggle with them.  Will his

and the deep stillness, the gloom only broken by a
small siler lamp, and the fitful light of the fire seemed
but a solemn answer. She buried her face in her clasped
hands, and the clock struck two before that inward con-

and ler beloved ones; and after an ancestor voiceless
layer, she drew her little table, with its books of de-
motion to the fire, and rend thoughtfully, prayerfully,
for another hour, and then sought her couch. But she
could not sleep; the wind had again arisen, and fearing
to lie awake and listen to it would only renew her
usual agitation, she rose at four, dressed herself,
and throwing on a large shawl, softly traversed th
passage, and entered her niece's room; finding her, as
she fully expected, as wasteful and restless as herself,
with the addition of an intense headache. She and
persuaded Nurse Langford to go to bed, but the pain
had come on since then, and made her more restless
and feverish than fore. She could not lie in any
posture to gct ease, till at last, about six o'clock, com-
plenty exhausted, she fell asleep, sitting almost upright
in her aunt's arms, her head leaning against her as
she stood by the bedside. Tending to disturb hcr, MIrs.
HAmilton would not move, desiring the morning prayers
to be said without her, and MIss IlIarcourt and her
daughters not to wait breakfast, as she would be it
with Ellon when she awoke. That she was stiff and
exhausted with three hours' standing in one position she
did not heed, perhaps scarcely felt, for woman's lovelicst
attribute, that of a tcnde and utterly unselfish nurse,
was her to perfection. But she did not refuse the cup
of chocolate Caroline brought her herself, and with
affectionate enrnestness entreated her to take.

Caroline very unwillingly obeyed, and about a quarter
of an hour afterwards, Irs. HAmilton was started by the
sound of a carriage advancing with unusual velocity to
the house. It stopped at the main entrance, and the
ad scarcely time to wonder who could be such very
early visitors, when a loud scream in the voice of
Emmeline rung in her ears; whether of joy or grief
she could not distinguish, but it was the voice of her
child, and the already tortured nerves of the wife and
mother could not hear it without a sensation of terror,
amounting to absolute agony. She Said Ellen's head
tenders on the pillow, watched over her, though he
libs so trembled she could scarcely support herself,
saw with intense relief that the movement had not dis-
turned her quiet sleep, and calling MIrs. Langford from
an adjoining room, hastily descended the stairs, though
how she did so, and centered the breakfast-room, she
always said she never knew. Many and eager and gladly

the hall and threshold of the room, but all made a

IIis voice-his kiss-seemed to rouse the scattered
senses, even more effectually than Miss Harcourt's
anxiously proffered remedies; but she could not speak,
she only looked up in his face, as if to be quite, quite
sure he had indeed returned; that her vague fancies
of danger, even if they had foundation, had merged in the
most blissful reality, that she was no longer alone, and,
leaning hcr head on lis bosom, was only conscious of a
thankfulness too deep for words; a repose that, since his
departure, she had not known for a single day. Neither
she nor her husband could believe that it was only six
months since they had been separated. It seemed, and to
Mrs. Hamilton especially, as if schemes have livedthrougl
years in that time, it has been so fraught with sorrow.

tinted the affectionate girl, kneeling down by her
mother, and clinging to her, adding, in a suppressed

MIrs. Hamilton read in a moment that Emmeline's
playfulness was only assumed to hide strong emotion;
that she was trying very hard for complete control,
but so trembling, that she knelt down, literally because
she could not stand. It was such a proof of her en-

as pale as her own. `I will not submit to any scolding,

did she guess the whole.

keep away from him, even that short distance, but
neither she, nor either of the others, connecting her

silent kiss upon it, and looking alternately at him and
her husband, seemed powerless to realize any other

Mr. HAmilton briefly, but most eloquently, narrated
the events of the previous night, dwelling only suffix-
century on his imminent peril, to evince the real im-
importance of Edward's extraordinary exertions, not to
harrow the feelings of his listeners more than need be.
That the young officer's determined opposition to the
almost angrily expressed opinions of Captain HArvey
and Old Collins as to the better landing-place, had saved
them from the effects of the huge war, which had burst
like a water-spout a minute after they had all leaped in
safety on shore, almost overseeing the projecting sand
to which Collins had wished to direct the boat, and so
proving at once Edward's far superior nautical kno-
ledge, for and they steered there, the fail bark must
inevitably have been upset, and its crew washed by the
receding torrent back to sca. Slavery and Collins ac-
knowledge their error at once, and looked eagerly for
Edward to say so to him, but he had vanished the
moment they had achieved a safe landing, to Mr.
Hamilton's annoyance, for he had not had the least sus-
picion who he was, and only longed to express, if he could
not otherwise vince, his gratitude. Collins and Grey re-

nothing, not'in his name, not a man would have

to have guided the boat to and from the sinking vessel,
in such a sea, was so impossible, that noone would have
attempted it; Old Collins ending, with the superstition
of his class, by a declaration, that his disappearance con-
minced his already more than suspicion, that it was some
good angel in a boy's likeness; for Arthur Hamilton
would never have been permitted so to perish: an ex-
plantation, MIr. HAMilton added, lauglingly, that might
suit his Emmy, but was rather too fanciful for him.
However, lis oung preserve wasnowhere to be found,
but, to his extreme astonishment, and no little relief (for
now that he was so near home, his anxiety to hear of
all, especially Ellen, whom he scarcely dared hope to
find alive, became insupportable), MIr. Howard suddenly
stood before him, grasping both his hands, without the
power for a minute or two to speak. MIr. Hamilton
overwhelmed him with questions, scarcely going his
time to answer one before he asked another. They had
nearly reached the hotel, when Captain HArvey's bluff
voice was heard exclaiming-
 Here he is, MIr. Hamilton e is too exhausted to
escape our thanks and blessings now. What could the
youngster have tried to hide himself for?''
But before Mr. HAmilton could make any rejoinder,
save to grasp the young man's hands strongly in his
own, MIr, RIvard said, eagerly-
 Oblige me, Captain HARvey; take that boy into our
hotel, it is only just round the corner; make him take
of his dripping jacket, and give him some of your
sailor's stuff. He is not quite strong enough for his
cxertions to-night, and should rest at once.''

Captain BIzarre bore him off, almost carrying him,
for cxertion and a variety of emotions ad rendered line
faint and powerless.
 Do you know in, Forward? wonder what is he?''
Dut MIr. FOrward did not, perhaps could not reply, but
buried his friend on to the hotel; and entered the room,
where, having called for lights and all the ingredients of
gog-punch, which he vowed the boy should have instead
of the brand and water he had called for, they found
Edward trying to laugh, and protesting against all
cooling; he was perfectly well, and he would not goto
bed, and he could not imagine what right Captain
Harvey had to hc a sailor, if he thought so much of a
storm, and a low, and a wetting.
 Nor should I, if you were sailor-rigged; but what
business are you with this overgrown most of a figure,
and a face pale and delicate as a woman's ?''
And so like his dying mother it was, that Mr. FAmily-
ton stood for a moment on the threshold, completely
stupefiel. Believe our leaders to imagine the rest; and
how Captain Harvey carried the seemingly marvellous
news that the brave young officer was Mr, HAmilton'e
own nephew over the town, and in every fisherman's
but, in a miraculously short space of time.
We may as well state herc at once, to save farther
retrospective, that M, HAmilton, by the actie an ad-
mivrnble assistance of Morton, had, after a thee months'
residence at Faroe, perceived that he might return

a period for his return, knowing the comfort it would
be to his home; but M. MIlton could not bear the
idea of leaving his friend in his voluntary banishment
so may months sooner than they had reckoned on.
When, loveser, the letters name irom Norwood, detailing
Edward's return, and the discoveries thence proceeding,
his anxiety and, let it be owned, his extreme displeasure
against his nephew, prompted his return at once
MOrton not only conquered every objection to his
immediate departure, but tried, and in some measure
succeeded, to soften his anger, by bringing before in
many points in Mr. HOward's letter, showing real
good and true repentance in the offender, which a first
crystal of a narrative of error had naturally overlooked.
The seas, however, were so fearfully tempestuous and the
winds so averse, that it was impossible either to leave
Force, or get a letter conveyed to Scotland, for a full
fortnight after the Siren'last voyage. Nothing but the
extreme urgency of the case, increased by the fact that the
intention of the Siren nt Wick had given MIr. Hamilton

By the time they reached the lAnd's End-they had
come westward of eNgland instead of eastward as they

dition, that Captain RArely felt and acknowledged she
could not weather out another storm. The calm that
had followed the heavy gales gave hope to all; even
though the constant shifting of the wind, which was
now not more than what in sailor's parlance is called a
cat's-pa, prevented their making as much way as
they desired. At length they were within twenty miles
f Dartmouth, and not a doubt of their safety disturbed
them, until the darkening atmosphere, the sullen instead
suppressed roar of the billows, the wind solving and
wailing at first, and then bursting into that awful gale
which we have before described, banished every human
hope at once. Te rudder snapped, every half-hour the

slight figure with such immense exertions,-though some
time has passed, and a social, happy breakfast, round
which all still lingered, had enabled them to subdue too
painful emotion, and only to be conscious of the most
deep and grateful joy.
Pray do not call it disfiguring, Aunt; I am quite
proud of it. Last night I could have dispensed with
such a striking mark of affection from the poor Siren,
though I really hardly felt it, except that the blood
would trickle in my eye, and almost blind me, when I
wanted ally sight and senses too. But this morning

the room before any one could reply.
 But you will forgive him, Papa; you will try him
again; and I am sure he will be morally brave too,''
pleaded Emmeline; her sister and Miss HArcourt joining
in the entreaty and belief, and Mrs. HAmilton looking
in his face, without uttering a word. Mr. HAmilton's
answer seemed to satisfy all parties,
Allen meanwhile had awoke, quite refreshed, and all
pain gone, been dressed, and converted to her daily
quarters, the events of the morning entirely unknown to
her; for though the joyful news, spreading like wild-

enough, even without a message to that effect from

bending down, so that her face should come before her
sister instead of her copy, which was a very pretty small
marble figure.  Now, if you were not the most de-
remained piece of prose in the world, you would find
poetry seen in my face,
For, to the artist no more gazed
On features still and cold;

think a very pretty poem might be made of it. Look
at the variety of tasteful and useful things laid on a

moveable, cold, insensible, just like one of whom we
heap favours upon favours, and who remains so wrapped
in self as to be utterly indifferent to all. Now, Caroline,
put that into rhyme, or blank verse, if you prefer it;
it is a new idea at least.''
So new,'' replied her sister, laughing, ``that I
think I will send it to prey, and request him to turn
it into a Greek or Latin ode; it will be so much grander
than my English version. You have so astonished
MIamma, Emmeline, by your mad mood, that she has

I am so glad replied Emmcline, springing to her
mother's side; I like other people to be as idle as
myself.''
But there is a medium in all things, young lady,'
answered her mother, half gravely, half in Emmelinc's
own tone; ``and I rather think your conscience is
telling you, that it is not quite right to desert one Mouse
for another, as you are doing now,''

you-in plain words, only when you feel inclined-
you will fritter lile away without one solid thought or
requirement. ou think now, perhaps, habituated as
you are to employment, that this is impossible; but you
are just of an age to demand very strict watchfulness
over yourself to prevent it. Now that you are emerging
from the routine of childhood's lessons, and too old to
be compelled to do that which is right, and,-rendering
your task of control still more difficult,-more source-
title to poetry, and what you term inspiration, that her,
you must try and infuse a little of Caroline's steady
matter-of-fact into or poetry, instead of almost
despising it, as so cold and disagreeable. Now, do not
look so very sad and so very serious, love, and jump at
the conclusion that I am displeased, because I speak
seriously. I love our joyousness far too early to
check it, or is you to do so, especially in your own
family; but just as you have learned the necessity of,
and minced so well and so feelingly, control in emo-
tions of sorrow, my kmmeline, so I am quite sure you
ill trust my experience, and practise control, even in
the pleasant inspirations of poetry and joy.''
Emmeline sat very quiet for several minutes; she
was just in that mood of extreme hilnrity which renders
control excessively difficult, and causes the least check
upon it to be felt as harsh and unkind, and almost to
bring tears. She was not too perfect to escape feeling
all this, even though the person who had caused it was
the mother she so dearly loved ; but she did not give
way to it. A few minutes' hard struggle, and the

more than usually warm kiss, she promised to think
quite seriously on all her mother said, and, an effect far
more difficult, was just as joyous as before.

Mamma, I really do not think I can go on with it to-
day; to let me help you, I will take such pains with
my work, it shall be almost as neat as yours; and then,

talking.''
MIrs. HAmilton assented, telling her she might talk as
much as she pleased, with one of those peculiar silos of
approval which ever made Emmeline's heart throb, for
they always told her, that the thoughts and feelings,
and secret struggle with temper, which she imagined
must be known only to herself, her mother by some
mysterious power had discovered, and rewarded.

MIrs. Hamilton, so meaning, that Emmeline's ready

you, if you will only be very careful not to exaggerate

launched at one into a most animated description of
the storm and the shipwreck, and the rescue; cleverly
contriving so to hide all names, as to elude the least
suspicion of either the preserved or the preserve

moment, and clasping her arms round her brother's
neck, as he knelt by her, tried hard to prevent emotion,
but could not, and burst into tears.
 Tears, my little Ellen; I said I would only be
greeted with smiles,'' exclaimed a rich deep voice else
beside her, and before she had time to fear his presence,
she felt herself clasped with all a father's fondness in
her uncle's arms; er head resting on his shoulder,
and his warm kiss on her cheek.

In a very few minutes Ellen's composure was so fully
restored, and her henry dread so subsided, that the relief
seemed to her almost a dream. Could it be possible that

and pitiless to youthful error, who had drawn a chair
close by her sofa, and caressingly holding her hand in
his, and looking so kindly, so secretly, in her altered
face, was trying to amuse her by telling her so many
entertaining things about Faroe and In. Morton, and
his voyage home, and alluding to her brother's courage,
and prudence, and skill, in such terms as almost brought
the tears again Mr. HAmilton was inexpressibly blocked
nt the change which mental and bodily suffering had
brought in his niece. There is always something peru-
early touching and appealing to the best emotions in
youthful sorrow or suffering of any kind; and her trial
had been such an aggravated one-combining such
agonised remorse, for an act, which the harshest judg-
ment, knowing all points of the case, could scarcely
pronounced as other than involuntary, with the most
heroic but perfectly unconscious self-sacrifice, and
not only terror for her brother's fate, but an almost
crushing sese of misery for his faults,-that the pallid
face, and frame so delicately fragile, had still deeper
claims for sympathy and cherishing than even when
caused by ordinary illness. The loss of her unusually
luxuriant hair, except the soft bands which shaded hcr
face, visible under the pretty little lace cap, made her
look much younger than she really was, and so delicately
transparent had become her complexion, that the blue
veins were clearly traceable on her forehead, and throat,
and hands ; the nrl soft lash seemed longer than before,
as it swept the pale cheek, the brow more penciller,

expressive of such deep quiet feeling, that the whole
countenance was altered and so improved that it seemed
as if the heavy allow child was rapidly changing into
one of those sweet, loreable, heart-attracting girls, who,
without any actual beat, can never be passed un-
noticed.
At Ellen's earnest request, MIrs. HAmilton had, as soon
as she was strong enough, read with her, morning and
evening, the devotional exercises which were read below
to the assembled family. MIrs. Hamilton soon perceived,
and with no little pain, that Ellen shrunk from the
idea of being well enough to rejoin them, in actual
suffering. Here again was an effect of that same isis
imagination, of whose existence, until the late events,
in one so quiet, seemingly so cold, MIrs. Hamilton had
not the least idea of. Ellen had been so long aces-
timed to be silent as to her feelings, in fact, carefully
to conceal them, that much as she might will and
intend to be unreserved, her aunt feared it would cause
her some difficult to be so, and she could not hope
to succeed in controlling imagination unless she ere.
That night, however, Ellen's unreserved confidence gave
her hope. When the devotional exercises, in which
she had joined with even more than usual earnestness
and fervour, were concluded, she said, with almost
Emmeliue's confidence, as she said her hand on her
aunt's,
I am so very, very happy to-night, dear Aunt, that
I am afraid I do not think enough of that is past. I
did so trend my uncle's return-so tremble at what his
sentence would be on Edward and myself, that even

your kindness would not remove the weight; and now,
that I have found it all so groundless, and he is so kind
--so indulgent, I m so relieved, that I fcnr I must
have thought more of his anger than the anger of God.
MIy sin remains the same in IIis sight, though you and
Uncle HAmilton has so fully forgiven it, and-and-
I do not think I ought to feel so happy.''
 Indeed, my dear Allen, I think you may. Our
heavenly Father is still more merciful than man, as
M. Toward so clearly proved to you, in the long
conversation you had with him. We know, by His Holy
Word, that all He asks is sincere repentance for sin,
and a firm conviction that in Ilim only we are made
sufficiently righteous for our penitence to be accepted.
I believe, Ellen, that IIis forgiveness was yours, long
before I could give you mine, for He could read your
heart, and sns the reason of your silence, and all the
remorse and suffering, which, from the appearances
against you, I might not even guess; and that, in THis
compassionating love and pity, IIe permitted your in-
creased trial; ordaining even the failure of the relief to
Edward, to convince you, that, not even in such a fearful
case as yours, might error, however involuntary, prosper.
I can take His loving providence even in the fact of
your finding one more note than you wanted, that

seeming chance, was, humanly speaking, impossible. IIc

of joy or sorrow, to Him. Associate Him with your
very thought, and believe me, my own Ellen, your
very happiness will both law you nearer to Him, and
be an acceptable offering in his sight.''
Ellen listened eagerly, gratefully; she felt as if, with
every word MIrs. Hamilton said, the film of doubt and
ague fancies was dissolving from her mind, and, after
a short pause, she said-
1when you do not think, Aunt Emmeline, my
inability to pray for so long a time, was a proof that
God had utterly forsaken mel lt made me still more
wretched, for I thought it was a sure sign that I was
so irredeemably wicked, IIe had left me to the devices
of my own heart, and would never loe or have mercy
on me again. Eren after you lad quite forgiven me,
and proved to me my promise was a mistaken one and
not binding, I still felt the difficulty to pray, and it was
so painful.''
Such inability is very often so entirely physical,
my denr Ellen, that we must not think too much about
it. Our simple duty is to persevere, however little
satisfactory our devotions; and put our firm trust in
one heavenly Father, that He will eal us, and permit
His countenance so to shine upon us again, as to derive
comfort from our prayers. Your inability before your
illness was the natural consequence of MIr. Howard's
severe representations, which he has since assured me,
he never would have used, if he could have had the least
idea of the cause of your silence. Yon, my poor child,

and I am not at all astonished, that when you mst
cared for the comfort of prayer and trust, the thought
that by your silence you were failing in your duty to
me and so disobeying Gol, should utterly have pre-
vented it. Since yom severe illness the inability has
been entirely physical. As strength and peace return,
you will regain the power, and realize all its com-
fort. Try, and under all feelings trust in and love
God, and do not be too much elated, when you can think
seriously and pray joyfully, or too responding wen
both fail you. In ou present state, physical causes
alone, so often occasion these differences of feeling in
house of devotion, that if we thought too much about
them, we should constantly think long, and be very
miserable. Try and prove your desire to love and serve
God, in your daily convert and secret touts, my
Ellen, and you will be able to judge of your spiritual
improvement by action anl feeling, far more truly and
justly than by the moon in which you pray,''
The earncestness of truth and feeling was always so
impressed on Irs. Hamilton's manner, whenever she
addressed her youthful charge, that her simplest word
had weight. HAppy prince is it when youth-that
season of bewildering doubt and question, and visit,
often mistaken faucies, and too impctuous feeling-has

friend. WAy will not woman rise superior to the petty

A fortnight after Mr. Hamilton's arrival, Ellen was
well enough to go down stairs for part of the day, and
even to read and write little. She was so very anxious
to recommence her studies, which for so many months
had been so painfully neglected, that it was a great
trial to her, to find her head was not yet strong enough
for the necessary application. There were many, very
many priations and trials, attendant on conalescence
after so severe an illness, known only to Ellen's own
heart, and to her aunt's quick sympathy; and she very
quickly learned in them the meaning of Mrs. Hamilton's
words regarding religion in conduct and feeling, as
well as in prayer. She tried never to murmur, or dwell
on the wish for pleasures which were denied her, but
to think only on the many blessings which surrounded
her. It was not an easy task so to conquer natural
feeling, especially as the trial and its conquest was often
known only to herself; but the earnest wish, indeed,
to become holy in daily conduct, as well as in daily
prayer, never left her mind, and so enabled her at
length fully to obtain it.

Mrs, Collins is really a sensible woman. dO you

 Yes, my dear. She has brought up her own large
family and her poor orphan grandchildren so atm-
rally, in the midst of their extreme poverty, and bears
such a name for kindness, amongst her still poorer
neighbours, that I truly respect and admire her. Sle
is quite one of those in whom I have often told you
some of the very loftiest virtues are to be found; and

I do not quite agree with you, Emmeline,'' said
Caroline, smiling.
 Not you, Lina, who eer thought you would? by-

poor man's cottage in my life, What were you saying
to Dame Collins? actually holding her hand, and some-

was at her side in a moment, with an arm round er
neck.

tease you; only it was unusual, was it not?''
I was trying to tell MInds. Collins all I thought of her
husband's share in saying our dear father, Emmy. I

 Yon are very seldom proud now, dearest Lina, and
I was the foolish one not to have guessed what you
were saying, without tormenting you. MIamma, do
you know I have such an admirable plan in my heal ?''
First tell Manmma,'' interrupted Caroline, that
WIlliam Gray has chosen to be a partner with Collins in
the more extended fishing and boating business, which
Papa has secured them, instead of entering into busi-
ness by himself; this has been settled since you were
there, I think.''
 Yes, my dear, I did not know it ; but Mrs. Collins
must like it, for she regretted very much that her sons
were all scattered in different trades, and her little
grandson, whose taste pointed to the sea, not old enough
to go out with his grandfather.''
 But only listen to my plan, MIamma, earl William
Gray and Susan Collins cannot possibly see much of
each other, without falling in love; and they will make
such an industrious pretty couple, and Papa will give
them a cottage to themselves, and I will go to their
wedding l''
Just such a plan as I should expect from your
giddy brain, Emmy. But how do you know that Gray
has any desire for a wife?'
 Oh, because Edward said he could not help remark-
ing, even in the midst of that awful scene, how mourn-
fully he said, he would bear a hand, for he had neither
mother, sister, nor wife to pipe for him; now if he mar-
rio Susan, he would have a very pretty wife to lament
him

Poor Susan, I fancy sle wouldrather not become his

Oh, but MIamma deal you know that I dont mean
exactly and only that; somebody to be interested for
him, and love him. No one can be happy without
that.''
` Susan was telling me, Mamma, how thankful sheds
to you, for finding her and her sister employment,
that they might be able to help the family,'' rejoined
Caroline. I was quite pleased with her manner of
speaking, and she brushed so pretty when MIss
Harcourt praised the extreme neatness of her work,''
 Al, MIamma, if you could but hear all they say of
you:'' again burst forth Emmeline, who it seemed
could not be quiet, going from one subject to an-
the with the same eager zest; 'if you had but

pride, when he saw on enter their former miser-
able hut, and sitting down on an old sea-chest, in-
it her to tell, and listened to all her troubles, just
as if you had been er equal, and left such comfort and
such hope behind you, as had not been theirs for many

and respect is so easy, so delightful, that there is no
merit in obtaining it. We ought only to be thankful,
when granted such a station and such influence as will
permit extended usefulness and thought for others,
without wringing our own.''
 Yes; but, Miamma, many people do a great deal of
good, but somehow or other they are not called,''
 Because, perhaps, in their earnest desire to accom-
polish a great deal of good, they may not think quite
enough of little things, and of the quick sympathy with
other person's feelings, which is the real secret of win-
ning love, and without which, sometimes even the
greatest benefit is not valued as it ought to be. But
did you see Old Collins likely?'
 He came in just before we left, and was so delighted
to see Papa sitting in his inglenook, and only wished
Edward had been there too,''
And where is your father'' asked Mrs. Hamilton.
Did he not return with you ?''
 Yes, but Edward wanted in, and they are in the
library. I am quite certain there is some conspiracy
between them; these long private interviews bode no
good. I shall scold Papa for being so mysterious,''
said Emmelinc.
I rather think he will return the benefit, by scold-
ing you for being so curious, Emmy. But here is
Edward, so the interview to-day has ot been very

And we did you not tell us ?''
Because I did not think it would particularly in-

earnestly at her brother all the time he spoke, and then
turned her face away, and a few quiet tears trickle
down her cheek. Edward's arm was very quickly round

assurances, united with his conviction that it would
still be a whole month, perhaps more, before he
should be summoned, as he had never to remain with
his family till the ea ucen as ready to said, that she
rallied her spirits, and, after remaining very quiet for an
hour, which was always her custom when she had had
any struggle with herself, for the frame felt it,-though
neither word nor sign betrayed it,-she was enabled
fully to enjoy the grand delight of the caning-Percy
and Herbert's arrival.
Easter week was indeed one of family joy and thank-
fulness, not only that they were all permitted once more
to be together, but that the heavy clouds of sin and sun-
firing had rolled away from their roof, and pleasure of
the sweetest, ost enduring, because most domestic
kind, reigned triumphant. Percy's astonishment at
Edward's growth, and the alteration from the handsome,
joyous, rosy boy, to the pale, almost care-worn looking
youth (for as long as Ellen bore such rigid traces, of
all she had endured for his sake, and was, at it were, the
constant presence of his errors, Edward tried in vain to
recover his former spirits,) was most amusing.

self, ``it is not much wonder.''
The lays passed much too quickly. Emeline wished
a dozen times that the days would be twenty-four instead
of twelve hours long. The weather was so genial that it
added to enjoyment, and allowed Ellen the delight,
known only to such prisoners to sickness as she had
been, of driving out for an hour or two at a time, and
taking gentle walks on the terrace and in the garden.
The young men were to return on the MOnday, and on
the Saturday previous a little excursion had been
planned, to which the only drawback was that Ellen
as not quite strong enough to accompany them: it
is to visit Alice Seaton, whom we mentioned in a
former chapter. Mr. HAmilton had succeeded in find-
ing ber brother lucrative employment with a lawyer in
one of the neighbouring towns, a few miles from where
she and her aunt now lived, enabling young eaton to
spend every Sabbath with them; and Alice now kept a
girl's school on her own account, and conducted herself
so well as never to want scholars. It had been a long
promise to go and see her, the drive from Norwood
being also most beautiful; and as she and her brother

were both at home and at leisure the last day in Easter,
it had been fixed upon for the visit. Percy was revealing
in tlc idea of driving his mother and Miss HArcourt in
a new barouche, and the rest of the party were to go on
horseback. But a dispute had arisen who should stay
with Ellen, and Edward insisted upon it, it was His
right, and so they thought it was agreed.
I wish, dear Percy, you would prevail on Edward
to accompany you,'' pleaded Ellen, fancying herself alone
with him, not seeing HErbert who was reading at a
distant table.
I wish, dear Ellen, you were going with us,'' he
answered, mimicking her tone.
 But as I cannot make him go. It always makes
him more unhappy when I am prevented any pleasure
than it does myself; and I cannot bear to keep him by
me four or five hours, when this lovely day, and the
exercise of riding, and, above all, your company, Perey,
would make him, at least for the time, almost his own
merry self again.''
 Thanks for the implied compliment, cousin mine,''
replied Percy, with a low bow.

myself enough, I can tell you, and I owe you a grudge
for doing so.''
Dear Percy, what can you mean? If you knew
how hard I find it to be patient sometimes, you would
not praise me.''
I mean that the last time I was at one, I was
blind and cruel, and added to your sufferings by my
uncalled-for harshest, and never had an opportunity
till this moment to say, now grieved I was-when the
truth was known.''
`Pray do not say anything about it, dear Perey,''
entreated his cousin, the tens starting to her eyes, as
he kissed her warmly; ' it was only just and natural
you should have felt indignant with me, for causing
Aunt Emmeline so much misery, and alloying all the
enjoyment of your holidays. I am sure you need not
reproach yourself;--but will you make Edward go?''
I it really will oblige you, Ellen; but I do not

he met Herbert.
You need not go, Perey,'' he said, smiling; ``my
ungracious cousin would not depnte me as her mes-
senger, but I made self such, and so successfully
that Edward will go, Ellen.''

to-day quite equal to riding? If your looks were as
gracious as your words, I would run away from you
into my own room; but as they are rather more gratifying
to my self-love, we will send them all away, and enjoy
our own quick pleasures and your little die together,
Well.''
Whatever Ellen might have said to convince him she
could be happy alone, the beaming look of pleasure on
her countenance satisfied all parties as to the excellence
of this arrangement; and happy, indeed, the day was.
Herbert seemed to understand her expressed feelings
so fully; and that always makes the charm of convert-
nation, whatever its subject. We do not require the e-
pression in words of sympathy,-it is an indescribable
something that betraysits existence. Favorite authors-
and Herbert was almost surprised at Ellen's dawning
taste and judgment in literature-the delights of Nature
after a long confinement, as if every flower were more
sweet, every bit of landscape, or wood, or water more
beautiful, and the many holy thoughts and pure joys
springing from such feelings, were all discussed, either
costly in their sitting-room, or in their ramble in the
garden; and after Ellen's early dinner, which HErbert
shared with her as lunch, she proposed what she
knew he would like, that her drive should be to Groevillc
Manor, and they might spend a full hour with their
friends, and yet be back in time. Herbert assented
gladly; and the warm welcome they received, Mrs

Greller's kind care of Ellen, and Mary's eager chat
with her and Herbert, and the number of things they
seemed to find to talk about, made the hour literally
fly ; but Herbert, enjoyable as it was, did not forget his
charge, and wrote her back to Norwood, while the sun
still shone bright and warmly: and when the party re-
turned, which they did only just in time to dress for
dinner, and in the wildest spirits, the balance of pleasure
at home and abroad, would certainly have been found
quite equal.
Ellen still continued quietly to lie down in her
own room while the family were at dinner, for she
was then sufficiently refreshed to join them for a few
hours in the evening. Percy and Emmeline, at dinner
that day, kept up such a fire of wit and mirth, that it
was somewhat difficult for any one else to edge in a
word, though Edward and Caroline did sometimes con-
trie to bring a whole battery against themselves. Just
as the dessert was placed on the table, however, sounds
of rural music in the distance, dancing nearer and
nearer, caused Percy to pause in his wild allies, and
spring with Edward to the window, and their class-
nations soon compelled all the party to follow their
example, and send for Ellen to see the unexpected sight
too. Banners and persons floated in the sunshine, and
the greater part of the nautical inhabitants of Dartmouth
were marshalled in goodly array beside them, headed
by Captain harvey and his crew, with Old Collins in
the midst of them; they were all attired in the new
clothing which MIr. Hamilton had presented to them;

face, the very peculiar curls in which his rally yellow
hair was twisted, and the quid of tobacco, from which
even, on this grand occasion, he could not relieve his
mouth and creek. A band of young men and girls
surrounded the first banner, which, adorned with large
bunches of pserimos and violets up the staff, bore the
words `` IInmilton and Benevolence;'' and amongst
them Emmeline speedily recognized William Grey and
Susan Collins, walking side by side, she looking down
and smiling, and he so earestly talking, that she this-
perez to her mother with the greatest glee, that her
plan would take place after all. Then came a band of
sturdy fishermen, chums and messages of Collins,
and then a band of boys and girls, from all MIr. Hamilton's
own village schools, decked in their holiday attire, and
holding in their hands tasteful garlands of all the
spring flowers they could muster, and bearing two large
banners, one with the words,  Fortescue for every All

of the scene on the beach that eventful night, and the

they halted; the music ceased, and cheer on cheer re-
sounded, till the very echoes of the old park,were startled
out of their sleep, and sent the shout back again. Percy
was amongst them in a moment, singling out Old Collins,
whom he had tried repeatedly to see since is visit
lome, but never found him, and grasped and shook
both his hands with the full vehemence of his character,
pouring out the first words that chose to come, which
better expressed his grateful feelings to the old man
than the most studied speech. William Grey had already
received substantial proofs of his gratitude, and so he
had then only a kind nod, and a joke and look at the
pretty, blushing Susan, which said a vast deal to both,
and seemed as if he quite seconded Emmelinec's plan,-
mingling joyously with all,-he had bluff words, after
their own hearts, for the men, smiles for the maidens,
and such wild jokes for the children, as lost them all
decorum, and made them shout aloud in their glee.
Herbert seconded him quite as well as his quicker
nature would allow. Edward had hung back, een
hen his name was called outlustily, as if he could not
bear such homage.

be half complete without ou,'' whispered MIrs. FAmily-

The cloud dispersed from brow and heart in a mo-

almost as Percy, while the cheer which greeted him
was almost overpowering to his sister, so much humble
yet earnest feeling did it speak.
You really should have given us timely notice of
your intentions, my good friend,'' said Mr. HAmilton,
warmly grasping Captain Harvey's hand. ` At least
we might have provided some substantial represent
after your long march, as I fear we have but slender
fare to offer you, though Ellis and Morris are busy
already, I m happy to see.''
Anl urged on by their own delight at this homage both
to their master and his young preserve, who has
become a complete idol amongst them, a long table was
speedily laid in the servants' hall, covered with a variety
of cold meats, and bread and cheese in abundance, and
horns of cydcr sparkling brightly beside each trenches.
Fruit and cakes eagerly sought for by Emmeline, were
by her distributed largely to the children, who remained
variously grouped on the lawn, their glee at the treat
lieightenedby the sweet and gentle manner of its bestowal.
Captain HArvey and his mate, Mr. HAmilton enter-

hour and a half of thorough enjoyment-for thein

in the same spirit as it had been tendered-the procession
marshalled itself in the same order as it had come; and

IIis own at this time gae universal satisfaction.
The talents of his sisters had been so cultivated, as a
means of enhancing home-happiness, and increasing
their own resources, that their musical evenings were
always perfect enjoyment. Caroline, indeed, improved
as she was, still retained her love of admiration suffix-
society, to find still greater enjoyment in playing and
singing when there were more to listen to her, than
merely her own fairy, but the feeling, in the security
and pure atmosphere of Lakewood, was kept under control,
and she seoul find real pleasure in gratifying her brothers,
though not quite to the same extent as Emmeline.
Percy, after comfortably settling Ellen, threw himself
on the most luxurious chair he could find, stretched out
his legs, placed his head in what he called the best
position for listening and enjoying, and then called for
duets on the harp and piano, single pieces on both, and
song after song with the most merciless rapidity.
 Your sisters shall neither play or sing to you any
more,'' his mother, at length, lauglingly said, ``unless
you rouse yourself from this disgraceful idle fit, and
take your lute, and join them.''
Mother, you are lost to every sensation of mercy
after all my exertions, where am I to find breath?''

It was so very close to him as he approached the

placed it on it, and two or three very pretty trios were
performed, Percy declared with professional clat.
Now don't go, Percy, we want your voice in a song.

Caroline, I have not the genius to sing at sight.''
Of, you have often. and the words will inspire you.
Come, Herbert, we want you, too; Elward's singing
voice has deserted him, or I should enlist him also.
Emmeline, what are you waiting for ?''
I cannot sing it, dear Caroline; do not ask me,''
answered Emmeline, with a confusion and timidity,
which at home were perfectly incomprehensible.
 WHy, my little Emmy, I am quite curious to hear this
new song; do not disappoint mel'' said her father, in-
couragiogly.
 But after Caroline I cannot sing worth hearing,'
still pleaded Emmeline.
 MIy dear child, I never heard you make such a

find any difference in the pleasure that listening to
your music bestows, however one performer may be
more naturally gifted than the other.''

The words, however, speed sufficiently satisfactory
for them readily to join in it. Emmeline still hesitated,
almost painful; but then gathering courage, she sat
down to her harp, and, without any notes before her,
played a few bars of one of those sweet thrilling Irish
melodies, so suited to her instrument, and then com-
merced her song, the sweetness of her voice, and clear-
ness of articulation atoning well for her deficiency in
the power and brilliant which characterized her sister.
The words were exceedingly simple, but sung with deep
feeling, and heart-appealing as they were, from the
subject, we hope our readers will judge them as
leniently as Emmeline's hearers.

Emmeline's voice had at first trembled audibly, but
seeming to derive courage from her sister and brother's
accompaniment, which, from their knowledge of music,
was so beautifully modulated as to permit her sweet
voice to be heard above all, and every word clearly
distinguished, it became firmer and more earnest as she
continued, till she forgot everything but the subject of
her song. For full a minute there was silence as she
ceased, but with an irresistible impulse Mr. Hamilton
rose from his seat, and, as Emmeline left her harp, he
clasped her in his ars.
 How can I thank you, my Emmeline, and all
my children, for this fond greeting?'' he exclaimed,
with more emotion than le generally permitted to be

Percy, as Emmeline, breaking from her father, sat down
on her favorite stool at her mother's feet, and his her face
in her lap. Mrs. Hamilton laid her hand caressingly
on those soft curls, but, though she smiled, she did
not speak.
She will not tell, and you will none of you guess,''
said Caroline, laughing.
e You are in the secret, so out with it,'' said Edward.
 Not I; I am pledged to silence.''
Mother, dear, tell us for pity,'' pleaded HErbert.
I can only guess, for I am not in her confidence, I
assure you,'' she replied, in the same playful tone, and
raising lmmeline's lowered hand, she looked a moment
in those conscious eyes.  Dictated by my Emmeline's
affectionate little least, they were found in this pretty
shape, in the recesses of her own fanciful brain-is not
that it, dearest?''
There, Emmy, I knew Mamma would find it out,
however we might be silent,'' saidCaroline, triumphantly,
as her sister's face was again concealed.

with a most affectionate kiss; and her mother looked at

answered kmmeline, forgetting, in her surprise at her

simply.

And so I transform oneMIuse into another,'' exclaimed
Peres, who, in his sister's absorbed attention, had neared
her unobserved, and catching her round the waist, bore
her to the upper end of the room, and n minute after-
words she was enjoying her waltz, with as much childish
glee, as if neither poetry or reflection could hae
anything to do with her.
Why is poetry a dangerous gift, dear Aunt?'' in-
quires Ellen, who had listened earnestly to all Mrs.
HAmilton had said.
' BEcause, my love, it is very apt to excite and en-
courage an over-excess of feeling: gives a habit of
seeing things other than they really are, and engenders

poetry. To an well-regulated and and temper, the
danger is not of the same serious kind, as to the irgun-
later, but merely consists, in the powerful temptation
it too often presents to neglect duties and deployments
of more consequence for its indulgence. There is a
species of fascination in the composition of even tlc
most inferior poetry, which urges its pursuit, as giving
so little trouble compared to the perseverance necessary
for music and drawing, and such a vast amount of
pleasure, that it is difficult to withdraw from it. ThiS
is still more strongly the case when the young first
become conscious of the gift, as Emmeline is now. As
she gets older, and her taste improves, she will not be
satisfied with her efforts, unless they are very superior
to the present, and the trouble she will take in correct-
in and improving, will remove a great deal of the
too dangerous fascination attending it now; still I am
not anxious, while she retains her confidence in my
affection and experience, and will so control thc enjoy-
mint, as not to permit its interference with her the
more serious employments.''
Ellen listened early, and they continued conversing
on many similar topics of interest and improvement,
till the prayer-bell rung, and startled her into the recollec-
tion, that she had always retired nearly an hour before,
mud so had avoided entering the library, which she still

MIs. IInmilton had neer ceased to regret the dis-
grace she had inflicted on Ellen, in not permitting her
to retain her own place with the family, at least in the
hours of devotion, for it seemed more difficult to remove
that impression than any of her other trials. Returning
he niece's startled look with one of the sincerest affect-
tion, she said-

was directed towards her by the assembled household,
the greater part of who had not seen her since the
right of Edward's confession; and the alteration in her
appearance, the universal sympathy which her danger-
ous illness and its cause had cnlle forth, even in the
humblest and most ignorant-for it is the heart, not the
mind, which is required for the comprehension of self-
devotion-her very youth seeming to increase its magna-
tude, lad inspired such a feeling of love, that could she
have known it, would have prevented that painful sense-
tion of shyness.
MAny, many thoughts thronged her mind, ns hcr
uncle's impressive voice fell on her ear; thoughts,
which though they prevented her following the words
of the players, and caused the tens, spite of every effort,
to stream through her slender fingers, yet turned into
thankfulness and praise, ere the service ceased, that fiery
as the ordeal had been, she could still recognize a hand
of love, and bless God, not only for the detection of her
involuntary sin, but for every pang she had endured.
The next day was Sunday, bringing with it all sorts of
quiet sober pleasures of its own, only allowed by the
thought that it was the last day of Perey's and HErbert's
visit. The following morning they started for Oxford,
MIr. Hamilton and Edward intending to accompany
them part of the way, and then proceed to Ashburton,
where the former had business, and then make a little
tour through Plymouth home. The next day was so
beautifully fine and genial, that Emmeline declared it
would lo allen the greatest possible good to go with
her a few miles out of the park, to see a waterfall she

the sky more brilliantly blue, than they ever had been be-

down a black rock, and threw up spray, which the rays
of the sun rendered so beautifully iridescent, as to seem
like a succession of rainbows, was a whole volume of
poetry in itself.

Miss Harcourt and I could only see two men on horse-

Ellen, (whom her aunt now observed looked agitated aud

MIr. HAmilton and Edward entered almost mime-
lately afterwards, the latter evidently very much
agitated, the former so tranquil and cheerful, that the
momentary density of his wife was calmed directly. IIe
laughed nt their bewilderment, and said that an im-
portant letter had reached him at Ashburton, summon-
ing him to plymouth, and so he thought he would just see
low all was going on at Norwood first. This was not
at all a satisfactory reason from MIr. IInmilton. Edward
evidently tried to answer Ellen's inquiries quickly, but
he could not, and excliming, ` You tell hcr, my car
Uncle I cannot,'' ran out of the room. MIr. IIumilton
instantly changed lis jesting miner, so far as quietly
and nflcctionnately to sent his niece beside him, and tell
her cautiously and kindly the real cause of their uses-

to sail much sooner than as expected, and therefore
e hal deferred his business, and return with Edward
directly.
It is a trial, my dear Ellen, a very hard one just now,
under all circumstances; but i am sure you will bear
it with fortitude, for Edward's sake. The only draw-
back to his happiness in being again permitted to for-
low his profession, is the thought of the trial it will be

of quiet sorrow, her uncle could not for the moment
reply.

A low cry escaped involuntarily from Ellen's lips, as
she buried her face on the cushion of the couch where
she was sitting, and an exclamation of surprise and re-
gret broke for all. MIrs. Hamilton felt it almost as
much as allen, from to only her own unspoken anxiety,
as to whether indeed his home influence would see
him from temptation in future, but that she could enter
into every thought and feeling which in Ellen mst so
aggravate the actual parting,-always a sorrow in itself
After a few minutes Ellen raised her head, and, though
er cheek was perfectly colourless, very tear was
checked.

Emmline,'' she said, trying hard to speak quite cally.
Only beg him to come to me, that we may spend the

ling sorrow, to enter into his naturally glad anticipations,
that her brother felt as if he could not loe, nor ene-
rate her enough.
IIe was obliged to leave Norwood (accompanied by
his uncle) so early the next morning, that all his pre-
operations had to be complete by that night. Ellis's
activity, though she could not endure the ideas of his
going, speedily and satisfactorily settled that matter.
Robert Langford, who had only regained his natural
light-headedness since Ellen had taken her usual place
in the family, always declaring is recklessness had been
the origin of all her misery, was another so active in his
service, that Edward had only to give a hint of anything

distance, and it was instantly obtained.
Thc hours wore on, the evening devotions were con-
clouded, but still the family lingered in the library: so
many things there seemed to say, for MIr, HAmilton and
MIss HArcourt would not let the conversation flag, and
Edward would talk and laugh as if he were only going
from home for a few days. Midnight chimes, but still
MIrs. Hamilton felt as if she could not give the signal
for separation: but when one struck, there was a
general start, and an unanimous declaration it could not
be so late.
 I assure you it is,'' Mrs. Hamilton cheerfully said;
``and poor Award will get no sleep, if we do not scpa-
rate at once. IIe must certainly send you a box of art-.
facial roses, for this unusual dissipation will bear all the
natural ones way. Ellen, love, I must be cruel enough to
resist that pleading look; remember, your full strength
as not yet returned.''
She spoke kindly, but firmly, and there was a general
move. award lughingly promised to send his cousins
the very best box of rouge he could procure at Pl-
mouth, and wished them good night as gaily as if they
should meet as usual the next morning. Once only his
voice faltered,- llen, love, good night My own
sister, God in INvent bless you?'' were all he said, the last
sentence escaping as if involuntarily, as if he hl merely
meant to say good night; and for more than a minute
the brother and sister were claspedin inch other's arms.
There were tears in Mrs. Hamilton's eyes, and her

husband's were most unwontedly dim, for words were
not needed to reel to them the trial of that moment
to those two young hearts. To Ellen's especially, for
her lot was women's-to endure until time should prove
the reality of Edward's resolution, ad mark him indeed
the noble character his disposition so fondly promised.
IIis was active service, the banishment of thought by
dee. Breaking from her brother, and not daring to
address either her aunt or uncle, lest hcr control should
fail her too soon, Ellen hastened from the room.

 She will be better alone a little while, my dear boy;
young as she is, she knows where to seek and find com-
fort, and her tears will flow more freely, conscious only
of the presence and healing of her God. I shall not
part from you now. Ellis wanted me for some directions
about your things, and I will come to you in your room
afterwards,''
MIrs. hAmilton knew thc huan heart well. When she
went to Ellen, the paroxysm of natural sorrow had had
ent, and her sympathy, her earnestly expressed con-
action, that the trial of bcholding error and remorse in
one so beloved would not occur again, could bring com-
fort. The tears indeed might still are flowed the faster
perhaps at the voice of kindness, but there was ealing
in them; and when her aunt left her to go to eDward,

a few days would be happy, quite happy, for his sake.
It was late before MIrs. HAmilton quintet hcr nephew.
We will not repeat all that passed between them, all
that that fond, watchful relative so earnestly, so ap-
appealing said. Not much in actual words of counsel
hd she ever before addressed him, feeling that that
duty was better performed by Mr. Forward and his
uncle. She has simply tried to influence him by the
power of love, of forbcnrance, of sympathy with his re-
morse, and pity for his errors. In the wretcheduess,
the fearful anxiety, llen's danger and painful illness
had occasioned herself individually, she had near
spoken, or even let full a sentence which could reproduce
him as the cause of all; and therefore, now that she
did give her anxious affection words, they were so
spoken, that her nephew neer forgot them.

with interests and temptations of its own. 1ake this

eighteen years, and to nonebut to yourself ould I part

so for its own sake. It bears a name within it which I
think will eer ccp it sacred in your care, as it has

Edward opened it eagerly,  Charles Makers l'' he

seemed to hill me with a ague foreboding, which was
only too soon realized. I never saw him again; and
that little book indeed released in value.''
Iler voice faltered, for een yet the memory of her
brother was so dear to her that she could never speak of

surface that it should be equally valuable to him,

of years. But painful as it is, we must separate,
Elward: I must not detain you from rest and sleep
any longer. Only give me one promise,-if ever you
are led into temptation and error again, and it may be-
for our strongest solutions sometimes fail us-write to
me without the smallest hesitation, openly, freely; tell
me all, and if you need and, as it, and I will give it;
and, if it be possible, avert your uncle's displeasure. I
have no fear that, in telling you this, I am weakening
your resolution, but only to prevent one fault become-
in many by concealment-from dread of anger, and
therein the supposed impossibility of amendment.
Remember, my beloved boy, you have a claim on me
which no error nor fault can remove; as, under Prove-
dence, the preserve of my husband, I can never change
the anxious love I bear you. You my indeed male me

or error, small or great, you will rise to me as you

Edward did promise, but his heart was so full he
could not restrain himself any longer, and as MIrs.

With Ellen, too, lrs. IInmilton's anxious care was

fluences of her childhood, and their increased effect from
a morbid imagination, produced from constant suffering,
appearing indeedabout to be holly eradicated. Anxious
to remove all said associations connected with the
library, MIrs. Hamilton, having determined herself to
superintend yEllen's studies, passed long mornings in that
ancient room with her, so deligltfully, that it became
associated only with the noble authors whose works, or
extracts from whom, she read and recalled in, and

which filled er mind with such new thoughts, such
expansive ides, such calling and earnest truths, that
she felt becoming to herself a new being. Lively and
thoughtless as Emmcline she could not now indeed
become, alike as their dispositions naturally were; but
she was more quietly, enduringly happy than she had
ecr remembered herself.
here was only one alloy, one had thought, that would
intrude, causing a resolution, which none suspected;
for, open as she had become, she could breathe it to
one but Ellis, for she alone could assist her, though it
required many, many pcrsuasions and many assurances,
that she never could be quite happy, unless it was
accomplished, which could prevail on her to grant it.
Ellen knew, felt, more and more each week, that she
could not rest till she had laboured for, and obtained,
and returned into her aunt's hands the full sum she
had so involuntarily appropriated. The only means
she could adopt demanded such a seemingly intern-
nablc period of self-denial, patience, and perseverance,
that at first, as Ellis represented and magnified all con-
cited with it, she felt as if indeed she could not nerve
herself for the task, much as she desired to perform it;
but prayer enabled her to face the idea, till it lost its
most painful aspect, and three months after Edward's
departure she commenced the undertaking, resolved
that neither time nor difficulty should deter her from
its accomplishments. WHat her plan was, and whether
it succeeded, we may not here inform our readers.

Greatly to Caroline's delight, the following October
was fixed for them to lease Harwood, and, after a
pleasant tour, to make the long anticipated visit to
London. There would then be three or four months quiet
for her to have the benefit of masters, before she was
introduced, and MIrs. Hamilton fondly hoped, that the
Last year's residence at home, fraught as it had
been with so much of domestic trial, and displaying
so many hopeful and admirable traits in Caroline's
disposition, would have lessened the danger of the
ordeal of admiration and gaiety which she so
dreaded for her child-whether it had or not, a future
page 'ill disclose.
1o Emmeline this arrangement was a source of ex-
treme regret individually, in which Ellen now quite
sympathised. lUst Emmeline had never forgotten her
mother's gentle hint, that too great indulgence of regret
or sorrow becomes selfishness, and she tried very hard
to create soe anticipation of pleasure, een in London.
Ellen would not look to pleasure, but merely tried to
think about-and so, when called upon, cheerfully to
resign that which was now so intensely enjoyable-her
studies with her aunt; and so benefit by them, as to give
MIss HArcourt no trouble when she was again under her
care; as she knew she and Emmeline must be, more than
they had been yet, when Caroline' s introduction, and
their residence in London, would take Ir. and MIrs.

pleasures, and, even when at home, compel them to be
so frequently engrossed with a large circle of friends,
and all the variety of claims on their attention and

It was again the 7th of June, and Ellen's birth-
day. Accustomed from the time she became an imac
of Lakewood to regard the anniversary of her birth in
the same serious light as MIrs. Hamilton had taught
her cousins-as a day of quiet reflection, as well as of
thaunkfulness and joy, as one that closing and recom-
fencing another year of their individual lives, taught
them that they were becoming more and more responsible
beings-it was not much wonder that Ellen the whole
of that day should seem somewhat lcss colorful than
usual. She had indeed had many sources of thankful-
ness and joy during the past year, but a heart and
mind like hers could not recall its principal event with-
out a return of sorrow. Mrs. IInmilton would not
notice her now unusual sadness until the evening, when
perceiving her standing engrossed in thought beside
one of the widely-opened windows, ear which Caroline
was watering some lovely flowers on the terrace, she
gently approached her, and, putting her arm around her,
said, fondly-
 You have thought quite seriously and quite long
enough for to-day, my dear Ellen; I must not have any
more such very silent meditations. that there is some-
thing to regret in the retrospect of the last year, I
acknowledge, but you must not let it poison all the
sources of thankfulness which it brings likewise.''
 It was not of my past conduct, I was thinking at
this moment, Aunt Lmmncline-it was-'

though she drew her niece closer to her, and kissed
her fondly. `I hope I shall never be caught in a net,
nor exposed to such horrors and danger as poor Madame
de leury in the French Revolution; but for all that,

worry you; but believe me, when I assure you that nflec-
tion and confidence are the only return I require, united,
as they are in you, with such an earnest desire, and

She was interrupted by the entrance of Emmeline,
with a small parcel in her hand.

 Nana, this has just arrived from exeter for you;
with an apologising message from Mlr. bennet, saying
it should have been here last night, as he promised, but
he could not get the articles from London in time.
I am so very curious as to what it possibly can be, that
I would bring it to you myself.''
Any other time I would punish your constant
curiosity, Melting, by refusing to gratify it. I can-
not do so now, however, for I should punish myself as
well. I i want it most particularly this morning
but I am glad it was not delayed till the day was quite
over. Your Uncle and I did not forget your birthday,
my denr Ellen, though it seemed so.'' And opening
the parcel as she spoke, a very pretty jewel-case appeared,
containing the watch, cross, and all the other trinkets
Ellen had placed in MIrs. Langford's hands, and never
had had the courage to inquire for, and the few her
aunt had kept for her, but so pretty arranged and
beautifully buruished, that she would scarcely have
known them again.
 Did you never feel any curiosity as to the fate of

Zenobia did in her golden chains.''
 I think you might find aprettier single, Emmeline,''
replied Mrs. HAmilton, smiling, as she granted her
request, by throwing the chain round Ellen's week, and
fastening the bracelets on her wrists.

altering, without the smallest hesitation, the lines to suit
her fancy-
